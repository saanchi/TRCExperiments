I've always been the kind of person who would tell you what you wanted to hear, or act how you wanted in order to make you happy. But yet I never knew who I really was, or even wanted to be for that matter. Since moving away from the town I spent the first seventeen years of my life in, I've found that I'm becoming increasingly "artificial". Almost daily I question myself, and when I'm not doing that, I'm feeling like there's no point to anything. 
Now, I'll be the first to admit I have some underlying problems. Between traumatic childhood events(which I would rather not talk about openly), and teenage drug use, I lost sight of my happiness quite a while ago. But I still lack the understanding of why I hate myself so..
I know It's not particularly moving, or even  a tearjerker, I just want to know if anybody else hates themselves, despite not knowing who they are..                
                                            
                        I just want to die. I don't want to be alive anymore.                
                                            
                        I feel so insecure; like I am living alone with no one around me. Essentially, that is not true and yet still I lack the courage to talk to anybody (other than my counselor) . In spite of where I am and have gotten done, I never give myself credit. I am just making excuses for why I am the way I am and not giving myself any hope that things could change.  I always think of other people being better than me in one way or another.  This mindset has been with me for most of my life and just wish it could all just vanish.                
                                            
                        Why do you pretend you care? You always say you are busy. I say let's talk later and then you say you are tired. I ask you if you miss me and you say you do. When I say I love you, you only say "me too". So why do you do this? I don't want to keep asking. Just tell me. You have changed. It's hurting me every day.                
                                            
                        But I try and accept it for what it is. It's not easy though.                
                                            
                        I've been majorly depressed for over 3 years. I'm on medication and I go to therapy but I still cut nearly every day. I used to cry when I cut but now it's just an every day thing like getting dressed or brushing your teeth. I can't even remember ever not being depressed and I hate myself for it. My father left life when my mom and him divorced. He moved close by but he stopped caring, he started saying he didn't want me and didn't love me. Then he started hitting me and my sister. I have a large family, 3 sisters, 1 brother, and 2 nieces. They all live with me in a 2 story house. I'm always being forgotten and left out and I've attempted suicide once already. My family thinks I do it for attention and the people at school ignore my obvious cuts                
                                            
                        Hello. I have a quick medical   that I'm starting to get concerned about. My prozac dosage was recently doubled, and since then has dramatically decreased my appetite. My mood has slowly improved, but I've lost like 7 pounds in the past 2-3 week. Now don't get me wrong, I'm thoroughly pleased with this. I've struggled with an eating disorder in the past, and now I feel like the weight is just falling off of me, and I don't even have to try. But I fear that something bad will happen. I don't know if I'm going to gain it all back in a matter of days, or if my appetite will continue decreasing, and the weight loss will become unhealthy. From a medical point of view, my weight and bmi are absolutely fine. I'd have to lose quite a bit to be considered underweight. Does anyone know anything about effects of medicinally induced decreased appetites?

                        Something that I am still trying to find out. Because after I've mustered up the courage/energy to get out of bed in the morning, look in the mirror, get in the shower and start the day - it is the painful silence of an empty house and an empty heart. After my last relationship and the struggle I had to move on from it, I never found the root of my happiness. I never was content by myself - I don't remember what that even feels like anymore. 
I have been drinking more. I had a beer this morning at 10 AM. It does numb me until the depressive nature kicks in and my eyes flood over. I am so afraid of what my life will be like without a companion, without someone to lean on. I forgot how to lean on myself. I lost my independence and the desire to get that back is real, but it seems nearly impossible. How do you forget the feeling of love? More important, how do you come to accept that the love you felt is gone?

Anyone else struggling with anything like this? Anyone figure out how to fight the loneliness?                
                                            
                        I remember being around 12 years old and experiencing a sinking feeling. It was raw and it seemed to be cutting through me somehow. Some part of me knew back then that I would                
                                            
                        At that moment, I didn't feel anything but abyss of sadness and pain that took over that I cannot even feel anger towards anyone or whatsoever. I didn't even felt like punching someone or something. All is deep sadness. By the time we have escaped from the labyrinth, I felt like I was only being dragged. My companion was hungry and so we stopped by at some store for awhile. She looked here and there in search for something to eat whilst I preferred to sit in the corner watching the people around. I felt so drained even though I didn't really do anything awhile ago. Awhile ago, people around me whom I know were laughing around and having the time of their lives whilst I was like only an observer there. It felt like I've been counting the time the whole time. So when we're at the store and I was able to establish my own personal space somehow, I realized how worthless I am. I realized that I'm only good at looking at the convivial people. I realized that they are happier without me in the picture.
I thought that my agony will be over by the time I arrive home. There was a bit of a miscommunication that took place and I got a response which says, "I do not like you." It's really okay. I cannot please everybody. But at the same time, it's not okay because I was only reasoning out yet the other person seemed to not respect my say. I just feel unaccepted at all--MOST of the time. And when I am feeling fair and I try to communicate with others, it feels like a one sided thing relationship only (if not always, most of the time). I've already stopped hoping for change. But most of the time, I still go for the ironic statement. Nonetheless, deep down, I know that it's over. When I completely quit, nobody would even notice.                
                                            
                        There was this guy I had talked too. and I immediately fell head over heals about him, we talked, we had hung out, he was everything I needed. Then one day he had stopped talking to me, stopped keeping contact with me. So I had asked him what had happened. He basically told me there was another girl, and that me and him were done. From that point on, my grades had went down to F's, my family and I's relationship was horrible, and I felt alone. I wanted to cut myself, I wanted to kill myself. but I had gotten help, so anyone who thinks they aren't good enough. Or they want to die, get help or supportment. I will even be there for you. Stay strong you can get through this, everything can get better in a day                
                                            
                        viewpoint. Letting others know I'm depressed seems to fuel it, to keep me where I am. Pretending I'm not, at least in public, seems to help with my coping. The same goes for my anxiety. If I tell myself "no, you're not feeling that way" I can push myself just a little bit more and sometimes get very positive results. 
But I don't lie to myself. I know when to ask for help.                
                                            
                        My husband and I have been together for 6 years, and during most of that time (and for many years before I met him) I've struggled with depression. He has tried very hard to be understanding, but this most recent bout has lasted for nearly 6 months and I'm not really improving, and he's clearly getting worn out. Has anyone struggled with how depression puts a strain on marriage? And suggestions on what I can do to help (besides, of course, try to get well again)?                
                                            
                        Failure. Alone. Hopeless. My fault, fat, stupid, worthless, looser, lame, ugly, piece of s**t, . These are all the words my skin has acquired over the past 2 weeks. 278 lines. I need to stop. I need help. I don't want to stop. I don't want help.

                        I just moved to louisville ky and I need friends close by.....                
                                            
                        Don't cross me. I would black or fade away and I would comeback hearing my self yell racial slurs out at people. I try not to and to keep my self under control but I just can't. I'm not a racist nor will I ever be. It's just that when people get to me I fade away or black out then comeback to see and hear myself yelling racial slurs. Please, don't think of me as a racist because I yell racial slurs when I black out. It's not even towards the community sometimes I do towards my family. But still I try to hold it in. But just don't get to me.

                        I used to be sure of what I had to do. I had this role and it was hard sometimes but at least I knew what to do and who I was in some sense. Now I don't know, and I'm struggling to be that sure and happy.                
                                            
                        I didn't get enough time to be a kid..                
                                            
                        I used to be friendly. I had a lot of friends. But now I've lost it all. I was depressed and I pushed them away from myself. And now I regret it. All of them away from me now and I miss them a lot. Different cities and I'm no longer seeing any of them. Now I understand the importance of friends.                
                                            
                        I didn't have much of a childhood. My   scarred me emotionally for life. He had a drug problem which made him turn into a different person. He would take me to the park when I was very little and leave me on the swings while he went behind the bush to do drugs which a cop found me alone. My father always had cops at our doors which left me scared of not knowing where he was. He took me to a crack out or whatever you called it, with a creepy guy looking at me. If I knew how he was before I wouldn't go with him and always be scared of not knowing what would happen next. In middle school he escaped from jail which had well not cops but possibly FBI at my door for protection because they believe he was going to try to kidnap me which resulted a day of no school and house arrest. When I saw his picture on the news and information about his counts I went into my closet and cried my eyes out . I started to gain so much weight because I became soo depressed. If I could go back in time I would not start my bad eating habits and I would STAY away from my dad and wouldn't visited my dad in jail. Till this day I have all this emotions built in me that I can't help but cry. I didn't really have a childhood to say I loved it . I wish I can erase everything                
                                            
                        I   looking at my old photographs before I was a dancer. I love seeing how less pained my face was. I love seeing how clean I look. I love seeing how pure I look. I love how innocent I looked. No amount of soap or toothpaste will make it better. The nightmares resurface and bite me.                
                                            
                        but not anymore.  i strive to be normal.                
                                            
                        Some of the decisions I've made in life have scared me forever and changed my life dramatically. 
If only we could turn back time.. Things could be so different. 
How is it fair, why do bad things always happen to good people                
                                            
                        He doesn't have time for me                
                                            
                        I just saw a song and smiled, it reminded me of my deceased brother.
He always used to pick on me when I was little.  Lovingly, of course.  He took the song "Smoke Two Joints" by Sublime and changed the words to fit my name.  He used to sing:
"I beat up two Amanda's in the morning, I beat up two Amanda's at night, I beat up two Amanda's in the afternoon, it makes me feel alright."
Laughing just thinking about it.  I obviously didn't know the real song when I was younger.  It cracks me up now.  He was such a goofball.                
                                            
                        I found an old scrapbook form when I was a child , lots memories , Fist best friend. birthday party's, holidays. Pets I forgot I had. It makes me sad to see all that but at the same time I'm happy.                
                                            
                                        
                                            
                        I Used To Be A Raver Back In 1999 Now I'm "Retired" Lol I seriously went out to raves 2-3 times per week from 1999-2004. That was how I met my current husband. We were both attending a warehouse party in 2002 & he walked up to me & said "didn't I see you at a record store earlier" I said yes & from then on we never left each other. He was my best friend with a month, due to unforeseen circumstances we waited ten years & then got married in 2011. Now we both prefer to stay home vs going out...                
                                            
                        I have a giant plastic bin at home just chalk full of a old pics. Pics from back as a kid, pics from the early days when I was a single 20 something, pics of my kids when they were young, family pics, vacation pics....you name it. They sure being back the memories. Hard to believe my wife and I were ever that young. Time really does fly by. I suppose I should make digital copies before they fade out. Hold on to those old pictures as long as you can. Each and every one is a vivid memory of yesterday and the people that meant so much to us way back when. Many of those fine folks may be gone now, but we still have those pics to take us back to way back when. Cheers all!                
                                            
                        I feel fat. 110 is a big number. I don't know what I'm going to do for Thanksgiving. If I don't eat a lot, my family will ask me unwanted questions. But if I do eat, I'm going to hate myself. How can I eat enough for them to not ask questions, but not feel even more fat? Please help.                
                                            
                        I just want to be healthier than what am I'm tired of being chunky...                
                                            
                        Every one I know say I'm one of the most beautiful girls they've ever met. But ever since I was little I never felt that. I used to try to talk to people about it but they thought I was just fishing for compliments. I might be okay with clothes on, I have a good body shape and I know I don't have an ugly face (to some) but with out clothes off.... :( mostrar people have issues about thinking they are fat, but my problem is different, I have darker skin under my arms and in between my thighs. That's not the worst part.. I have hair on my lower back. I push everyone I date away because I feel sorry for them and I don't ever want them to have to live or deal with someone as disgusting as me. I'm just gross. I hate my body.                
                                            
                        I'd obviously rather be relaxed about how people see me, but I'm pretty self conscious sadly, I constantly worry about how I'm viewed.                
                                            
                        Sometimes I feel maybe it'd best thing if I didn't exist. Being the only person I know that has hair on lower back makes me realize how gross I really am.                
                                            
                        After putting on about 30 lbs of fat over the summer I feel like I'm still getting fatter since then. I don't know how to feel about this, I don't even eat that much, I think it's just my laziness and lack of any exercise. I also snack sometimes more than I should. 
I weighted a bit over 220 before the summer started, when I stepped on the scale like a month ago I've fattened up to 260 lbs. I don't even want to step on the scale now, because I think I'll be even fatter. 
I guess the upcoming winter and christmas holidays aren't going to help much either. I don't even want to see the number that pops up on the scale after christmas. 
I'm sure most of my weight is just fat, I've got big rolls of fat around my belly with huge moobs on top of that. My thighs aren't any thinner either.                
                                            
                        I had to go to the doctors and because she hasn't seen me in a while, or maybe she just noticed that I'm looking fatter, she wanted to weight me in. 
I've stepped on the scale and a number saying 265lbs popped up, wow, I didn't really expect to be this fat. I knew that I put on some weight over the summer as I've noticed that my belly is fatter, but I had no idea how much. 
I got told that I'm obese and I should go on a diet and start exercising to lose some weight. (I knew that's not going to happen, I love food too much to get on a diet and I'm too lazy, fat and out of shape to exercise. I can't even do a push-up or sit-up, let alone something like running.) 
After that she wanted to measure my belly, so she brought the measure tape and tried to reach it around, without success. Apparently the 50" measure tape wasn't big enough, so I just stood there shirtless, a bit embarassed with my belly hanging way over my waist and moobs sticking out. 
I have to go there again in a few months and apparently she expects me to lose some weight in that time, I'm not really sure what to do now.                
                                            
                        I have lots of little scars but one great big cesarean scar from having my little girl and I am so proud of it they did such a good job too it's just like a thin hairline                
                                            
                        Hey there. First of all I want to say that I'm so happy to be embarking on this amazing journey to getting a bigger, fatter and rounder belly. This is my first post and I would appreciate it greatly if someone could help me gain belly fat, preferably in a way that doesn't involve consuming tons of junk food. Answers are welcome.

                        At the moment I have a bmi of 20, which is pretty healthy. Although, I want to get very fat. I have tried a lot of diets(all the ones I can) and they do not work... If anyone on here knows how to help me then that would be AMAZING! So. Umm.. Comment below and if you wanna chat then I'm on here a lot so. Yea. Bye                
                                            
                        I am 5'3. Im short and petite but curvy. I used to wish I was a little taller but now I embrace my height and size. Guys can easily carry me in their arms or on their backs and I'm still tall enough for all roller coaster rides.  And someone's bad breath doesn't affect short people as much.                
                                            
                        Only when other people take the photo, I can edit and only publish ones I like of myself. :)                
                                            
                        Last year I got really depressed over my   /ex and just lost my appetite completely for over 6 months and I was eating around 400 calories max per day, and I lost so much weight in that time. Then things started to get better in my life for abit and I put on all the weight again in less than a few weeks. I wish I could lose it all again soon.                
                                            
                        Enjoy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ;)                
                                            
                        I don't know what that ad is for, but the choices are band-aids, staples, and ethanol.  Band-aids, that's no fun!  First I staple him up, then I pour on the ethyl alcohol.  I just can't keep my mouse away rom the stapler and the alcohol.  Ouch.                
                                            
                        Stalin-  "Death solves all problems. No man no problem." 
This in every aspect is true. That's what should happen. I don't mean to one man but to every man. If there are no more people on the planet then there will be no more suffering or pain. No one would be in control and no one wouldn't be in control. So it would be complete and total peace.                
                                            
                        So people really want to know my dark side ?? Ok, let me say this i will be your worst nightmare !!! i dnt have compassion, i will beat you with my very own fist i will punch and break every single bone inside your skull i will pound your face until i cant no more i wont know if your dead or not but its not like i freakin care anyways. i turn violently i wont stop until i see you had more than enough i will be near death but wont die i will take you first n make it painful for you no b.s but you will wish you never were born i am your worst nightmare cuz i will find you and make you SUFFER !!

                        I was always emotional as a child, prone to extreme fits of rage and depression. I attempted suicide in 8th grade. It wasn't until I was 21 yrs old and in the hospital that I was diagnosed with Bipolar II. 5 years later the way I view myself has changed, I question everything I do. I was hypomanic during the week I took the Law School Admission Test (LSAT) and have continued to suffer bouts of depression, self-injury, and hypomania. I am glad I foud this place to speak openly about it since all my friends think I am just moody.                
                                            
                        Excuse me Mother, 
May i talk to you?
No my dear, 
You've done enough talking for two. 
Im sick of your excuses,
All the blame on your mental illness, 
Hurry up and get over this. 
Everyday with you is another problem,
Highs and lows..
Sit the F.ck down and slow down. 
You're temper is annoying, 
As well as your rapid thoughts. 
Id thought we'd gotten past this, 
Oh wait, 
You're "bipolar", 
I forgot.                
                                            
                        My boyfriend was recently diagnosed with  . Its been so tough on me also. How do you ladies deal with your bf who's also been diagnosed?                
                                            
                        I had a spider visit my lab, every few months. He made my students screem, terroirising them.
Don't worry I said, it is only Ken.
I put this spider on a piece of paper, opend the window and let him gently float down to the lower floor.
Several months later he visited again. Terrorised and I moved him on. I never hurt him.
Australian spiders can be very vicious, beware of those called Ken.                
                                            
                        

So who the loser ????
                                            
                        Lilapsophobia - Fear of Tornadoes and Hurricanes. 
I don't really know if I'm phobic of hurricanes as I've never been in one. However, I am EXTREMELY phobic of tornadoes. I get so nervous I'll make myself physically sick to the point of vomiting. It wouldn't be as bad (hopefully) if we had functioning tornado sirens... but, we don't... and haven't since the 90's. 
I've been phobic since I was 8 years old, when I actually remember a tornado hitting downtown. It didn't cause much damage... but it still freaked me out big time. 
I also have intense fear of syringes since the age of 19 when I almost accidentally stuck myself with my uncle'a heroin needle that he'd hidden in some rolled up phone cord.                
                                            
                        I'm scared my boyfriend will leave me .                
                                            
                        Dont know how it started but I know this for sure, people are there only to get me. Everyone is plotting against me.. everyone is talking against me, everyone wants me dead, everyone looks at me to talk  about me afterwards, everyone asks me name to me sure they havent heard it before on p.o.r.n sites, everyone thinks im a s.l.ut. nobody wants to touch me they wanna shower afterwards... this is what I constantly think.. what if everyone leaves me and what if i stop getting food everyday and what if i cant be what i wanna be.. and what if i cant commmit suicide nicely it will land me in legal trouble and what if i live.. nobody will let me.. and what if i ... oh god im going insane.... my paranoia is too high, I will worry about the most silliest things n my behaviour is also not normal I have been told...im never at ease, im so uncomfortable around people... I dont even know whats real what is unreal who is real who is not.. who means what.. what means what.. im always confused, I already said I have lost all my self confidence.. I just look at people and wonder how they are sitting walking n why cant I be normal like them, sometimes I can be but only sometimes..                
                                            
                        I don't know why but wherever I go I encounter a spider, it's like I purposely look for them and they always do the weird circle movement that looks so intimidating, I hate spiders wish they all died :(                
                                            
                        Im 14 year old girl gonna be 15 year in June . Ive been dealing with emetophobia for 4 years . And let me just say it has been a rough 4 years . I started having the fear of vomit when i was 10 and i vomited in the car . It was such a horrible experience , it tramatized me . Now when ever i hear smell see , anything related to vomit . I start having panic attacks . Some kid threw up in my class , and instead of him being super sick , i was . They had to call the ambulence to come to the school cuzz i was just panicking and not breathing properly . I dont have alot of friends cuzz of this phobia , and ive lost alot of boyfriends cuzz they think its weird . Its so the point where i was once super over weight , to almost losing 57 pounds . Im terrified to eat , thinking in my head if it will make me sick or not . I dont wanna live like this . I dont wanna be like this when i become a mother and wife and my kids or husbands feel sick and i just wanna stay as far away from them . I just wish i didnt have to deal with this                
                                            
                        He was too young for that too happen. So close to the holidays also.                
                                            
                        I haven't been doing well in school because of health reasons and depression. I was getting almost perfect on everything in the beginning, now I've failed my first assignment and I feel like I haven't improved in my work at all. It's only the first semester of the next 4 years for me... I don't wanna fail and be kicked out of school after I've worked so hard to get in.                
                                            
                        Well first of I have a huge fear of spiders and any sort of flying/crawling insect or bug of any sort. Secondly, I fear getting hurt and falling out of love. I'm afraid of change, and I will do anything to prevent or or save it from happening.                
                                            
                        I have always HATED flies (I mean who doesn't) but only recently last year I've been afraid of them. I think it was because in year 8 camp, I camped somewhere buzzing with flies. There were at least 20 fat flies buzzing around you the entire day. Literally! And the worst part was, they bit you and it stung!! 
Whenever I hear the sound of a fly, I cover my ears and get as far away as possible. Even today a fat fly accidently flew into me and suddenly my pulse raced super fast and my breathing was shallow and quick. They are so disgusting and such pests! I get scared when they get near me and sometimes scream. 
Unlike other girls i'm not afraid of things like snakes, spiders, alligators or any reptiles. So it's weird don't you think?
So that's my weird phobia                
                                            
                        I have only recently come to the conclusion that I deal with problems by avoiding them. 
I know that might sound stupid but sadly it is true. For far too long, I avoided dealing with my problems and instead, I just shut myself off from a lot of people. There were many good people in my life but I pushed them away because I couldn't deal with my issues. 
I kept putting things off. I'd do it tomorrow, etc. I didn't want to face anything negative. 
It'll take a long time but I will not avoid my problems any more. I intend to tackle my life head on from this moment.  I will not live in fear or negativity any longer.                
                                            
                        I've been dating this guy for almost three Months!i love being with him but sometimes I think about another(not going to happen through )boyfriend has dated aloof girls and have done lists of things he's okay doing nothing! I love sitting there and talking about different movies with him we can talk for hours on movies them self!!!!!!! We laugh and oaky games!!  He's has the girl that is a friend I don't know i pretty sure it's more of a best friend he keeps her text and I know she has lover feelings  and he knows how I feel but he does it anyway! He finals gets off from work on Saturday! so on the buss she goes mike I need toy to come over and help move things he's like yes I have nothing to due!!!! Then he saves her texts on his phone I don't like it what do I do ?? ;":'( :)                
                                            
                        I'm a scardy cat. I don't need a nite lite but I have to keep my door open. I hav scary dreams sometimes so I think that is part of the problem. But today since I'm sick I'm all alone and that's worse!!! I can't have my back against the door lol.                
                                            
                        Ever since I was little, I had issues with my family. My parents always fought and my sister made me feel so bad. I've always been self conscious  and anxious. But one day things just got so bad. I wanted to just die, I felt everyone was a hundred times better off without me. On October 21 I took over 40 Tylenol and some of my dad's muscle relaxers. I felt extremely terrible within fifteen minutes, I tried to lay down until I was gone but my mom was taking me to quit drama, so I couldn't just stay home. When I finally did get back I threw up and then I thought about how it wasn't going to work right away. I don't know exactly what the mess were going to do to me at the time and after a while I thought, maybe I should tell someone. I told my mom and she took me to the hospital in no time. The only one who wasn't suprised was me. Nobody saw it coming appearently, but my mom stayed at the hospital for 2 whole days with me, for the first time in so long, I felt like somebody cared. And suddenly my family started to realize how I felt. (Except for my dad who is just flat out pathedic and rediculously mean) I was glad it didn't work. Sometimes I wish I succeeded, (my sister does too) but honestly, I was lucky to only spend 4 days in the hospital. And if I failed then it'd just make everything worse.                
                                            
                        I have given my heart to a man that is has taken it and has broken it up in very small pieces, but I can't seem to let him go.
As of late my boyfriend has been acting up. Last week he got extremely drunk. The things he said to me were horrible. So when I confronted him about it a couple days later, he said that he didn't remember much from that night and apologized for his actions. He also admitted to me that he might have a problem.
Which brings me to last night. We went out for my company celebration and he again got extremely drunk. The things he said to me hit me so deep that I just broke down and started to cry. 
He admitted to me that within the past few weeks he also smoked weed, which I knew he did in the past but said he had stopped after his last mental breakdown in June. He told me that smoking weed was his #1 thing in life. When I asked him why I wasn't #1 he said that nothing or nobody will ever replace weed and everything about it. Which then again he stated that he might have a problem.
I really feel that this his cry for help. I'm very willing to help him get the treatment he needs. I just don't know how to go about with it. So here my heart breaks everyday more and more for a man that I love and care about deeply.                
                                            
                        I kicked my husband out a month ago for cheating and we are currently in the divorce process. I've already slept with someone else  and been asked on date but I feel more lonely than ever. I hate it. I have no one to talk to but my 2 year old and let's be honest, it's not exactly stimulating conversation. I feel like no one will like me because of my weight and situation in life.                
                                            
                        I've pushed away everyone in some way or another. I take so many "meds" it's insane. Sometimes I feel hopeless, like there's no way out. When I feel that way, I'm very very close to ending my life. Other times I look outside and see the sun shining and thank God I'm alive. Other times my mind races like I've done a line of coke and I won't eat or sleep for days simply because I don't need it and I couldn't even if I wanted to. I hold so much of this inside that no one really knows how hard it is for me. I wish I could find the right words to make them understand...to make you understand. I just want out.                
                                            
                        I have tried a few times over the years to die the first time I ever tried it was when I was about 16 I was miserable and having a hard time at school and home and I didn't know what to do. I tried taking a bunch of random pills and all that did was make me sick I spent a lot of time throwing up. I failed because I had no clue what I was doing or how much I had to take and of what. I tried again when I was going on 20. At the time I was homeless as well as jobless and like the first time I didn't know what to do everything seemed hopeless so I tried with antifreeze i stole from a hardware store. All that did was make me wind up in the hospital getting my stomach pumped. Even to this very day I still want to die at times                
                                            
                        Okay, so I was searching to post a morbid experience about how depressed I am. Like an attention seeking whre. Then I saw "Suicide survivor" if you committed suicide, you're dead. If you attempted to commit suicide you did not survive suicide. You survived your attempt to commit suicide. Duhhhhhh.                
                                            
                        These past few months have been horrible, people all around me have been committing suicide. I never knew a single one if them but to here what they did, breaks my heart. No one is ever alone. You may think that you are but once your gone, you'll actually see who cares, but that will be too late. If your ever thinking to cut yourself or end it, think again. It might put you out of your misery, but it will hurt the people around you. 
There was this girl in my class, I didn't know a thing about her but she seemed to be okey, she had friends and everything. Until one week she seemed different. She didn't talk to anyone, not even her friends. But I did notice something she was wearing a cardigan and where I live it is very very hot! So I knew right away she was cutting.I asked her friends if they knew what was wrong with her, they didn't know. I couldn't see her like this. I am a sensitive person and I can't stand to see someone hurt. I didn't want to talk to her because I could have made things worse. So instead I talked to a teacher/adult about it. The following week she was herself again, and I her cuts on her arm were slowly healing and she was seeing a therapist.
My story is true. This just shows that people are looks out for you even though they aren't  your friends. If anyone ever needs to talk, I'm always here :)                
                                            
                        I've been so down lately... I'm hardly ever happy anymore. Somedays I struggle to get out of bed. I'm miserable any suggestions?                
                                            
                        I have tried to kill myself 13 times. And yet here I am. I just end up back in the ER every time. Is it fate or just my soul being to much of a coward to die. I have no reason to live so why am I still here!?                
                                            
                        I don't do this often at all really, this is the first time I've signed up for something like this. I left my ex nearly a year ago but only because she didn't want to be with me. I loved her and I was really sad for a long time. I'm an amateur kickboxer and I thought I could get over it by pouring myself into my training. I had a few fights within the next few months and decided to leave for Thailand and live at a kickboxing gym. Somehow I was still kind of depressed even though I was doing what I love in a beautiful country. After a month I'm back and still very very sad. I feel useless because I can't get her back and there aren't any fights coming up around here. 
I used to smoke quite a lot of weed. Every day. I don't smoke much at all now but at the time I used it as a crutch to kind of forget about her. I often find myself very lonely because I'm already pretty introverted and end up just sulking about how sad I am. I hate it. It's like I'm sad for no reason but I know that's not it.
Above all though its the loneliness that gets me. I always feel so lonely. I just want to have a companion I guess, not just some girl but someone that I really connect with and love.
I'm sure this post is kind of disjointed but I don't post on the internet ever, so forgive me If this post seems kind of nonsensical.                
                                            
                        life can be hard, everyone knows this.
life can throw you curve balls, everyone knows this.
people can be sad from time to time, everyone knows this.
the emptiness that exists at the bottom of a severe depression
clouds a person's entire thinking process, NO ONE knows this.
the isolation of depression is unbearable, NO ONE knows this.
the cliff we stand at seems like the only option, NO ONE knows this.
the hopelessness that leads us to the cliff is endless, NO ONE knows this.
everyone around us calls us cowards, they have no clue.
doctors think they understand, they have no clue
family tries to understand, they have know clue.
ONLY someone that has been there can understand.
if you are thinking about it, talk to someone who understands.
if you are really standing at the cliff, go to the Emergency Room NOW.
I've been to the other side and there is NOTHING there.
As bad as things can get here, 
  THIS is where we matter
  THIS is where WE CAN GET HELP
  THIS is where we can rebuild
Stay here, stay alive, stay in touch.

                        Sometimes I feel like I am the only one who can see the truth behind life and it scares me. I see people worrying about school, relationships, and other problems and I'm jealous of them. Why cant I just worry about normal stuff? Why don't they see how pointless everything is? That we grow up, get an education, work, retire and die plain and simple. Life is just a cruel joke to me... I want to leave, to finally escape. I feel trapped, everyday going through the same routines of life. I constantly have suicidal thoughts.. but I am too much of a coward to go through with anything. I just want to go peacefully.. from what I have heard about overdose a lot can go wrong and it can be painful, not to mention I hate pills and avoid taking them even when I'm extremely sick. I'd hang myself but I'm useless at doing anything right so I would probably end up messing that up some how. I can't take it anymore I just want to die.                
                                            
                        My name is Theo. I'm a 13 year old genderfluid suicidal person. My life isn't that bad at home; no serious abuse, just some spankings and yelling. I've been depressed as long as I can remember, as well as scratching, burning, and cutting myself. I have a brother (Jake) and my parents. I do not believe that they are my real parents because I don't think a real parent would make their child want to kill themselves and tell everyone about every hospitalization they've had and why. I don't believe that they would make that child feel worse by yelling at them about getting a D on a quiz. I don't think that they would ban the things that save them because they're 'promoting violence' or 'just yelling' or 'going to make you fall into your fantasy world again.'. I don't believe that they would scream at them because of a napkin that missed the trash or to 'change so the people don't tease you'. 
So, I do not believe they are my real parents.
Real parents wouldn't lie to them about where you're going ('We're going to Grandma's, not the hospital!') and they wouldn't force them to eat ('Your body will shut down if you don't!') or take away their iPod when they're in bed ('You need your sleep!'). They would love them and not tell anything to anyone and not betray them and let them read and listen to WHATEVER THEY WANT. 
Sorry for my rant, but I had to get it out.                
                                            
                        I'm in so much pain.
My medicine isn't working
There's been many times I've thought of taking a handful of pain pills.                
                                            
                        This is a story that I thought I wouldn't tell but after talking with one user I think I need to tell it. I'm not telling this story for and pity or for someone to comment on it. I'm telling this story for the people that need to hear it so they can understand that suicide is not the answer no matter how bad life is on the surface. For me life has been a true struggle. Not growing up without a father, living in a family with drug and emotional problems, getting picked on in school everyday and struggling with my sexuality till this day anyone would think I should have lost it a long time ago. It wasn't till the summer of 2012 that I finally had enough of everything. For someone like me being in a relationship let alone dating someone was a very big accomplishment. This girl made me feel very special about myself like no one ever had. I really thought she was the one for me. Well not only was she the wrong one but also the worst one for me ever. As I thought things for us were going great she had other plans. I was walking down the street going to get something from the store when I see her in the arms of another man. I approach the two of them and she tells me she had been with him the entire time she was with me. The real knife in the heart for me was he knew about me and didn't care because there plan was for her to take me for all the money I had and leave me feeling like a fool. After the truth was exposed the girl just looked the crush me in every way. She would tell me she never loved me, she just used me for my hard earned money and didn't care if I lived. This hit me in the worst ways possible. I felt like the worlds dumbest man. This feeling of being completely crushed had all of my emotions and reasons in a tailspin. The warm air woke me up that morning. I looked out my window seeing the brightness of the outside. The wild feeling of a panic attack was creeping up on me. I just kept getting hotter and hotter. My eyes just swelled up with tears. Without even thinking of a reason to stop I picked up he first sharp ob
                                            
                        I am the shadow in the dark
I am the ghost in the crowd
I am the background in the story
I am the wall at the party
I am the silent night 
I am the shade at night 
I am the colorless white 
I am the shining light 
I am the puzzle to be solved 
I am the question to be asked
Yet, I can't be answered that fast
So find me while I last
I am the soldier in battle 
Fighting to be me
From the ones who want me to change
But I can only stay one fr
                                            
                        It's always been a battle to be quiet, shy while wishing I was more like all my outgoing friends. Over the years, I have learned to overcome or hide my introverted personality.  I still cringe when I must speak during business meetings or worse training sessions but I've learned to smile & pretend I'm outgoing! Now once I get to know someone - I never shut up!                
                                            
                        I have never been to prison before. I like to think I'm a good guy who try to stay out of trouble, but I know someone who served time...I was hanging out in my cousin's room with my cousin and his friend, the former inmate. This inmate friend of mine, whom I shall refer to as 'M', looked like some UFC fighter, not some guy you want to mess with. We were all hanging out and since I don't know 'M' very well, I remained silent and listen in the conversation between him and my cousin. About thirty minutes in 'M' asked me if everything is all right with me, since I did not say a single word. I responded with, "yeah, I'm good. Thanks." Still not knowing what to say or talk about, I kept silent. At that point 'M' started to fidget around and I can see that he was getting uncomfortable, but still, I kept silent with my own thoughts. He then took quick glances around me, but I didn't look back. At that point, I think he felt creeped out. After awhile, he decided to leave and I can remember him telling me to talk more. He asked me if I'm in a relationship and I responded in the negative. He then told me that is the reason for being single and was teasing me about it and then left. As I said above, I have never been to prison, but this whole ordeal felt like I was in a prison: being stuck in a small room with two other while listening to small talks. But, if I were to go to prison, I'll be armed.                
                                            
                        I've always been a nervous person. Even as apreschooler I always felt like people would abandon me if I didn't pelase them, do what ever they say. When someone is mad at me I just want to hide in my room. I always have this naucious feeling. I can never eat much and get anerexic sometimes.
There are brief periods when I feel somewhat ok when I;m with the company of someone else and I have their attention. 
My mom takes me to therapy but it's never about me it seems. Only about what she thinks are bad things I do. 
Sometimes I just want to run away from everything                
                                            
                        I think I am a pathological liar. 
This past weekend I went to a retreat and it was fun, but we did some bonding exercises that got pretty personal. One of them was to anonymously write a secret/insecurity on a piece of paper that we wanted to let go of and then read them out loud and burn them indicating that the problem was let go of. My roommate (although she doesn't know that I know) wrote that someone in her everyday life is a kleptomaniac and pathological liar and that she wishes she had thought about it before she decided to live with someone because it is an everyday occurrence. I had noticed she had put a lock on her door and stopped leaving anything around downstairs that she owned and I knew that she thought that, but this weekend just made me realize how big of a deal it is because she wrote it down. 
Naturally, when it was read out loud I knew that she was talking about me (the kleptomania part gave it away because we had coincidentally bought the same blanket but she couldn't find hers and because I couldn't find the receipt she thinks I took hers which I PROMISE I didn't...petty and stupid, I know, but she took great offense to it and stole it from my room) and started analyzing the liar part. I knew I was prone to lying but it has gotten out of hand. I lie about my entire life and I want to stop. I'm not looking for someone to help me stop, I just need someone to share this with because I think just talking to someone and being able to tell them that I told a lie might help me. I really want people to be able to trust the words that are coming out of my mouth so now I've come here in hopes that I'll find someone who is also a liar and we can share with each other because after tons of research I am pretty sure that I am a pathological liar.                
                                            
                        I honestly don't even know I'm lying until I get told by someone I'm lying. I believe every word that comes out of my mouth like it's 100% true and I'm sick of it. Of course I like it for the attention because I like it. I have five other siblings and I only had the spotlight when I was little. They just brush me off now :S I don't lie like this to anybody I love. But it's getting carried away. I've been working on it and I haven't lied to anyone recently that I'm aware of! So that's a start! :D                
                                            
                        I have been suffering from debilitating   and panic attacks for the past few years. It got so bad that just the thought of having another anxiety attack actually triggered one. But after finding a site that adequately explained what anxiety attacks are, I have been able to prevent myself from having another one.The webpage described how we trigger our own panic attacks with our thoughts. It starts with negative thoughts. The negative thoughts keep festering until it leads to anxiety. The anxiety leads to a full on panic attack. The panic attack in turn leads to more negative thoughts. And the circle continues. It is up to us to break this cycle in ourselves.It starts with rejecting negative thoughts and regarding them as just that... negative thoughts. If you can manage to steer your mind away from these negative thoughts, instead of feeding them, you can prevent yourself from triggering your own anxiety attacks. I for one have found this approach very effective thus far.                
                                            
                        I've had panic attacks for about 3 years now. My parents brought me to about 50 doctors, a shrink, a hypnotist! And I'm now on my second psychologist! I'm after missing about 2 full years of school work (which included state examinations, I passed all exams but only barley). I have had home school but I get home schooled in school? It's like in a small room with me and my teacher. I just got prescribed Meds  from my psychologist. They are starting to work and I'm going to half of my classes! The problem is I can't rid myself of the feeling that everyone is staring at me, judging me or talking about me. I can't bring it up with my friends because I'm afraid that they will think I'm self centred. I know this post is pointless but it's just a few things I needed to get if my chest.

Sometimes I am the happiest person you know. The guy that makes you laugh. The guy that has no troubles. The guy you call when you need to offload your worries.
Sometimes I am not..
The times I am not, it hurts. I try to cover it up. Compensate and pretend it's fine. To be low is to be weak, or so I thought.... 
To be honest helps us to heal. To hear out loud what we say over and over in our heads helps take away the power our internal voices have. 
This site helps... Who knew....                
                                            
                        Schizoaffective disorder, is better than being Schizophrenic, but worse than being just bipolar, it is in between, a combination of both. I used to be a pure schizophrenic, but by the grace of God when my darkness turned to light, my diagnosis changed from Schizophrenia to Schizoaffective, I really did notice a great change in my life, with much more abundant peace, I was surrounded with more beauty than darkness.
This Is The Soundtrack Of My Life Living With Schizoaffective Disorder Every song I post is an excellent representation of what I went through living with Schizoaffective disorder from the very first voice to my mania to the hardships I've endured. What brought me to the faith in God who was the only one who was ever on my side which led me to peace, turning my darkness to light. I especially love the Christian songs. I would rather worship God than worship man any day! And learn to love All people. I've never felt this healthy before. And it's all because I felt that God would be the best therapy for me, and He was, I still love my psychologist, and I do still take medication which helps me stay stable, better than I could do on my own, but.....The only thing that could guide and truly heal me was the grace of God.

                        My parents while I grew up were: hyper-protective, never let me do anything alone, except watching tv.  I was coerced into relationships and have yet to date someone I was interested in genuinely and on my own.  
Now I am older, my parents are: clingy and always worried about me.  
Schoolwork almost never gets done without other people encouraging or helping me
I've had substance abuse issues. 
I have multiple places to get attention and "help" 
I have an obsession with helping others. 
I don't have many friends and aleinate many people.  
I was recently labeled with this and the diagnosis could change. 
I have suffered abuse for fear of losing company. 
I've hurt other people or at least annoyed them with this.  
I found out while hospitalized. 
I found out at 31.  
I am not in a relationship and don't have many friends.  
I also suffer from other psych conditions, which may be caused by this underlying disorder.                
                                            
                        I cannot believe I have been so blind for song long. he was cheating and lieing and using me for money. I couldn't imagine it would happen to me because I am pretty and cultured and no no no it couldnt be true! But it completely was. He would makeup ridiculous stories about his ex photo shopping scree n shots of him trying to get back with her. I found a compact in his room. I just knew something was wrong. I didn't want to admit it. Everything was always about him, his needs, he eventually got me to sign for a car for him which he was supposed to pay for , but never did. When he broke up with me he just dumped the car and all my stuff at my apt int he middle of the night too cowardly to see me. Its unbelievable. When his ex had told me what he did I tried to break up with me but he begged me to stay and to marry hi. The next week he decided he wouldn't do that and it just got worse from there . He started to make me feel lesser like I couldnt be patient for those things. He would say all the time I want them too in time. If I tried to approach any subject he didn't like he was cold and would shut down and would blame me. He always needed space and wanted me to prove I had control and could not contact him while he had to get over whatever it was he said I had done. It was horrible, but I stayed in denial because I was ashamed and because I loved the man he was supposed to be. I was devastated when we broke up and still wish he was that man. It is so hard to wrap my head around and t accept the reality. IT HURTS                
                                            
                        Today once I came back from the store with yet another unneeded purchase and seeing the look in my husbands eyes was a wake up call that I need to admit I have a compulsive habit.  I realize I need to stop this now as it can totally destroy my family but don't know how to curb it. Where do I begin and why is it so hard for me to just be able to not buy everything I see that I like.                
                                            
                        Is it normal to be worried everyday about the person who molested you being released?
is it normal to have mightmares remembering what happened when you were a child?
is it normal to have so many questions that they make your head go fuzzy so much that you can't think?                
                                            
                        I was always a shy, reserved, sensitive person, who never said anything mean or did anything wrong, I was always too afraid of what others might think of me, that is they might not like me. I guess I was desperate to be "liked" because I tried so hard but never received the recognition I felt I deserved. I mostly tried to fly under the radar, to be unnoticed even though I stood out like a sore thumb, being brown in a majority white environment. I wasn't aware of the stigma that was attached to my race in my country, I was young, knew nothing about the attitudes of those from the past to then present and how much of an impact the narrow mindedness had had on the kids my age. Racism was a foreign word to me but I felt the effect of it with every inch of my being. The way I was treated, like an outcast, untrustworthy, worthless, useless. I felt ugly, 
hopeless and helpless. I only had one "friend" at primary school and she was my neighbour. Her family were lovely people, I will never forget how they welcomed me with open arms. They were the exception. Everyday was a like a battle, never ending small minded attitudes. The acceptance I craved, I was never shown by my peers. 
High school was better and worse at the same time. I finally made a few more friends, thanks to people knowing people. But that didn't help the isolation I felt. I started playing basketball when I was 11, I had been playing netball since I was 7. Basketball was an unknown sport to me, it wasn't very popular in NZ. What a game though, I loved playing it. I was better at it than netball. I wasn't the tallest but I liked the fact that there was more "contact" I suppose, that you could get in there and get in peoples faces. I could get out my aggression and frustration and enjoy the fact. Our community was small though and I played both sports with the same girls. My friends weren't either into sport or not in my teams, so I was lone styles all the time. 
One person in particular took full advantage. Others would either steer clear of her, stand up to her or to my detriment, join her. She liked to belittle me, make fun of me, bully me. I would say nothing, do nothing, but it would never end. I wasn't the only person she did it too but I couldn't help myself let alone anyone else. I had no one to tell or talk to about it, I felt so alone. That went on for years yet I would not give up my sports, they meant too much to me. I finally got the courage and opportunity to show her I wasn't going to take it anymore. She tried to push me out of the way, but I stood my ground, she pushed harder and harder, but I wouldn't budge. Never forget the look on her face, it was like wtf mixed with a little bit of new found respect. She would still tease me after it but not to the same extent. 
There were 3 unforgettable moments where I felt like there is justice in the world, with regards to my painful youth. The first was my last year at primary, I was 13. I decided I was going to try out for the lead in the end of the year Christmas play. Which wasn't a Christmas play, it was a "black comedy", I auditioned and won the lead. I amazed myself. After the performance I got so many compliments from parents and teachers. I felt like a million bucks. 
The 2nd time was when I played in a basketball tournament but didn't make the top team, played in the invitation team instead. I was however recognised for my ability and leadership because I wasn't playing with the girls who would get more attention than they deserved. I won a place in the tournament team, and was presented a certificate and got to stand beside "that" girl in front of all our peers, I felt like royalty. 
The 3rd time, the whole country saw exactly what kind of a loser she was, due to her height, not ability, she represented our country in netball. It was the finals and I was watching with my best mate and "she" crumbled, bit the bullet in front of everyone. I was so pleased, I could but couldn't barely believe it. 
That was a karmic moment for me, she was exposed for the fraud she was, in NZ we are not kind to losers. 
I have since tried to move on from my ordeals, if I meet anyone or see anyone who is a bully, I tell them straight up  exactly what I think of them. I give my son the advice I think  he needs to arm himself against bullying. No child should ever experience what I went through, I have learned that being kind, showing kindness, advising kindness may be the best way we can combat the irrepressible problem.                
                                            
                        I'm seriously thinking we need licences to be parents. Psyche evaluations, proof of responsibility with children, extensive parenting course experience, too much to ask? I think not. Same goes for pets. 
Child abuse and animal abuse is abhorrent. We need to put a stop to the vicious cycle, reduce the damage on society as a whole. I constantly see around me unfit individuals who don't deserve the privilege of caring for special beings. 
Love is an all encompassing word, and often abused, it does not mean the right to hurt, harm, abuse, use, inflict, restrict, shame, blame, extort, exhibit, inhibit, prohibit beings or other. 
I feel ill about it all. I am a mum, I love my kids, they mean the world to me, I have done parenting courses and will do more, given opportunities, to learn and better myself in the process and be the best parent I can be. I am not by any means the "perfect" parent but I will try my absolute hardest to be.
I feel I also have a responsibility to all the children in my community, city, country and even the world. I will endeavour to help as many as I can in my lifetime. 
I know what true love is when I see in the eyes of my kids and my husband just how much they adore and appreciate me:))                
                                            
                        Yep.. I was.  .-. I liked it. 
Imma weirdo xD                
                                            
                        I was raised to respect others and women, it really upsets me to hear the about physical and verbal abuse women deal with from men. It's so wrong to abuse anyone child, woman or man. My prayers go out to those who deal with it and may you find peace in God's will.                
                                            
                        I think that its totally not okey and i jade when someone does it .                
                                            
                        "I wasn't very excited at the thought of sharing my past with the world. I always hid behind my pain and acted as if life was great. My biggest accomplishment was getting out of my abusive relationship after 12 years. The downside was that relationship still haunted me and I allowed it to reside in my life. As I grew spiritually, I wanted to know what my purpose in life was. I have always been the shoulder to lean on and always gave great advice to others. Today I'm learning to apply my advice to not only others but myself. I'm no longer willing to hide behind my shadow of domestic abuse. It happened to me just like it happens to many. I am standing tall with my head held high and sharing my story with the hope and prayer that I can reach someone. If I can save a young girl from ignoring the signs of a controlling boyfriend or help a women realize she's better than walking around bruised and banged up that will be enough. This is a platform where confidentiality is a MUST. If you need someone to listen I'm here. I truly believe I endured the trials of a abusive relationship to bring me to this point I'm at today. My ultimate goal is TO HELP. GOD WON'T PUT ANYTHING ON YOU THAT YOU CAN'T BEAR!
                                            
                        I've had   and low self esteem for most of my life. Family members capitalized on this during a hard time in my life and as I trusted them they worked to erode my remaining self-esteem. Criticisms, jabs at my skills, lots of gossip and rumor spreading, and actual sabotage. One of them even contacted my workplace to get me fired and to prevent me from getting a job at another place by contacting them during the hiring process.
They promise to help but they always just want to control me and to make me feel like a nobody. They lie through their teeth and always make sure to keep me down somehow. They won't take "no" for an answer. Their often unsolicited offers for "help" are just ways of keeping me close to them so they can wear me down with their criticisms, demands, and negativity. When I call them out on them they say things like "I only do it to help you". I cut all ties with one of them and still to this day she spends time gossiping about me and calling me crazy (to deflect attention from speculation about her sanity, I suppose).
I developed an digestive illness which is still undiagnosed. One of them offered "help" in the form of paying for health insurance. Sounds nice, right? But the point was to make me see psychiatrists and get a diagnosis of some form of mental disorder to discredit me and have me institutionalized. I've seen emails of her discussing how I need to be put into a mental hospital and how I've been "diagnosed" with different "mental disorders". Luckily, I have not been diagnosed with any mental disorders.
I was "allowed" to see some regular doctors to investigate my digestive issues, but the insurance was cancelled (without telling me) so I racked up some medical debt. I never received an apology. Yet still, to this day, she offers to pay for health insurance for psychiatrists and she won't give up...
I am just now starting to stop listening to the opinions of others (what led me to be misled in the first place). I am starting to stand up for myself and not let people walk all over me. I am starting to speak my opinions and be happy and feel like a dignified human instead of someone weak, sick, "crazy", and unworthy to live.
Just know that the reason why they hate you so much is because you threaten them just by existing. I have strengths these people don't have and they are jealous to a degree. It's a big compliment, in a way.
I'm not saying it's a good thing. A sane, supportive family is preferable.                
                                            
                        I just want the sweet man I met back!!! We have been together for 11 years and things didn't start going to s*** until we got married 3 years ago. Most of the time he's the same sweet person from before. About every 6 months he gets way to drunk and goes ape s***. Breaking things and yelling at me. (that's not all but that is all I am ready to share for now) Sometime we're fighting and sometimes it's just out of no where. It's like Jekyll and Hyde! Afterward he will say he'll quit drinking and then be drinking the next day. I know we CAN both quit drinking if we really want b/c we did it for lent this year! I really hope this is private b/c I am still with him and we are both trying to make this work. I just want it to get better bc I am a nervous wreck. I love him but I also love myself. I've told him I will do what is necessary for me and he's surprisingly good with that. But for now we are still trying..                
                                            
                        I want to forget... I want to forget everything. I want to start over... but I can't. Do I have to live with it for the rest of my life? I don't want to. The pain is crippling me. I can't function. 
I'm afraid of my own Mother. I know what she is capable of. It scares me. The beatings hurt... but the words she screamed at me constantly hurt even more. I'm too afraid to go downstairs. I'm too afraid to speak to her. 
How can I trust anyone else if I don't even trust my 'family'?
I have no family... I am alone...
                                            
                                        
                                            
                        How long does it take to get over emotional abuse...decades of it. Ugh. I'm sad tonight.                
                                            
                        I remember taking one of my moms ciggs when I was about seven, my friends and I would run out to our fort and act like we were inhaling, thought we were cool. Then as I got older I really got addicted. I smoked several packs a day for a while, then I would cut back. Every time telling myself that I was gonna quit. This went on for several years. Finally I was down to a pack every ten days or so. This last year has been rough for me, but I am finally able to say for the last ten days I am smoke free!!!!! Hopefully no more ever again.                
                                            
                        I am sick and tired of coughing constantly, my house smelling like smoke, and my husband not wanting to kiss me.  I also douse myself with perfume right before work everyday to cover up the smell of smoke.   Its only been six hours so far, but I really want to do this.                
                                            
                        Well here it goes i met my husband two years ago and we have been married one year. My husband is addicted to pain pills and i have tried to help him but two weeks ago he admitted he is doing heroin and meth also. He told his boss about it and they gave him a couple weeks off to try amd get clean we went thru the withdrawals and it was heartbreaking watching it the first week the second week he seem to being doing good now that he is back at work he is using again and telling me that he has to quit slowly.we have fought every night and i have made him leave he is staying with friends. He is on the verge of losing him job cuz his boss said they are going to give him a drug test and if he fails they are firing him on the spot. I love him so much he is going to counseling but i feel like i should be supporting him more of trying to quit but how do u help someone who keeps lying and using? I just feel so lost and scared for him i dont know what to do. Any advice please???
                                            
                        So last year I started self harming after a number of events and gradually became an addict. Those of you who are familiar with self harm know how extremely addictive it is when you start and when you want to stop, it's really hard. I managed to stop once but only for a few weeks and started doing it again but not as much as I had before. Then I stopped again. But last night, my progress was ruined. I started doing it again but worse that it used to be. It seems like things are different now because deep down, I'm ashamed of it, when I used to be proud of it. Proud that I was still here despite everything. I guess I'm just ashamed because I'm a victim of addiction.

                        At one stage of my life, I was pretty anti-smoking, but like some of those people, I caved in and begun smoking. The desire to start became too much.
I've social smoked several times over the last few years, usually with a drink on nights out, but I started properly a few months ago. I only smoke five a day on average, occasionally more if I'm badly stressed or anxious. And it's a massive help and makes me feel more relaxed and calm. I prefer to keep the amount down, partly for financial reasons, but more because I prefer the pleasure a few times a day. :)
Thankfully, as of yet I'm not addicted, but I know it's something I'm risking. But yeah, no regrets, I consider myself a smoker now.                
                                            
                        I'm not a heavy smoker by any means,  I only really smoke 5 a day at the most, unless I'm particularly anxious and/or stressed. But I'm glad I started, when I light up I just feel the stress and anxiety melt away.

It has definitely helped me get through my anxiety. :)  and every time I light up, it's a nice little pleasure.                
                                            
                        He is more physically abusive to me. first it was emotional and i realize that because i was diagnosed with depression after i began dating him.but now its weird, sometimes i wonder if he is doing these things on purpose so he can push me away so i will leave him.. he chokes me with my long hair as a joke asking if i can breathe, he says " stop breathing" but then laughs as a joke. he sometimes flinches at me with a fist, he throws me on the bed, nudges my face with a slap, and this is all done as a joke. but sometimes i wonder if he is joking. he says he hates women but says it sarcastically. but he says he loves me. and he talks about our future. but then he also asked me if i would be angry if he was in control of the money when we live together for a couple of years so we can save up, which means no dates. 
i love him but this is not what i want, and i find it VERY VERY difficult to leave him. i am attached to him.
we spent all day yesterday together , and today he asked if i could come over but i told him i was "babysitting" if i told him i didnt want to and i have things to do he would take it personally. so im not seeing him today, i used to love seeing him everyday and i would also always want to see him everyday but i dont find it as hard to spend a day apart from him, i actually like it. i actually can have one day where i dont feel made fun of or pushed around.
i need advice. dont tell him to leave him right away because i am already detaching myself from him. i just need advice on how to cope                
                                            
                        Sometimes it is nice to have someone around and near.  Just to be there.                
                                            
                        So the other night my internet ran out, I'd just had time to download some music to use up the last of the data allowance before the time ran out. Unfortunately the album I downloaded (as a single track) has some real clangers on it, so now I'll have to download the decent tunes as separate tracks. Then after the internet got cut off I was very lonely. I couldn't go on EP or forums and just browse to kill the time. I wished I had spent more time talking with someone, like been on Skype or something. I haven't had a Skype conversation in months actually. I realised no one I know or have ever met irl has tried to contact me in the past several weeks, on Skype, e-mail, EP, phone, text, anything. I'm actually afraid to try to contact them now as I don't want to be a bother or to intrude. I'm afraid of my attempts to get back in touch being unwelcome. Then a song came on that is a good song (one of only a few on that album I downloaded) but really isn't good for me because it expresses some feelings that I try to keep buried and hidden from myself because they just hurt so much. Then the electricity shut off and it was dark and very quiet, so I went to bed and cried and wished someone would be there and hold me, or that someone would even want to be. I thought about how awfully afraid I am that I'll always be alone in the cold and dark and no one wants me around, and I can't tell anyone because then they'll feel pressured and feel like I'm guilt-tripping them into spending time with me when they don't want to. I don't want someone to spend their time with me if that's not something they want for themselves. I don't want them to be burdened and I don't want them to feel stuck with me; so it's best to keep my loneliness to myself and just hope that they miss me sometimes and maybe someone will contact me. They probably moved on and found another friend and forgot me and want to spend their time with that person instead, and there's nothing I can do about that, and certainly begging them to spend time with me because I'm hurting isn't going to make them feel good.. so idk, I think I'll just wait it out. If anyone does decide to get in contact again then I'll just try to appear positive so as not to scare them off with my depression (even though that goes away when I'm with a friend, I don't want them to feel obligated or stuck because of that). Anyway, who knows, maybe I'll find a new friend to spend time with, who I can actually be open with about.. That would be a f'king (second) miracle though lol. >_>
                                            
                        Well my boyfriend left for Marines bootcamp 26 days ago... I'm not as destroyed as I thought I'd be. i guess i just accepted that he's gone and this is for the best, this is his dream so I gotta stay strong accept it and just wait. I've been with him since 11/20/2010. So he is definitely my forever. His letters put a smile on my face. So far I've gotten 3. He said it's pretty brutal and annoying. But he's excited to go up to pendelton and shoot guns and stuff(: In one of his letters he said he has a surprise for me when i see him next, I'm thinking maybe he'll propose??? OMG I'd be so happy, however I have no idea how he'd pull it off since he didn't have that much money before bootcamp, and he couldn't bring a ring with him to bootcamp. However I think that's what it is i could be totally wrong but I know he wants to be with me forever. Ahhh i love him soo much. I think about him ALL THE TIME. He's the best guy I could ever of asked for, I'm the luckiest girl in the world. I pray the time goes by fast and that he's safe and will kick asssss. Anyway that's my update, (:                
                                            
                        I spend all my time in my room, no one to talk to. I have a phone that is really useless cause no one texts, calls or chat to me. 
So I just siting waiting for someone to talk to me cause I feel like people don't know I am alive or something.                
                                            
                        I don't know why I almost always feel lonely. I have a nice caring family, though I'm studying in another city and I stay in a single room in my college hostel.. But even back then when I stayed with them I felt lonely.. I can't remember a time when I didn't feel this way. I have a boyfriend and he really loves me and cares about me.. But sometimes I feel he doesn't really care much 'cause on few nights he'd sleep off leaving me awake.. Though that's pretty rare.. I want to know why I feel sad and lonely all the time?
I'm happy too, when I'm with my close friends I joke and talk and laugh a lot.. Even when I am with my guy I talk a lot and people who don't know me that closely actually think I'm a very lively person. And my close friends say I'm a "happily sad person". But when I'm by myself, I feel like i'm the loneliest person in the world.. I feel something is missing, I don't know what it is but it makes me feel very sad and incomplete.. Durinf day time I have classes so that keeps me busy.. But at night, I feel very lonely.. I don't want to live.. I often wonder what I'm living for.. And I also contemplated suicide but always drop the idea cause I know my family can't live without me... I used to cut earlier but now it's been like 2 years since I stopped due to a promise..
Why do I feel this way? Am I suffering from depression or I'm just sad? I'm fine when I'm around people who I like.. But when I'm alone I feel very sad.. 
Back in school I had nice friends, but here in college I don't find good friends and have really few friends.. Though I ain't a boring person, I'm actually fun loving but the people here are really different..
I always think about the past, the time when I was a kid and lived a happy life, miss my grandparents who I was really attached to, miss my city, and most of all my school.. I miss the old way of life.. And the sad part is that's gone forever.. 
I don't get sleep at night either, I just lie awake with all these thoughts running in my head and often end up crying for hours, sometimes I know the reason and sometimes I don't..
Tired of living this kinda life.. I wish I get a friend to talk to..                
                                            
                        a boy sent me a message on this, saying this "help me" then moments later he sent another message saying "I'm killing myself, bye" 
I only got this message there now. I was at my dads house whenever he sent me this message. this is all my fault, I could of saved him, but I didn't. I didn't reply to him. I didn't even have my phone with me. I literally killed someone who I could of saved. I didn't even know his name. I didn't know his story. I didn't even know who he was to pray for him. I'm such a horrible person, I will never forgive myself for this. rip the boy with no name </3                
                                            
                        I need someone to talk too , I'm really lonely at this point and nobody's really been there for me and i just... Need someone to talk too.                
                                            
                        Who hasn't ? Perfection shouldn't even be considered a word .                
                                            
                        I'm sending this out to the one place that i know it can get lost, somewhere in cyberspace. Somewhere where my words can't hurt anyone and have no consequences. Everyday i wake up hoping it was just a nightmare. Just this sick twisted horrible thing that i read somewhere else in the world... just not my world.  But it's  not. It's not a nightmare, its our life. 
 I hate the one man in my life that i knew to be my hero, my rock. The man who took my hand and told me that everything was going to be ok. The man who told me that i can do anything I put my mind to. I trusted you with my most precious possessions in this entire world. And like a snake you preyed on them. You stole her innocence and I can never give that back to her, ever. But I can make a promise that i will do whatever it takes to make sure you pay for what you did, one way or another. 
I know that I failed as a mother to protect her. And I know that it will take a very long time before she can ever forgive me for that but I do pray everyday that she will at some point. I love my baby very much, no matter how much she shuts me out. She is a part of my heart that i need, that makes me whole.                
                                            
                        I regret having to work so hard.
I regret not being able to say I love you.
I regret ever being in love.
I regret giving up my life for the pursuit of money.
I regret being such a coward.
I regret losing all my friends.
I regret making friends in the first place.
I regret being such a loser.
I regret trying to make myself happy. 
I regret having hope.
but mostly I regret ever being born.                
                                            
                        hello i am a 43 year old male who has lived with my mother in london all this time. i dont have many friends, i am a loser with women,i have not had a Girlfriend in 7 years. i dont have a social life at all.
i just stay in my room on my computer.
My Mom is 63 years old she is getting no younger, she told me i had to go and make a life for myself.
she is moving out of our place , so i reluctantly found a flat somewhere.
Look i hate it, im not domesticated at all, i lived with my Mother for too long, i dont know how to do stuff
and i am so lonely, it is horrible. i dont know anybody where i have moved to, have i made a mistake?
my depression is really bad, i have no friends , im just sad and lonely, i am feeling so much pressure.
                                            
                        I cant. I'm too young, no money, no place to run to. I just want out of here. Theres got to be a way                
                                            
                        I have thought about running away often but lately I have realized it would not change a thing. I think I just want to be someone else. I have allowed people to walk all over me my whole life. I try to make everyone happy. I think if I were to run away and start over I would be stronger and more independent. I have given my dependence away and now I have nothing. If I were to leave I would still be the same person tho. I would just be in a different place. After all I cannot run away from me.                
                                            
                        I went to my best friend's birthday party last night and didn't really know the people who were having it for him. Well, being the self conscious person I've turned into, I was apprehensive about going anyway. I just wanted everything to go smoothly and at first it did. Until the liquor started flowing. I wanted to "loosen up" because I felt really anxious and nervous anyway. Well, I had too many vodka and waters and got absolutely obliterated. My friend told me I started making ethnic jokes and just overall being a nutcase. I feel so horrible and even called the guy whose house it was and apologized on his voice mail. He never answered not that I expected him to, but my friend said all was forgiven he talked to him. My problem is this is a reoccurring theme in my life. I always seem to be funny and cool enough to make people like me. At first. Then I somehow ruin everything and end up being the guy people hate. I know alcohol and drugs make people do things they regret but I think my social anxiety has made it impossible for me to have normal, healthy relationships in my life. I feel so sad today and now I'm going to bed hating myself again.                
                                            
                        And it came at a huge cost. i ask myself everyday since why i was so stupid.                
                                            
                        Well, everything's gone to pieces.
My   came into my room and got on my laptop.
My room is my space and sanctuary, you can only come in if I let you and that is really important to me and so far I've trusted that she wouldn't, she's my twin and we each need our own space.
But I guess a left my laptop up and running and Gael (my sister) decided to look through my most viewed sites and she saw EP.
But not my EP, thank god, but Sam's EP. Sam's EP filled with everything she tries to hide about the world, about herself, about her demons. 
I check it every so often to make sure she's "okay" and the computer wasn't loading so I left it up to go to the bathroom and when I came back she was reading everything.
So now she knows, my sweet, lovely, innocent, sister knows and I feel like I've been stabbed in the chest. Gael shouldn't have to know, her heart shouldn't have to break every time she see's Sam's wrists. Gael thought they were just cat scratches and from shaving, she didn't even suspect.
Gael texted her friend "Ava" who told her friend, who told his friend, who told her mother, who told my mother, who is going to call Sam's mother and I'm sitting in my room shaking because I don't know what to do.
Sam's been on medication for years but life has always been a struggle for her. She wouldn't want anyone to know and now everyone knows
I've broken all the walls and glass that I've been carefully building around everyone for the past three years and I am so lost.
Sam doesn't know, I know, Sam doesn't know I've been picking up the pieces for years and when this all hits the fan I don't think I'm going to be able to fix it.                
                                            
                        How many stupid mistakes I made in 17 months?!
I am such a miserable oaf. Small minded miserable oaf.                
                                            
                        I once lies to my wonderful small group leaders! I said I prayed for my old friends uncle to be healthy but I didn't! I cannot believe I even shared that! They actually believed me too.                
                                            
                        I have to say there are lots of mistakes I have made big and small, I regret them so much, especially one, sometimes it hurts. At the end of the day I can't go back an change my mistakes but I can try and learn from them and in the future make a better job of it, or at least try. No matter how much I get judged in my mistakes and I know I do, I'm the one who has to live with it, not people who judge me, and you should never judge someone until you have walked around in their shoes. It's not fair. Life isn't fair, but if we keep our chin up and stay hopeful, things tend to look up.  Learn from your mistakes don't dwell on them too much

                        My boyfriend has been in there for 8 months now. I miss him soo much they want to charge him for murder that happened years ago they have no proof it was him but just because someone said his name but I believe in his innocence :(                
                                            
                        I shared my thoughts earlier on another group page. I still don't know how this site is figured...but it feels great to get some thoughts out that have been in my mind for years. My best friend is the only one who knows how I feel about my marriage. My husband travels for work. He is gone most of the year living out of our camper. I do understand this may be lonely for him. However, I do not understand how he can go out to get, "a burger and beer" and not end up calling me the rest of the night. Then I get a random text at 5am that states, "Love you". That to me says guilty all over it. The past ten years with this man has been really hard. I keep telling myself it will get better, and I allow him to pacify me like a child when he comes home. We have two small children, whom of which I am raising alone, and he has come to the point where he is just taking me for granted. I am not an ignorant person. I have a Masters Degree and feel like I have never been blinded by ones ill nature...yet, with my husband I know I am. He thinks that I should be okay with him out playing pool and drinking beers, while I'm home changing diapers and breaking up fights. I feel like a change is coming. The strong, self sufficient woman that I use to be is knocking louder and louder at my door. He is on his way home tonight, for 48 hours and I am dreading it! If it was not for my kids I would have been out of here a long time ago. He makes me feel my feelings don't matter. Its a real bummer. Should I stick for the kids? Sometimes I feel like I'm in a jail and I have time to do until they turn 18. My youngest is 2...so I have a LOT of time! Wow, that feels good to get out! Can't wait for this weekend to be OVER and he can be back at the bars and I can be back at the gym. Total bummer!                
                                            
                        Last year My MM got a piece of metal stuck in his eye. He went to emergency and they tried to get it out but couldn't. He was in pain, frustrated and in tears when he called me. Emergency had made him an appointment with a specialist but he was ready to give up. 
I asked him if he wanted me to go with him. Because that is what it felt like, but he sounded reluctant to outright ask. (neither one of us is very good at asking for help). He said, Yes. 
So, he came to get me and together we went to the eye dr. We sat and waited side by side, my arm across his shoulders and him rubbing my leg. It was a long wait because they squeezed him in. 
I asked him later why he wanted me with him. He said, Because I knew you would get me through it. I wanted to just give up after they tried and failed in emergency. Plus, I really wanted to see you. 
They patched his eye after they got it out so I needed to drive back to my place and he drove the last 15 minutes back home. To this day, no one has any idea he even went to the specialist. They all think it was taken out in the emergency room that day. 
We have history that is ours and ours alone.                
                                            
                        My boyfriend and I are very serious. We have been in a four year relationship and we are getting ready to go down the marriage path. I love him so much. 
But, recently things have been very heated. We've had a couple large arguments which aren't completely rare, but these have be rather different. On Monday night we got in an argument that was over something stupid but it got big very quickly. As I left his house I realized I wanted to apologize and so I honked my horn and yelled for him before he went inside. He stopped, then continued to go inside. 
When I got home he ignored my texts. Because I thought he needed space I left him alone. Finally a day later I messaged him, he responded saying he needed space. Well he took his sweet time and didn't talk to me until this morning. I was livid. I waited for three days not knowing if he wanted to talk it out or hang out. So I wasted all that time. Then he says, "do you want to talk tonight, if not I already have plans." Grrrrr. 
So I flipped out and we got in a hot old argument. And in this argument i admitted that I resented him. It feel like I have sacrificed so much for our relationship (i.e. not going to the college I wanted, coming home early from my abroad trip, losing some friendships, and losing myself in the process) I ended up telling him I was unhappy and I hate my life right now--its all dependent on him. Which I would be fine with, if he put out the effort to. 
Arg he has given up nothing, I have helped him get the career he wanted. I have helped him move into the place he is in through my connections (and he loves it) Its like he is getting more than his ambitions, but I am getting none of mine. 
                                            
                        Ugggg I have had it.. He lies to me constantly all through our marriage.. He tells me he's going to the gas station or the store he ends up not coming back turning off his phone.. Till like 3 in the morning.. And me he tells me he might get fired this if the 3 rd job in 2 yrs he will have list if he gets fired.. I'm ready to blow and it won't be pretty..                
                                            
                        I was laying in bed this morning (Saturday) wearing his shirt he gave me and reading parts of "A guide to surviving life as a mistress" trying to figure out where my MM fits in.
My phone was in the other room, I heard his the text message tone that I assigned just to him. We never contact each other on the weekend, I guess it's the un written rule of being the OW. It was a smiley face.
Being on the cautious side I sent back "Hi" who know if it's him or not. It was him, I think the time we spent together on Friday really had an impact on him. Can't help but smile about that and as much as I love that he contacted me, should I tell him no weekend contact, I just think it's very risky.                
                                            
                        I am very paranoid. I always feel like people are going to do something against me. My friends are going to betray me. People are always out to get me. I try to stop and trust people but at the end of the day, that thought stays. What's worse is that at times, when I think that I shouldn't trust that person, they'll do something against me, it turns out to be true.                
                                            
                        My boyfriend has been at basic for a few weeks now and time is flying by. I miss him a lot but everyday gets a little easier because every day is another day closer to when I get to see him again. I have a few questions about what he will be doing for the holidays since he will be there for thanksgiving and Christmas. Do they train that day or get the day off? Will he be able to call home on those days? 
As for my questions about graduation, will I be able to kiss him after I tap him out? I have read the PDA rules are very strict, no holding hands etc. Just wondering if there is any exception to when you get to tap them out. Is a hug and a quick kiss okay? 
If anyone has any answers to these questions it would be greatly appreciated :)                
                                            
                        So my husband took a new job in a new city and I supported that because it was what he wanted and what he dreamed of for a long time, to head an academic program at a university.  I am a consultant and I can do my job no matter where I am.  I wanted him to be happy.
But I am not sure if he is capable of being happy.  As most narcissists, he is not capable of seeing any of his own shortcomings.  So, when the inevitable roadbumps  emerge as would be present in any new job scenario, who do you think is blamed?  Certainly not my husband who perceives none of his own flaws.
In addition, it would be difficult to imagine how I could be culpable for problems in his assimilation to his new job, but somehow I am.  I am not supportive enough, I don't network enough, I should be out in the community trying to win business in this new city (even though I have enough to keep me busy).  And the list goes on.  
Tonight he tells me I am not grateful enough and appreciative enough for him, and I wear him out.  Oh.  Really?  He used the "F" word about a dozen times tonight.  Always aimed at me.  
He has told me repeatedly that he thinks I am not earning my potential, and well he cannot earn more because he is in academia where there are limitations to his earning potential.  I try to tell my self that these things are part and parcel of the pressures of changing jobs, but it seems that his mind is a bit warped.  He is always the injured party.  He is so precious, so fragile, that must be why he swears and uses abusive language, to even what is obviously a disparate power balance.
It makes no sense, if he was an academic, a teacher, a powerful and influential mind, why not persuade or construct a logical narrative to convince me to his way of thinking, why stoop to intimidation, shouting and profanity to make me back down from my position.  There is only one reason.  He cannot meet me on this level, and his tactics are the only ones he has.  It makes me sad.
He takes his turns.  He always finds fault.  Last week I don't make enough money.  This week I am not appreciative enough of his lavish spending.  Next week who knows.  His logic defies me.  If he is worried about money why does he buy things we don't need?  Why is it my fault when I ask the question?  Oh yes because I don't automatically worship anything that he does, including spending money for things we don't need.  This is the narcissist.                
                                            
                        Been clean for over a year.

                        I started doing drugs when I was 14. I used to do just marijuana sporadically because my friends pressured me into it. Then a guy I was extremely close to passed away, and I decided to try drugs to see if it helped with the pain. And it did for a while. I tried pills and cocaine at first, but then as time went on I started to do heroin. At 16, I remember I couldn't go a day without doing heroin or else I would be physically incapable of doing anything. I started doing bad in school and lost some friends, all the while I was in a depression from the loss of my friend. Thankfully I met another guy who I started to date, so the happiness from that greatly cut me back on the drug use. I quit cold turkey one day, became pregnant a short while later, and since I was pregnant that gave me the motivation to stay sober. I get cravings every now and then but my son is what keeps me going and sober.                
                                            
                        It seems like every other story here is about people who had their lives nearly ruined by drug abuse. I still use drugs occasionally, but responsibly, and I've never run up against a problem.
Granted, I'm not using the kinds of drugs mostly talked about here. I've never touched meth, heroin, or crack, nor do I plan to. None of them interest me. Coke is too short-lived in my opinion (thirty minutes or so. Not worth it). But I regularly use weed, MDMA (molly), LSD, and psilocybin mushrooms. I have also used DMT and some research chemicals, but these are rare occurrences. I don't use molly more than once a month (usually less than that because it's expensive), because the main neurotransmitter it works with is serotonin, not dopamine, and it takes a long time to replenish itself. LSD and mushrooms are my favorites and I don't take either more than once every two weeks. They're among the safest drugs I do but it's important to space out trips a fair amount of time so as to let what you've learned on them solidify, and to respect the powerful substances. I smoke weed whenever it's around. If I have money to buy my own supply, I usually end up smoking every day.
I learn a lot from the drugs I do. Drugs that don't seem to teach me much are the ones I tend to avoid. For example, I'll drink every once in a great while as a social activity, but I generally dislike alcohol. The drugs I do tend to clear my head more than clouding it, so that I can reevaluate my life and think about what's happening around me. Nine times out of ten, what I realize while on drugs reaffirms that sobriety is my favorite state of mind.
I have a job. I pay rent. I go to college and I'm very intelligent. I also happen to do drugs. I think they can be very mind-opening if you go into it with a respect for yourself and the substance you're using, if you educate yourself on what you're putting into your body and what precautions to take, and if you are able to set hard lines for yourself. I love drugs but if I don't have the money or I feel like I haven't been sober often enough, I don't do them and it's that simple.                
                                            
                        I had my first cone when I was 9 thanks to my babysitter. I didn't start smoking on a regular basis until I was 14. When I was 15 through to 17 I did phamarceuticals every day. Mostly mild opiates and benzodiazepine tranquillisers. Half the time I didn't know what I was taking or how much I was taking. I overdose about 3 times. Between 17 and 18 I use to go to raves and take ecstasy every weekend. When I was 20 and 21 I did acid twice a week. Between 18 and 21 I was addicted to speed (amphetamine sulphate not meth). I use to do speed 2 days In a row and take the third day off which when I was 20 and 21, I used that day off to do acid. I hated being addicted to it and it was very hard to quit, it took me a year to quit. Speed didn't really cause me many problems though because the come down was clean I could still work or even work high. Though I stopped going to my Tafe classes to do drugs and I chose to do drugs over hanging out with my friends. Tafe was ok though because I would show up on the last day and get notes for the exam and still pass. By the time I was 21 I was pretty much constantly skattered. I use to say random things like glitter scissors and I got nicknamed space cadet. I think it was combination of weed, speed and acid all the time that did it. I wanted to go to Uni and do science but I needed a brain and I knew if I kept going like that I wouldn't much of one. So I quit all drugs. I only regret quitting acid. I don't do drugs any more but I still don't dislike them. I know I can never touch speed again because I'll be straight on it again. I still get cravings for it 4 yrs later.                
                                            
                        I started doing Meth when I was 18 years old, my daughter was only two months old and her daddy practically made me do it, he like to hit me so I just did what he wanted and tried it. Big big mistake I started doing it all the time. So I blamed him for my new addiction and when he got locked up I felt like that was my chance to finally leave him. I did...got with Jeremy and stayed clean for over two years! Well Jeremy was the love of my life, I got pregnant by him and maybe two weeks after finding out I was expecting....Jeremy goes to jail for armed robbery, interfearince with a 911 call etc. So I got all stressed out couldn't eat or anything even though I tried really hard cause of my baby inside of me. What happens next well my stomach is hurting so bad I go to the emergency room to find out of miscarried.....Jeremy goes to court gets a 20 do 10 to the door and my world had came crashing down all around me! So I keep working my job stressed out the total Max limit and I turn to my old addiction Meth....I was just doing it every weekend, then it turned to every other day, to every day all day. So for the next couple years I am strung out so bad I quit my job, lost my car, lost my home, my family, EVERYTHING!! Well 7 months ago I decided I didn't wanna live like that nomore and it was time to turn my life around. So I have and I couldn't be any happier. I got my daughter back now, getting a car today actually my family is back in my life now and I will never do Meth again. It's the devil and all it will do is eat ur life away to where there is nothing left. So if u ain't never done it don't all it takes is that one hit. If ur like me and staying clean keep staying clean if I can do it anybody can.                
                                            
                        So I met this girl and we started going out (not as dates) We fooled around, laughed, did everything you could like to do with anyone. She used to tell me about all her life, problems with her family, some lost friendships.... Oh and boyfriends; she always speak to me for advice about boyfriends she told me about all her crushes and stuff. 
Pretty much I was sure she only wanted me as a friend until one day her brother wich was boyfriend of my girl twin came to my house to dinner with us and he told me he had a surprise to me, it was her! She looked so beatiful I couldn't stop starin at her. Anyway so we had dinner and my twin with her boyfriend went somewhere else and left me and her alone at the living room. We didn't have any kind of awkward moment since we had so much confidence to each other, so i layed down at the coach and she came and lay over my chest and we simply kept speaking. I had my hand a side of my body when she told me "put it on the back if my neck, its more confortable" I was just stunned! For once in my life I thought My crushed loved me back! So that night went all perfect until the next week. We had a party so i decided to go there and be honest about my feelings to her but she friendzoned me. I felt a deeo hole on my chest, I was shocked I guess broken heart. 
After that party our releationship disapeared, we didn't spoke to eachother anymore until like 3 weeks later she sent me a message telling me she was going to date someone else and that she wished the best for me. The worst part it was some guy she never told me about.
All that happened I think year ago. Three weeks ago she messaged me like if nothing happened. I followed her since I really wanted to speak with her about anythin. . .
So I don't know what to espect, if she actually feels somethin or if she thinks im destroyed thanks to her rejection (wich is basically true) or if she just want to be friends. And I mean i would love to be friends of her again but i dont know if in ready to be it and watch her with another guy...
I would appreciate any advice. Or comment 
PS: sorry if theres not much cohesion Im not that good at english                
                                            
                        Totally betrayed by a man I was completely committed and devoted to only to find out he  was never faithful, I feel like he stole my life and it's not fair! 28 yrs of my life a lie, so y can't I just say see ya! I'm sure this is so old to most of u but I'm really havin a hard time                
                                            
                        Ok so here's my scoop; my   was pretty decent for bout 7 years then January is when stuff started going sour.   The wife didn't feel connected but more trapped, I never noticed (other than it being sexless). Then she decided to leave me!   Long story short divorce should be finalized soon, but my heart is do damaged upon repair,   Not sure what to do?                
                                            
                        It's a messed up world we live in                
                                            
                        It was my hardest situation in life when my wedding was cancelled the last minute. It happened to me twice. 
First in 2010, my fiance called it off a few weeks before my wedding. He dumped me without any reason. 
I was shocked and completely taken off guard. Apparently he had been thinking about it for some time and the wedding was really stressing him out and he just wasn't sure what he wanted it anymore. I noticed that, but still I pretended to be fine  as everything had been prepared.I didn't want to upset my family, relatives and friends.
In the ensuing days I isolated myself from everyone that might ask me "how are the wedding plans going?" or "when's the big day?". To make matters worse, every time I open my email, my friends updated me about their flight details for attending my wedding. I seriously cannot cope the pressure anymore. Tears ran down my face while replying their emails. I did my best to explain and said sorry.
When I reached that dead end, I was by myself. I locked myself in my room. I deactivated my FB account as the announcement of our wedding has been made to our friends. My heart was terribly broken seeing my family member in tears. I just cannot coped with the pressure anymore. I decided to travel alone to marvel myself the following year.
In my solitude, I began searching online friends for encouragement. I thought perhaps there were others out there who shared the same experience. Surely I couldn't be the only person who suffered this devastation. While browsing through the net to meet new people,  I met someone who really cared for me and we fell in love. He came to see me and we decided to get married.
And alas AGAIN  - My second wedding got called off few hours before a wedding date was even set. My parents decided to stop  the wedding as they knew something fishy was going on. They  turned the ceremony into "unwanted" engagement. As everything has been prepared, the ceremony has to go on no matter what.  I won't go into depths, but the incident was much harder to get out of, as I feared what everyone would think. I thought, "What's wrong with me? Why did it happen again? Everyone blamed me, I feel demotivated. I moved out from the house.
I impulsively ran away to another place, without leaving a note for my family because I was too stressed and too humiliated to be around family and friends.  I figured I would be better off if I stayed away for a while where no one knew who I was or what my relationship status was. I was totally MIA for years, not even on the net. 
My second engagement ended this past September, and although it was amazingly tough and very complicated. I finally found out the truth about my fiance. His dishonest really upset me. He is married man with many kids and  two wives. He is not single as he confessed when we were in a relationship. 
I just had enough all the drama he made and finally i left! 
All this to say that cancelling a wedding is definitely not easy but it isn't the end of the world either.  I have no idea what the future holds for me  but I do know that we were not meant to be married. Something happens for a reason.
To all singles out there, don't get rush into marriage just because of your long period of single life. True love will come eventually. Just enjoy your single life! Age is only a figure.                
                                            
                        I broke up with the   of my life last week... I knew that we are not going to have any future together so I just ended it . I dont knw if it is a good decision or not but I'm really broken... I did it because it is a hopeless relationship. .. I just miss him . I feel so sad..                
                                            
                        You broke my heart like you were paid to, mission complete. I have had MY life ripped from me to make me this way. If you doubt it, go back check the tapes. They should be in the office where you work. 
Everytime you found me did I not show you kindness? No matter who we were did I not always show you respect? Tortured for you. Never speaking your name. Always faithful. To anyone I ever loved. Rome?
Was it really so far fetched to think you could ever feel the same? Over again, and again you left me in the ruins. Only you could wake me. Only you could break me. Only you could shatter me. Again leaving me reaching for a beautiful city you have taken anyone who is not me. Sail.
                                            
                        I still cannot make sense of what we had. We couldn't let go of each other. I left you many times, you left me once. Still, most of the time, you came back, you wanted to see me, be with me again. You told me countless times you love me and you showed that too. We had wonderful moments together over these almost 2 years.
But why, why, why did you push me away from time to time???? It hurt me so much every single time and it triggered me to push you away too. And you would end up very hurt as well.
I wrote you a long letter once telling you all of this but you never really gave me a real explanation. I know there is a gap between us and we are in different phases of our lives. But come on!!! This is real love, love that happens, if we are lucky, once or twice in a lifetime. Shouldn't it be about acceptance?
However, can I really blame you? I never told you openly without reservations what I really wanted, how I was really feeling. I was always trying to manipulate the situation, to become less vulnerable, more on top of my game. You, on the other hand, didn't make it easier either for me to feel safe with you.
So I guess, I will never know if you really wanted me, even if you loved me deeply.                
                                            
                        If you never of had a broken heart, it's the worst feeling ever. Me and my ex haven't been together for almost a year. Yes I've moved on and don't think about him everyday. But when I do I just wanna call him. Text him. Be with him. 
The worst part is a couple weeks after breaking up he got a new girlfriend. We were together a long time. Having no idea he was talking someone the whole end of our relationship. I still don't have answers from our relationship and I guess you can say I'm still holding on to that. Each day it gets easier and easier. But I still miss him like crazy..                
                                            
                        We met first of all by a new friend of mine called 
But, then he just told me that we're breaking up.
He said :
I was like WTF! Why the f*** didn't you tell her.
So, now we don't really talk that much . But, I will never forget him. He was the best boyfriend and person I've ever met.
I would'nt have met him without my new besto                 
                                            
                        I accidentally told my boyfriend of 7 months I loved him as I was saying bye. And he just said bye.... And left.                
                                            
                        We had a strong relation ship i have never let her be absit from me even 1hr. How i got to know she cheated, she always talk about him and by the time she said they were in relation but they broke and she is with me now. Then my best friend didn't tell me about her before   When he was with her he never show me or tell me. He used to say he is single. Anyway after i got to be her boyfriend he stepped up   To me and say everything that he was with her in relationship and he used to love her but not anymore. So am in the safe said that he is not thinking about her anymore and she said the same. But i have never trust that. After 11 months she stepped to me and said i have never forget him. And he steeped to me and said the same. How bad is that. You know guys how is it feel when you be the one   In the meddle. I have loved her so much than myself and giving her everything even when i cant i give. I felt that i was nothing to her. Now she said i cant leave with out u and trying to get me back. I cant forgive her and i pray for her to be in situation same as mine. To feel me.                
                                            
                        I was with my boyfriend for almost 2 years.
We fought to be together.
I supported him fully on his decision to join the army and when he did I was faithful. I wrote him every single day and always made sure he heard from home.
The week before my grandma passed, I got a message from one of the girls and she told me everything.
He had been cheating on me with 2 girls back home for the entire length of our relationship.
When I confronted him he lied. I told him if he didn't tell me the truth I'd leave.
He confessed everything. Not only did he have a relationship with these 2 girls but he slept with 3 other girls while stationed on ba
                                            
                        And I am happier, more productive, engaged with life, compassionate, generous, effective, and competent than I have ever been.  Everyone who knows me would agree with this, too.  Not all illegal drugs are bad for everyone and many are badly hurt by their illegality.  I lost 25 years.                
                                            
                        I've always been very open to experiences. Drugs are no exception. I'm a very curious individual. I'm no stranger to drug  experimentation. I've pretty much tried it all. I enjoy drugs. I enjoy being outside of my usual mind. But I wouldn't want to live everyday under the influence. I've never let it develop into an addiction. It wouldn't be fun anymore.
One substance stands out the most.. Methamphetamine. It makes me feel on top of the world. I'm a social butterfly with no self esteem issues. No anxieties. I'm beautiful when I'm speeding. It's like a block has been removed from my brain and I am who I was meant to be. No flaws. Its a wonderful experience each and every time. I love methamphetamine. Tweaking is my paradise.
On that note, I do not think that everyone should try it. I've seen it ruin lives. I've seen it ruin faces. I am lucky enough to be part of the minority that doesn't over do it. Not that I'm above addiction.. I smoke a pack a day and I'm a total crab without my Newports. 
I just feel that recreational users get judged too harshly. People seem to think that if you do drugs you are automatically an addict and you need help. I'm living proof that those are false allegations. I take care of myself. I don't do drugs everyday. I don't blow all my money on it. And I have all of my teeth. It hasn't ruined my life. It's a guilty pleasure. We all have those. I'm not ashamed.                
                                            
                        meth really dug me into a hole. its hard, lonely, depressing for me now at this point. sober 2weeks. i regularly was using meth at age 14 to this point. where does one begin in life, with nothing.                
                                            
                        I enjoy self Harm cause it takes the pain away. I enjoy Self Harm cause its the only thing I can turn too. I enjoy self because its my drug. No one will ever understand what I'm going through, no one seems to care. The little razor blade I hold towards my vein seems to be my only cure now and forever.
