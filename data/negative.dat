-19	negative	bipolar-disorder	1 year and 2 months ago. It still feels like yesterday I guess time goes by fast. Next month would have been our fifth anniversary. He was my soulmate, THE ONE, my other half. He was my everything. And he died from an unknown reason. In aug 2012 he just collapsed and died, at 29 years old. No one knows why. I think about him every single day and I cry over him every single day. I am heart-broken, depressed and empty inside and it feels like I'm not actually living anymore. Like I'm just a body A zombie. The daily happiness, the joy, the bliss, the love I felt when I was with him is all gone. Now all that is left is the daily torture of knowing that I will never EVER see him again, I will never hear his voice again, I will never be able to hug him, nor kiss him, nor hold his hand. I love and miss him more than words can describe and I can't believe that I will live the rest of my life without him. My heart is aching every day - the torture is unbearable
-4	negative	bipolar-disorder	2nd Appointment. I sat there wondering if she realized that I'd beaten eight levels in Candy Crush since the hour started.
-11	negative	bipolar-disorder	2 years of being best friends completely wasted. I said a joke and she took it seriously. I tried explaining to her that it was a joke but she didn't care. She got really mean and I guess I didn't really know her. I changed and she didn't like the new me. I miss her a lot and I know if I apologize she will be really mean and defensive. I even swore on my life that i didnt mean what i said. I was bawling and cried for about 2 hours, and im pretty sure she didnt even shed a tear. I want to apologize but i know i shouldnt and even if i would she wouldnt care. What do I do?
-7	negative	bipolar-disorder	4 days after we met we were living together and within 3 months we were engaged. He was the love of my life, my soul mate and I knew from the moment I met him that I wanted to grow old with him.
-3	negative	bipolar-disorder	A battle raging on inside my head. Life starts to look so dead. Every building like a body on the field. Every door like a fallen bloody shield. Boom! The smell of cannon fire. Boom! The loss of all desire. Something inside of me; Kills everyone around. Though they cannot see, Because intent never makes a sound. Its over, done, and through; But everything Ive ever said is true. Weve all got a little demon, Theres even one inside of you.
-1	negative	bipolar-disorder	Absolutely! This is why there are serial killers
-4	negative	bipolar-disorder	A forty year friendship is something I cherish, and living this far away from him gets a bit much at times.   I'm just glad we talk every week.  If we didn't, I think i'd lose it.

-1	negative	bipolar-disorder	All my life i've been keeping my anger in for a long time and when people talk bad about me i shake it off but i still feel it in me im feeling more an more angry and it scares me to think what i might do i get thoughts of hurting  the people close to me like i hate anger i hate pain but when i hate more anger comes
-6	negative	bipolar-disorder	All Of My Issues(Part One)- First up is my paranoia: absolutely everything adds to my paranoia and makes it worse. Even the most irrational and stupid things. I'm constantly looking over my shoulder and holding my neck in my sleep. But the weird thing is, it's the things I love that make me paranoid. Things like gore and thoughts of people and what can be done to them. I make myself paranoid. I guess I'm just a hypocrite. I love these things being done to people, but I wouldn't want it to happen to me. Anyways, that's as far as in going into that.
-1	negative	bipolar-disorder	A lot of things I should've done in regards to having a career vs. a job.  Oh well, can only keep pushing on.
-3	negative	bipolar-disorder	Alright so I have a dark side. I love odd things. Seriously, I'm wearing a ouija board sweatshirt right now. I can't get talking about this because I'll go on and on!
-4	negative	bipolar-disorder	Although, I believe that no one is perfect, I'll be the first to admit that I have my flaws, maybe more than some people. But what matters is that I care about other people and try to think about their feelings/needs above my own.
-5	negative	bipolar-disorder	Am I the only one who feels as if something in their mind is soon going to snap and release the madness? Completely release it. Just letting go of any logical thinking you have left. And go insane. Not knowing anything besides the sadism. I'm going to snap soon. What about you?
-2	negative	bipolar-disorder	And I have cookies. Join me 
-3	negative	bipolar-disorder	and i honestly see nothing worth bragging about. too many people just think is cool, when in reality, if you where one, you would know how it gets in the way of you living. and the consequences.
-7	negative	bipolar-disorder	and i laugh as the blood oozes out of my wrist and onto the floor. the memory of you telling me to stop sends chills down my spine. it only makes me slice deeper and deeper. the memory of you.. it makes me cut deeper and deeper.. while i laugh harder and harder.
-1	negative	bipolar-disorder	And I'm good with it.  I have friends of both sexes and most of my needs are met. You can be single and not be alone or lonely.
-6	negative	bipolar-disorder	And it always made me feel sick to lie. I knew I would be caught in the end and if I wasn't then how could I be okay with myself for doing wrong and getting away with it so I know how some liars feel. I have lied and been lied to. I hate the feeling when I realize someone is not being honest with me its a mix of anger and sadness. I just think we all should work on being honest
-5	negative	bipolar-disorder	Anyone ever wonder? Why do we write these stories? I was thinking about this earlier today. After reading a few funny ones, a few lame ones and others that were just..I don't know.  I for one know why I write, but more and more, my desire to press finger to key wanes.

-5	negative	bipolar-disorder	A realization I have as I get older and older I have this desire to just remain in the middle. Neither side of the fence seems to attract me anymore. Perhaps I'll grow my own grass on tap of this fence.
-2	negative	bipolar-disorder	As cliche as it is, a new year and a new attitude are both in the works for me
-15	negative	bipolar-disorder	As growing up, I got abused by my dad and my life's been in danger. I started cutting at age 12. I tried killing myself. I get bullied at school. I get called stupid by everybody. I come home and get abused by my mom. I get heart broken by guys all the time. People come in and out of my life. I'm worthless and ugly. I don't even deserve to live. I see no purpose of me staying around. My family rejects me and ignores me all the time. I'm always by myself just cutting. I tried doing overdose and drinking to try to kill myself. I also might have a cancer called lukeimia. Life is great.
-15	negative	bipolar-disorder	As the pastor read his sermon over your casket, I looked up at the clear blue sky and wondered if you were up there somewhere, peacefully existing outside of your body. I wondered if you were with your mom. I wondered what it was like, where you are. I wondered if you could see us, as we said good bye to you. I wondered if you saw how many people came and how much they love you.  But I guess I won't know any of these answers until I join you, someday.
-2	negative	bipolar-disorder	At first its fine and you think you have a dark side  it's exciting.
-3	negative	bipolar-disorder	At night when I'm alone in bed, my thoughts go a little haywire. I start to think about things that are..different. And frustrating to myself. I don't even try to explain them to people that I know because I don't want them to know or judge me for bad things that I think and truly believe about myself.
-7	negative	bipolar-disorder	At school, i'm known as the innocent, pure, smart girl that doesn't even cuss. At home, i'm the responsible being and obedient child. In my room, i have a high driven fantasy. I have thoughts squirming in my head, but also in between my legs. The thoughts of being tied up and having one man dominating my desires. The feelings that are up so high that i could feel the heat exhilarating throughout my body. That's who i am. I have dark desires. I am masked by what seems to be innocency, but deep down i crave something more.
-1	negative	bipolar-disorder	At times I feel angry and I ask myself why am I feeling this way?
-14	negative	bipolar-disorder	a year ago I was diagnosed with depression.   I went 6 months, and I only got worse.   Finally the picture started to make sense I my psychiatrist.   I was then diagnosed and am being treated for bi-polar.   I am now on 200 mg of lamarthrogine per days.   Compared to where I was a year ago I am doing so much better, but today I realized I was wrong about everything.   I didn't want to get help for the depression it the bi-polar in the beginning.   I was afraid of the labels.  Then I felt that by taking these magic little pills I would suddenly become happy.  I was wrong.   My life has improved greatly, and I am very thankful for that.   But my level of sadness and unhappiness goes so deep that it was something no pill will ever be able to fix.  Honestly I don know what I am going to do now that I realized that.   I have no idea what happiness even means anymore.   No concept if the feeling at all.
-8	negative	bipolar-disorder	back then i also didn't have emotions but when i met her she also had sadness just by looking at her i met her at the hospital she was getting surgery my great aunt was sick i went into the wrong room but thats when i saw her a cute but painfully sad girl who wanted someone with her her parents where always working when she looked at me my heart stop 
-5	negative	bipolar-disorder	based on my appearance I'd like to know what type of person you think I am. After you tell me I will enlighten you on the real me.
-4	negative	bipolar-disorder	Be careful about the people who talk to you. Words will affect you and have you challenge how you think about yourself.
-1	negative	bipolar-disorder	Been scared and lonely That I get from the bottom of a bottle

That my biggest mistake.after throwing that my life became more worse than!!so I don't know wht should I do now
-18	negative	bipolar-disorder	and it lurks within the pit of my sunshine. I have never given a thought to pester with this beast because I knew that nothing beautiful would ever come out of it. Happy was all I ever was until tragedy struck, I just stood there and took the blow like a deer in the headlights. I couldn't run, couldn't hide, nor could I ever come to face the truth. "if you can't face reality, then just give up, Chelsea." his words hit me like an atom bomb, I couldn't believe my ears. How could he say that to me? My hero, my role model I looked up to him, I TRUSTED him. my demons conjured up something horrific and that night, I somehow made a deal with them. That night every ounce of happiness disintegrated into tiny specks that are worth nothing to me anymore. I am NOTHING. I took his words to heart that night, and gave into the darkness as my blood trickles and flows down my arms, legs, and stomach. Crimson kisses stains my sheet while broken scars keeps me complete.
-1	negative	bipolar-disorder	But never devoted to the dark side. I just have my moments when I can be devoted to some practical humour.
-3	negative	bipolar-disorder	But you'll only see if if you bring it out. If you do anything that hurts me, even if you didn't intend it, sometimes you'll see my dark side. I'll do and say things that I immediately regret afterwards. I feel so bad for the things that I've done and said to other people. For the most part, I've hidden this side of myself away. I keep burying it deeper and deeper, but it's still there, and if you keep digging and digging, you'll eventually find it.
-1	negative	bipolar-disorder	Calling me Disgusting, is the BIGGEST COMPLIMENT you could ever possibly give meso thank you very much EP members. Mission Accomplished! Xoxoxo, OMG, I wanna cry.. NOT!
-7	negative	bipolar-disorder	Can someone explain to me the meaning behind being selfish in your recovery. My spouse uses that often and I feel he uses it as an excuse sometimes to get out of anything with life. He is going to NA and that's pretty much all I hear is that he has to be selfish in his recovery. I didn't really think that made you exempt from being a husband or a father and just playing your play station when you actually are home.. Can anyone clear this up for me please?
-13	negative	bipolar-disorder	Can't deal with how quick things are changing. He found out today that the job he was Meant to have an interview for on the 20th (a job where we wouldn't be able to see eachother) has been changed to this Friday  so it's gone from him having 13 days to find something else to 3. Of course, he could not actually get this job his interviewing for on Friday, which i know sounds horrible, but I hope he doesn't. He's really successful so can more than survive a few months without a job, and I'm too selfish to hope he gets a job even if it means we can't see each other.  So There's a chance Friday could be the last day we see each other,and that thought actually makes me feel sick. I just think my life is going to be rather boring without him.
-1	negative	bipolar-disorder	Cant dwell on the past it was back then this is NOW. Ive failed and Ive fallen. My positivity is at a high right now. Just gotta keep pushing forward. Whether I fall or fail. Ill keep trying and trying harder.
-2	negative	bipolar-disorder	Can u guess what it is lol
-10	negative	bipolar-disorder	Can You Feel the Love?- "Sociopath" is nothing more than a therapist's opinion to me. I dont believe in Anti Social Personality Disorder. Labeling a variety of mindset as a disease seems incorrect. There are a lot of misconceptions about sociopaths. One of them being that a sociopath displays ALL symptoms of APD. My thoughts are this: Im a diagnosed sociopath that loves my brother. Id be a stone cold robot if something happened to him. I havent felt romantic love per se; but I dont think its impossible. Am I this definitive sociopath? Technically, but only because I display a few key traits.
-4	negative	bipolar-disorder	Challenging, ridiculous, painful, rough, tiring, confusing, irritating, interesting (to say the least) are all ways you can describe my relationship with my boyfriend but can't pretty much every couple say the exact same thing about their relationship, regardless of whom they are with?

-9	negative	bipolar-disorder	Could someone tell me more about bipolar disorder? A very good friend of mine recently told me he was bipolar. Normally he is a very friendly outgoing guy but stresses out easily. Before he told me, I thought he was one of the most confusing people I knew. Some days he was hyper and goofy; other days he was tired, stressed out and a bit irritable. The week he told me he was very friendly to me but when he told me he was tired and stressed, and the next several days didn't even come to school. Are there levels of severity in bipolar disorder? How can I help my friend and be there for him when he's feeling down? I don't have his number and he doesn't like texting. Is it possible for someone to have ups and downs even during a manic episode? 
-3	negative	bipolar-disorder	Crying that's all I seem to do anymore. I'm supposed to be getting married to my Airman, but I am so scared because I have absolutely NO idea what is going to happen within the next month I wish someone could just explain to me what to expect. I'm so tired of crying myself to sleep every night and worrying all the time that this fantasy won't come true. Can someone please help me?
-1	negative	bipolar-disorder	Curiosity. Ive noticed quite a few people have been curious about sociopaths. So in an attempt to keep me occupied ask me anything sociopathic related questions you may have and I shall answer from my perspective.
-5	negative	bipolar-disorder	Darkness Is Not Evil It is trueThat evil people and demons often reside in the shadowsBut then againEvil people and demons reside in the daylight as well
-3	negative	bipolar-disorder	Dark, twisted and a bit insane..I am a girl with a broken smile..All I have is a messed up heart..And heaps of pent up emotions..I drop silent tears in silent nights..Resulting in the swollen eyes..I think I am soul dead..Living in the solitude..Trying to overcome the fear of being alone..Smoking up to keep my mind off certain haunting thoughts..Surviving on the pills to save me from dying..But someday I might just take an overdose..Perfect end to another wasted life.
-3	negative	bipolar-disorder	Does anyone cut as an act of willpower? I don't mean to be offensive to anyone who cuts for different reasons, I'm just wondering if anyone has ever done this for my reason.
-4	negative	bipolar-disorder	Does anyone else get an uncontrollable smile when they are about to do something bad? For me a few of times I did it was in a football game and I know I'm about to hurt the other guy
-3	negative	bipolar-disorder	Does anyone else get violent when they are angry? I have been in a few fights at school because I felt like violence was the only way to solve the problem. When people make me mad and keep doing things that anger me I start feeling like I want to beat them. I mostly control it, but sometimes I like to teach people a lesson. 
-3	negative	bipolar-disorder	Doesn't belong here-  This post doesn't belong here but this is where I post the most. I'm just going to say I may be deleting this app. I think I'm done with social media. It does nothing, but make me feel worthless and alone. Not that anyone on here really cares.
-4	negative	bipolar-disorder	Don't cross me. I would black or fade away and I would comeback hearing my self yell racial slurs out at people. I try not to and to keep my self under control but I just can't. I'm not a racist nor will I ever be. It's just that when people get to me I fade away or black out then comeback to see and hear myself yelling racial slurs. Please, don't think of me as a racist because I yell racial slurs when I black out. It's not even towards the community sometimes I do towards my family. But still I try to hold it in. But just don't get to me.
-8	negative	bipolar-disorder	Don't we all? I'm learning to accept and embrace it, while keeping an arm around my light. They're like a yin-yang, complementing and contrasting each other. I guess I'm the defining, containing outline. Perhaps my actions and emotion-triggering/guiding thoughts are. When inherent duality's embraced it's transcended. We are vessels, ideally utilizing our tools with efficiency to meet each situation and go about causing what change we want to see.
-3	negative	bipolar-disorder	Don't we all love double lives? We all have an outer appearance that we show to everyone else but deep down inside is who we truly are. Some are just better at masking it
-5	negative	bipolar-disorder	Do you think loving a MM is loving unconditionally? I would like to think so. Since i dont expect him to leave his wife.  And i do love him so much
-5	negative	bipolar-disorder	Dreamed about the best friend I lost recently. I looked down at my iPhone and she had sent me pictures of her Christmas tree she'd just set up for the holidays with her four year old son. Just like old times. I burst out crying in my sleep.
-1	negative	bipolar-disorder	Ever since I was sent to a half-way house for anger issues that my mom said she "couldn't" handle even though I was 12 and half her size. Something was born inside me, like I felt my mind was pushed to the side and something evil was born in my head, I hear voices and can see this "thing" in my dreams. It has no desire to hurt others but it loves to tear apart the little me that is left and after years of fighting it on my own I conquered it, but I can feel it in my head taunting me and it wants to take control of me to direct a blind fury and I'm afraid because, no one believes me when I tell them about it, I warn everyone around me about this monster and no one listens. I'm afraid of myself.
-6	negative	bipolar-disorder	Every day is another fake laugh or another fake smile. I'm so tired of it. All i want to do is cry and say how i'm feeling. But i know i cant, because nobody will care. Because they'll just think im a freak. I dont know how much longer i can keep faking hapiness
-5	negative	bipolar-disorder	Everyone always thinks i'm really sweet and quiet, and i try to be but even the nicest people have a breaking point. Everyone has a point where they realise they're sick of treating everyone with so much respect and never getting it back. I think people should be treated how they treat others 
-2	negative	bipolar-disorder	Everyone at my school thinks im the happy bubbly person but im no wear close to that Its all an act u cut i cry i starve my self and struggle with depression.

-6	negative	bipolar-disorder	Everyone sees me as that quiet innocent girl in the back of the room. But in my dark side I'm that girl who cuts her upper legs so no one will see the girl who is fascinated by the thought of suicide. Who goes through the depths of her soul
-1	negative	bipolar-disorder	everyones got a dark side deep inside
-3	negative	bipolar-disorder	Everyone thinks I'm insane when I tell them. But I'm pretty sane if I do say so myself. :3 My emotions are as wild as a zebra but yeah. I'm sane. :b I will hurt you or myself if I'm pretty wrecked up but other than that I'm pretty sane I guess.
-3	negative	bipolar-disorder	Everyone thinks I'm just that super sweet naive girl who could do no wrong. How they have been so wrong. I may be quiet but I know allot more than I care to share. I give out this image of a girl who could do no wrong. But I do plenty I have a dark side. Something cold breaths within me. 
-4	negative	bipolar-disorder	Everything will be alright and having a good time and then something small happens I get annoyed and my thought is well now everyone has got to die and from that second on I'm plotting my revenge
-1	negative	bipolar-disorder	Every time I read a book or watch a film I always imagine myself as the bad guy. Don't know why just do. For me their lives seem more full of adventure and spontaneous moments. I like to imagine myself as the psycho.
-2	negative	bipolar-disorder	Excuse me Mother,  I forgot. 
-1	negative	bipolar-disorder	Ex was a liar and a cheater. Claimed he was faithful. Then he filed for divorce and filed a harassment injunction so that my legal representation and I could not ask for the reason of divorce.  5. Liars and Cheaters are usually very hard to tell what they are. Listen to your inner voice if someone gives you the vibe that they lie and cheat go away from them. 
-2	negative	bipolar-disorder	Fighting your own mind is a battle everyday. I never know how I'm gonna feel tomorrow and it's tragic . I am struggling immensely. Mentally and physically. I can't cope. I'm drained. Sometimes I'm so happy and other times I can't stand to be in my own skin another minute. I hate myself so much.

-11	negative	bipolar-disorder	For me eating is a waste of time. Yes it's a necessity but the amount of time some people spend eating is astounding. Not only do I find it a waste of time I find it slows me down, the worst feeling in the world is the one after eating too much.  If I could live without food I would. I hate it, it's a waste of time and effort and I really needed to get that off my chest. I don't think it's unhealthy, after all not eating helps clears my head and helps me focus whereas food slows me down and leaves me feeling sluggish. 
-3	negative	bipolar-disorder	For the past two days I've made an effort. I cry in the mornings when my husband isn't around and then I get showered and dressed and put a smile on my face. But I feel so alone. I miss my baby and everything we had planned. I keep picturing her. My Emily. Was she as scared as I am. Did she feel my love? Will it ever hurt less? I can't sleep at night. I'm dreading going back to reality. I just want my angel. Please God take the pain away

Congrats, you have just had the pleasure of meeting my mask. My shell. The hollow innards which I encompass daily. This cold, fleshy suit. What a chore. But it must be done. To take the mask off is suicide. Obviously. 
-5	negative	bipolar-disorder	Have you ever been in love with someone who makes you feel whole. Someone who makes you feel like you are number one all the time. I met and fell in love with a wonderful woman just like that. For over a decade we shared our lives together in love with each other until a few months ago she died trgically in a car accident. My life since then has never been the same. Now i have lost my sister. I am hurting more that anyone will ever know.
-1	negative	bipolar-disorder	Have you ever thought,  in your bloodstained halls.
-20	negative	bipolar-disorder	He died a week ago, I miss him so much. He suffered too much, but he could always make me laugh. I remember when I was little, he'd spoil me like crazy, even as I got older, he called me his little princess. I miss him so much. I'm crying right now just writing this. I'll never forget him, ever. He was my king, and I was his princess. My last words to him were: "Goodbye, I love you" and he said, "I love you too honey" Here's a letter to him: I love you so much, and miss you so much. I know you're in heaven, but I still want you here with me. I just can't believe you're really gone. I really miss when you used to come over and play with me, or take me out to lunch. I'll see you soon. Love, your princess &lt;3

We would love to feature someone to put a face to this diagnosis that has been severely misrepresented for some time. We would like to dispel myths by meeting the person behind the label.

-3	negative	bipolar-disorder	Hey I was diagnosed with BPD this year and was hospitalised for a month. My impulsivity caused me to repeatedly call a lecturer I was obsessed with. The only thing the woman didn't do was call the cops on me. Since then I've been struggling to keep it together. I have cut off all of my friends because I think they are siding with my ex best friend who has abandoned me (seriously she no longer speaks to me because she is embarrassed by my illness). I am depressed. I didn't go to work today and have no motivation to do anything. I wish my family would just leave me alone and take care of my like I did them for over seven years. I just want to die and go and rest. I don't want to have to deal with anything. I really am fed up of working. I hate my job. Does anyone with BPD feel like they don't want to work or do anything else?

-1	negative	bipolar-disorder	Hi Guys, Nice to know you all  I've been depressed because of malicious gossip.  Why do bad things happen to decent people?
-10	negative	bipolar-disorder	Hi I've been with my boyfriend for 20 years, 5 years ago he was sectioned under the mental health act because he went high, we have two young children I've never seen anything like it before I was on my own with him and my children, I managed to get a friend to take the children so I could get him to the hospital. He tried to run into the road because he thought he was invincible it took a long time to calm him down and after two weeks in hospital and 5years on it's still a struggle the lows are worse, I have to think as myself as a single mum because I can't rely on him 
-1	negative	bipolar-disorder	I almost burnt down my house.
-4	negative	bipolar-disorder	I am a good person, I am a loving, affectionate, attractive person.    No one is perfect.   I like being me and I will remain this way.
-21	negative	bipolar-disorder	I am a male of course and so far I would like to share my story at this point. She left not too long ago. I can see why and know why did it. I was and have been uncontrollable I was around 20 when j was first diagnosed. She had been with me for the past two years asking of my attention. I have been so blinded and a complete monster to her. She was my first victim to hurt. It has been two months and I have been under meds. For about the same time. I can function a little more clearly now. It took for her to finally leave for me to reckon. And it is not too late I tell her. We recently started talking. And she gives me hope. Now that I can see clearly I know she's the one. I have fallen in love with her. And she will give me some time to for me to show her a lot different. Which is all I have dreaming about. 
-9	negative	bipolar-disorder	I am an introvert but at the same time I want nothing more than to find that ONE connection with someone that I will spend the rest of my life with. I want a deep and intense intimate connection and I want it to be just me and her for the most part. Sometimes I wonder if the type of connection I want is too unrealistic and if I am just setting myself up for disappointment and for a lonely life when it comes to love.
-1	negative	bipolar-disorder	I am certainly no stranger to manipulation, even as a young child I found I enjoyed tricking people into benefitting me. There's not a person alive that could escape me if I designated them prey, yet I seem to have a problem manipulating family. Not out of respect, compassion, etc., but out of pride. I feel as if I didn't earn their allegiance. I don't want to use something I didn't earn, that just feels like charity, and I despise charity. I don't necessarily feel like this is norm among most others, and question if it is a symptom of my narcissism. Thoughts ?
-11	negative	bipolar-disorder	I am currently frustrated. I asked my mother if she has ever met anybody who was full blown Bipolar and she said people in her generation don't go around broadcasting it. I said "well you were my age once" and i said i had only met one person, who is actually my friend. Then she went on this rant about how people with diabetes dont go walking around saying "hi im bob and i have diabetes" so why should people with mental disorders tell anybody.  Rachie. 
-5	negative	bipolar-disorder	I am grieving the loss of a friendship. Worse, it's pretty much my fault. But in a way when I consider how far this friend and I had drifted, it makes me wonder why I am grieving so much.  
-2	negative	bipolar-disorder	I am guilty of a great many things. I am capable of things far worse.  Not everything I say has meaning.  
-6	negative	bipolar-disorder	I am indeed a sociopath, but I think that I may also be sadistic. However, I have been feeling very strange lately, because I haven't been happy in a very long time. And I think that is because  haven't hurt someone. After all, there are only a few things in this world that give me pleasure, and seeing others in pain is number one. All I am looking for is advice, I don't see a future for me if I continue down this path, all of my dreams are slowly being ripped away from me, replaced with a vision of me in orange. Please, help if you can.
-5	negative	bipolar-disorder	I am insane. I know this and it amazes me everyday that the world at large does not see it when I so blatantly see it in the mirror. Everyone comes to me in their times of emotional need and they all trust me so fully. No girl has ever turned me down after spending any sort of one on one time with me. And yet I am insane. How can they possibly not see that? I ooooooze insanity out of my eyes, my mouth, my posture. And yet when I go into any social setting, I am king. No wonder governments are so messed up.  
-6	negative	bipolar-disorder	I am not a sociopath. Actually, very far from one, but I think I may have met a sociopath. He intrigues me so much so that I now am about to post questions I wonder about sociopaths in general, in an attempt to understand him better.  Whew Thanks all
-7	negative	bipolar-disorder	i am not a spirutual teller. i just want to help you out . i am medical student,so i just wana help you out, i have magic thought which will make you happier for whole of your life. i am there always for ur help , pls do belief on yourse
-8	negative	bipolar-disorder	I am not perfect, but no one else is either. Not everyone has the same flaws, but we all have them in one way or another. So you can't judge someone, saying they are too flawed, saying they have too many problems, because no one is perfect. When that day comes and you wake up perfect then you can argue I'm wrong. Until then though, don't judge me. Don't you dare say someone is too flawed for you, because you have your problems too you're just too blind to see them.
-6	negative	bipolar-disorder	I am quite insecure. This is my first year going to school without long-sleeves and jackets everyday. Ever since i was in elementary school i wore a jacket to school everyday. I moved to the south and still wore them to school even when it was almost 100 degrees out!! I was soo insecure about my hair on my arms. So i decided to just shave them. Now i can go to school without them and wear short sleeves and 1/2 sleeves. I am proud, but i i'd be prouder when i am able to wear shorts or sandals to school. I guess wearing open or showy clothing makes me uncomfortable at school. I don't mind out in public it is just school
-1	negative	bipolar-disorder	 I am so perfect ssiiikkeee  witch ever way  we can only try I guess 
-2	negative	bipolar-disorder	I am thinking I am bl Today was strange, I hit backToday you were the one who bledOdd thats it red, should be blackLike your heart but my soul is fed
-1	negative	bipolar-disorder	I am trying.  Just a string of thoughts.
-6	negative	bipolar-disorder	I am very interested with this type of thing, sharing my stories with other sociopaths, which I kind of enjoy, since I haven't felt this for quite a while with "others." Unlike my very first story, I am going to start and/or compare some experiences/feelings/thoughts I have from a day to day basis and you could say documenting them on this website. I'm not going to start now, since I simply don't have time.
-2	negative	bipolar-disorder	I am your darkest desires  That I am right
-2	negative	bipolar-disorder	I believe everyone has a dark side .
-9	negative	bipolar-disorder	I believe everyone has a dark side to them. Just like a shadow, it's always lurking close by. I may appear to just be a cute innocent girl but its a lie. Faking a smile and happiness becomes easier and easier. I love darkness even though i fear it. I'm quite unusual considering i sit in my closet for hours doing nothing. I constantly rock back and forth, singing songs such as ring around the Rosie. It's almost as if my mind leaves my body. My conscious is trapped down in a dark dirty well. I never know what to do. I want to feel pain. I place push pins in my arms to substitute cutting. I honestly dont know who I am but I'm on my way to figuring it out as time goes on.
-7	negative	bipolar-disorder	I believe why I spend a lot of time by myself is because I just have to much stuff on my mind all the time. And I just have to be by myself to get it all out. Writing has helped me with that. And when I write poems or quotes about life. I feel better after I get it out of my mind.
-4	negative	bipolar-disorder	I call him sal he is true evil and since I have slight mpd he can be a handful but he destroys things he ruins everything the only thing he doesn't destroy is us tb's I'm quite scared of him too
-2	negative	bipolar-disorder	I came home today. I spent 2 days in a hospital because i tried to kill myself. It wasn't even my goal that night, i just cut a little too deep and a little too far up my arm. I didn't mean to
-5	negative	bipolar-disorder	I can be the most kindhearted precious girl. But I always find myself falling in love with the villains, the bad guys. My heart belongs to the angels but a part of me loves the evil thrill of dark daring demons
-8	negative	bipolar-disorder	I can feel it Welling up, slowly consuming my soul a little every day. The Darkness, the anger, the pain the depression. It's eating at me slowly corrupting my core. I want to hurt so many people, I want to escape from this life. There are so many things my dark side wants. I feel as though I can't control myself much more, my hands are shaking from anger towards this world and all that live on it, but I do not understand why I think I need help helpme
-4	negative	bipolar-disorder	I can recall from even my earliest childhood that I used to talk to myself throughout the day. I would have whole discussions and conversations where I even presented other angles than my own on the subjects and argumented for those in context of my specific view. How about you?
-2	negative	bipolar-disorder	I can't get you out of my head. Just wish you would call but I know you won't. It's over and besides after all the stuff you said to me and put me through, I shouldn't want you back. I never should have let you that close and will keep the past two christmas's in mind when I meet the next person.
-1	negative	bipolar-disorder	I carved the number 17 into the topside of my wrist. It's about one inch by one inch. It's a white scar now and I still like it.
-1	negative	bipolar-disorder	I didn't know there is a name for people like me. In fact, for a long time I thought there was just something wrong with me. Then about three years ago, after some intense google searching trying to diagnose myself with some kind of mental disorder I came across the expression Introvert. Ok so that explains why I can't make new friends or hold down a job for more than a week. Sometimes I can't even go to the grocery store without getting a minor panic attack. To me, introversion is a curse. I don't want to be this way, but I can't change. I've just had to learn how to adapt my life around it.
-2	negative	bipolar-disorder	I do. And I think it is starting to show.. what a good way to start the new year =p
-4	negative	bipolar-disorder	I do have a dark side, and I struggle with it every day. I have a darkness inside that is struggling to break free of my control. I think bad things, very bad things, but I cannot do these things because many people would get hurt. I've been to counseling and that didn't help. I've even gone as far as psychiatric assistance and I was prescribed medication that made me a zombie; I literally could not think anymore. So, I struggle with the darkness inside me. I could take the east way out and take the pills, but I really don't want to stare at the wall and drool on myself all day.
-1	negative	bipolar-disorder	I do indeed have a dark side, so to speak. to many.
-1	negative	bipolar-disorder	I do love Edgar Allan Poe, im totally gothic person, i do love draculaand all kind of books and movies..
-4	negative	bipolar-disorder	I don't know really. I've been grappling with it ever since I heard of the phenomenon. I feel anger. Im not a robot; but I think people are way too emotional, too dependent on everybody else. People who cry just annoy me. I know its wrong but I cant stand weak people, my dad included. They literally enrage me and I feel no guilt about it. But its always an irrational rage. I always thought everybody secretly felt the same way and I wonder if it will have any effect on what I want to do with my life.
-5	negative	bipolar-disorder	I don't Know what's up, I am constantly aggravated or bothered by everyone I see and talk to As if I just want everyone to shut up. I want to go somewhere and yell as loud as possible. I am just tired of looking at feces that mean nothing to me
-1	negative	bipolar-disorder	I don't know what that ad is for, but the choices are band-aids, staples, and ethanol.  Band-aids, that's no fun!  First I staple him up, then I pour on the ethyl alcohol.  I just can't keep my mouse away rom the stapler and the alcohol.  Ouch. 
-6	negative	bipolar-disorder	I don't know why, but it REALLY irritates me when people claim that having mood swings makes them Bipolar. Nobody understands it.  The overall ignorance about what it really is leads to people not taking it seriously.  A lot of people just think that it means that I have a bunch of mood swings.  That is NOT the case.  I wish more people could understand it
-8	negative	bipolar-disorder	I don't know why it is but every time someone is talking one if my friends has to be rude and start talking over them and changes the subject. He's so rude he has a loud laugh and acts so over dramatic it's ridiculous. It's like all the attention is on him, and that's not even half of it! 
-1	negative	bipolar-disorder	I don't really have problems with anyone. I know mostly everyone's secrets. And people usually like me . But mess with me or something I care about and you will wish you hadn't
-7	negative	bipolar-disorder	I don't really understand myself at all. I smile one moment, and later I get all scary and serious. People who don't know me well see me as the complete opposite of friendly. They describe me as a boring lady who would push every one away. Well, I do admit that I have that side of me. Sometimes, it just snaps. I don't know why or when it would happen, but it's just there somehow. I didn't really grow up normally, so I guess that's why If talking and playing with yourself since you're the only child in the house is any indication of abnormality.  All I can say is that I'm not totally proud of this but I don't hate it either. Guess it's like self defense. Haha.
-7	negative	bipolar-disorder	I do spend most of my time with myself especially when I'm away from home. At the age of 22, I'm more mature than a typical 22 year old. My friends are way older than me but acts so immature. It's one reason I prefer to hang around with the older crowd who talks about things that actually makes sense. Not some crappy things that are useless to the mind.
-8	negative	bipolar-disorder	I drink smoke have done drugs and had some of the lowest and best times of my life using them. Every weekend i go out meet men and women and go home with some of them but then I will go to church the very next morning, sometimes even reading or teaching, and they do not know what I have been doing. Nobody knows the true me. Only the side I allow them to see.
-5	negative	bipolar-disorder	I ended up in the hospital twice they say I was having mania and I see it now.l was completely bonkers could I have always been this way???
-2	negative	bipolar-disorder	I enjoy helping others. I really do.   I can never convince myself that anyone deserves it.  We're all innately good, but we're all innately bad, too.  My dark side only comes out in bed, I think.
-9	negative	bipolar-disorder	I enjoy social alchemy, stirring things up. I have fantasized about killing someone but not just the act itself; the preperations, the hunt, the screams and finally still silence, the blood and the poignant/ artful display of the body and meticulous cleaning. All for the experience so that I can say, "I've done that and to excellence" because when I am passionate about something, I like to do it to perfection. I have a strong desire for a man equally capable of these things perhaps because I want someone I can identify with and vice versa. But how well could we really trust and enjoy each other?
-1	negative	bipolar-disorder	I fantasize about dominating a woman
-3	negative	bipolar-disorder	I feel ignored everyday. People say hi and I say hi back but that's about it. I am dating a girl named Taylor and I know she really cares about me, I just have trouble opening up to her. I don't know what to do.
-1	negative	bipolar-disorder	I feel like I'm two people in one body. I always fight with myself, I'm indecisive, and I always collide within myself. One side of me is happy to live and only talks to people worth my time. She feels superior and beautiful and is also a incredible actor. The other side is depressed, feels worthless, wants to be everyone's friend but has too much anxiety. My other side can not act she is expressionless due to her internal pain.
-4	negative	bipolar-disorder	I feel like the worst type of dark side, is not being a worshiper of Satan, or someone who feels they can murder without regret, buy someone who knows they have a dark side, but doesn't know what it is they're capable of. That is me.
-7	negative	bipolar-disorder	I fell in love with someone who tried to tell me I need them. I met someone else who told me they loved me and because she said it first, I believed her. Why do people say they love you if they don't mean it?
-10	negative	bipolar-disorder	if i ever watch too much tv or netflix(as of recently), i hear voices of the people i was just hearing. not saying any exact lines from whatever they were from, just them, talking. i find myself listening to them more than i think to myself. when i do catch myself listening i think, "i wonder if this makes me crazy" just tuning into something that isn't real. i'm diagnosed schizoaffective, which is like schizophrenia and bipolar disorder combines, but is that an excuse? i feel stuck.  i'm loving my life right now, but i HATE myself.
-4	negative	bipolar-disorder	If I had to name one person that I was close to in this world, this existence, I would say that it is my brother. I'm getting a migraine.
-4	negative	bipolar-disorder	If I were to die tomorrow would they say in livid poetry he didnt have much love and he waited around for her to fall deeply and madly from that tree over there
-3	negative	bipolar-disorder	I forget how lucky I am, as I sit here feeling it cos I didn't get my call tonight. I am so greatful that I hear his voice 9 nights out of 10 and I appreciate that it is not the same for everyone and I spare a thought tonight for all you out there who only hear their mans voice once a week. Have a bright hopeful New Year!
-6	negative	bipolar-disorder	If you are thinkin of committing suicide tonight and you are looking for a sign not to, here is your sign. Do not committ suicide because there is so much ahead for you. I love you and I believe in you. You are amazing
-6	negative	bipolar-disorder	If you have stuff you want to talk about or vent about, feel free to contact me. I usually am the listener in my crowd and don't mind it. I tend to really want to hear people's stories and experiences.Trying to pay it forward for all those who have been there for me. From strangers on a bus to a woman in a waiting room and friends but new and old who took time and care to be there for me.
-12	negative	bipolar-disorder	I get into these really dark, depressive moods sometimes. Once every few days. Sometimes for a few hours a day. It varies. When I get into these moods I just want to be completely alone - I don't want to interact with anyone or be false and pretend that I feel great. I just want to be alone with my thoughts. I don't want to talk to anyone, and I don't want anyone to question why I'm being the way I am. It's like a very deeply-pitted sense of sadness mixed with anger. I can't explain it at all.  Sometimes I listen to music during these moods and it helps. I love the song 'Lithium' by Evanescence because it describes my feelings perfectly. I know I come across as cold sometimes but I can't help it. I think of death. Knives. I know I could kill someone. Darkness kind of takes over me. I am able to hide it around people if I have to. I guess it's a part of who I am.
-3	negative	bipolar-disorder	I get the impresscold people think I'm cold and unapproachable, I'm reasonably attractive, tall slim and blonde yet people don't chat with me or try to catch my eye. I've been told I seem too cold and aloof, it's not that, I'm terrified! 
-6	negative	bipolar-disorder	I got accepted into an imaging study for bipolar patients. They are going to take an MRI of my brain.  I was on lamictal. Due to money problems, I've been off for a while. Now I get to take part in an imaging study. All I want is to know that it's real. That it's not in my head. 
-10	negative	bipolar-disorder	I grew up hard. Not worse than a lot of people, but it was crazy. My defense was to have detachable morals. I can make myself not feel any emotion for anyone else. Even my own kid. I have not gone there for years, but it's always available. I guess I did it so I could steal food and take things from people when I had to. It has come in handy though. I am now a police officer, and one day I went on a call, only to find a dad sexing up his toddler. I was going to shoot him then and there. Could not control myself, until I detached. Then I just did my job.
-2	negative	bipolar-disorder	I guess I haven't really decided to be happy but happiness just hit me in the face, I'm loving myself and I'm feeling confident and happy I don't know why but I am loving this. I haven't felt this good in years. (: hopefully this happiness stays with me for a long time.
-8	negative	bipolar-disorder	I guess that my dark side is more of something that I need to keep in check. It's part of me and I love that part of me but the line is very thin and the balance at times seems very fragile. There are times though that I want to cut loose and let it run wild but I'm afraid that doing so will make me lose the things I cherish and hold dear to my heart. It is a dark side that has revealed itself in times of need and in times of pure emotion but it is so heavy and concentrated that it can become like a drug with every release. You know what I mean?
-12	negative	bipolar-disorder	I had a best friend. i thot he was my bff.we knew each other for 10 yrs! i trusted him early this year, we fought. im not quite sure wat's d reason. he just ignored me. im very hurt. then he's telling all my frnds dat im bad. but they dint trust him. now i have 1 TRUE frnd. she knows me better den myself. i hope our frndship will remain..ILL NEVER TRUST BOYS..EVER!!!!!!
-11	negative	bipolar-disorder	I had a friend her and i loved each other like we were family. we hung out nearly everyday and often skyped and often talked over the internet too. during this summer i was in Florida for the whole summer. she had family fairly close to where i was staying and wanted to surprise me with a visit. On her way there it started raining really bad, her cousin who was driving couldn't see the stopped semi truck in front of themthey rear-ended the semi and killed her instantly and severely injured her cousin..everyday i think of her. she will always have a place in my heart and will always be in my heart no matter what :') 
-1	negative	bipolar-disorder	I hate her 2 much/ she stared wit me. O heck nosh e going to pay.
-1	negative	bipolar-disorder	Ihate her much. she is evila nd stared at me. what! oh heck no! she goonna pay!
-2	negative	bipolar-disorder	ihate her so much. she isevil O no. she goin 2 pay.
-1	negative	bipolar-disorder	I hate to confess this, but I fell asleep by the pool. Now, I have a dark side.
-9	negative	bipolar-disorder	I have 6 sisters and 5 brothers. My 2nd oldest brother has cerebral palsy. He can t speak like me and you but we no what hes saying. His hands and legs don t work well either. He can t swollow his spit very well and carries a wash cloth to catch the extra running down his chin. Well on the way out ,in the parking lot a person come by us and told the person they were with (that some people should leave there retarded kids at home. Thats all it took. All the older kids ran to those people and started saying things to them that made them hurry to there car and leave. From that day on if any one even looked at him wrong. They had a problem on there hands because you did nt make fun of are brother. With out having us kids in your face. 
-5	negative	bipolar-disorder	I have a conversation with Death daily.Sometimes I say Not today.Other times I say Tell me more.Then the times the words just become white noise with everything else.
-2	negative	bipolar-disorder	I have a dark side, and I kinda like it
-1	negative	bipolar-disorder	I have a dark side because I do haters gonna hate lol jk but seriously sometimes I had weird dreams of killing people it's cool but weird
-10	negative	bipolar-disorder	I have a dark side full of demons. I found these Demons every night. The demons have voice. These demons are my insecurities, my deepest fears, and my lonely nights. They are the insults I receive and the emotions I can't contain. They are a part of me and are what I have become. The demons tell me to cut. They talk to me every late night.
-7	negative	bipolar-disorder	I have a dark side.  I dont really have a name for it, but it is there.  I can physically feel it sometimes.  Sometimes when it comes up I can literally feel it in my chest.  When that happens its not just an emotion.  Its real.  Its better sometimes than it is other times.   But when it surfaces, every single noise fades out.  I can still hear it, but im not listening.  I think about bad things.  Involving other people.  And they never have any idea about what im thinking about.
-8	negative	bipolar-disorder	I have a dark side, it scares me. It wants to see chaos, hurt, death, pain and blood. It wants to make people suffer for the things they have done in the past. My dark side is slowly corrupting me, and the worst part? Even though it scares me I want it to take control. 
-5	negative	bipolar-disorder	I have a dark side . Sometimes it scares me the way I think. One day I'll snap. Maybe they should of listened.. Only time will tell!
-4	negative	bipolar-disorder	I have a penchant for the forbidden. People dont see it because I appear very reserved, dress prim and proper. But oh, my thoughts! I have to keep them in check.
-9	negative	bipolar-disorder	I have a question for the rest of you. Obviously, I have not interacted with a large number of sociopaths to know for sure, so I turn to you guys for an answer. When you have to meet someone spontaneously, be it for a job interview, blind date, chat room, or random stranger on the street, what is your feeling towards it? Are you indifferent, excited, nervous, or normal? Normal and indifferent are probably on the same track, but idk. Me, personally, I feel nothing. Another sociopath I met was willing to fly across the country to hang out. Is it just us two (not literally) that are like that, or is it one of the many qualities her and I share with other sociopaths?
-6	negative	bipolar-disorder	I have a side of me I'd rather few see, but it's a side I'd rather like to indulge in. It is the flip side of the coin which is me. It is my contradiction. It is my addiction. It is my mistake. It is my pleasure. Is it really me? Is it truly who I am? Is me being nice, kind, and polite all a well executed act?
-3	negative	bipolar-disorder	I have a side of me that tries to be happy, and joyful. A side that holds the person I wish I was.  I wish I was normal. I wish I met societies approval. Why does being different, have to have a price to pay?
-2	negative	bipolar-disorder	I have a very dark side but I'm working on it.
-4	negative	bipolar-disorder	I have a very dark side. It honestly scares me. Scares me so much that I don't allow myself to get that way.  I can't even talk about it smh
-6	negative	bipolar-disorder	I have a very very bad dark side. When I'm on my dark side I fight with anyone who gets in my way. If I get caught I get punished for it. But if I get away with it I don't get punished for it.
-2	negative	bipolar-disorder	I have been working on a plan of sorts and have been missing a crucial piece which pretty much fell into my lap today, as if delivered on high.  The only drawback now is my mind is polishing and structuring conversations so much I can't even sleep.  Laid in bed for an hour and a half with all the factors and ways of dealing with them flying through my mind.  Anyone ever get like this? Or just have a plan so grand and brilliant you can't do anything but run through it over and over?
-3	negative	bipolar-disorder	I have both living and deceased family members who had and have cancer.
-10	negative	bipolar-disorder	I have commitment issues so when someone starts to get close I get scared and I try to push them away. I don't like doing this because I often care about  the people I'm pushing away. Like my exes I've broken up with all my bfs after they told me they loved me I don't know why and then they continue to chase me so I make up stuff to try and make them not love me XP it's heart breaking and mentally horrible
-4	negative	bipolar-disorder	I have given my heart to a man that is has taken it and has broken it up in very small pieces, but I can't seem to let him go. I really feel that this his cry for help. I'm very willing to help him get the treatment he needs. I just don't know how to go about with it. So here my heart breaks everyday more and more for a man that I love and care about deeply. 
-3	negative	bipolar-disorder	I have grown tired of the monotony of this website and its never-ending cycle of the same 3 stories. "Am I a sociopath?" "Is my ex a sociopath?" and "Im so edgy". Essentially: I am bored
-3	negative	bipolar-disorder	I have ideally 31lbs to lose or at least 21lbs in order to not be considered overweight.  I'm so tired of this extra weight, it's holding me back!  I don't want to date, I don't want to go out, I don't want to meet new people or try new things.  I just want to get this done so I can move forward!  I've struggled with this my entire life and have lost about 50lbs, but the rest of this journey isn't coming easy for me.
-5	negative	bipolar-disorder	I have. I think it is even worse than I thought. I always thought, I can control this side of me but I can't. Some people say this dark side of me.. They don't know what it is, but it's so strong and seems dangerous. I kinda like it. It draws a line between me and the world. I even thought about killing people and didn't feel bad, I don't know what that means..
-9	negative	bipolar-disorder	I have just started ECT in the last  couple of months. The jury is out for me whether it works,as I donot know what to expect from recovery.  I am bipolar 2 and find I have depression for 2-3 days after treatment 2 days of feeling good and then 2days of depression before I have treatment again.  My question is am I suppose to feel well for the whole time after the treatment? If some one could letme know that would be good.
-8	negative	bipolar-disorder	I have made suggestions about my dark side and have talked to my close friends while experiencing it, but there is still more that I haven't shared with even them. I hope someday I can share it with them. I really want to have a few people know the whole me. But, I am nervous. What if I scare them? What if I end up getting hurt?
-3	negative	bipolar-disorder	I have my days where I want to die then days when I want to burn everything and kill people;-:
-8	negative	bipolar-disorder	I have often thought about if I had a gun I would shoot the people dead who make me mad when driving. For that reason I won't ever own a gun because I know I would kill someone. The "sicker" part about it is that I wouldn't even care WHO it was that I killed. I realized that I need anger management I've gotten into fights for my road rage. I've literally dragged someone out of their car and beat their face in.
-4	negative	bipolar-disorder	I have problems trusting and opening up to people. I have had horrible experiences trusting someone then being hurt. It's like my parents, I used to trust them. I would talk to them and tell them things then they would hit/yell/cuss/threaten me
-6	negative	bipolar-disorder	I have read some stories on other people's experiences dealing with someone that is bipolar and it brought me to tears. :'(  I want to thank everyone that has shared their stories. It shows me that I'm not alone and it's nice to have a place to go and get my story out because you all understand. My family and friends don't get it and want me to end the relationship, but I can't do it. I love him with all my heart. 
-2	negative	bipolar-disorder	I have so many people who hate that I'm very honest sarcastic and I speak my mind but oh well  tell it like it is, that's what I say (: I won't change who I am to impress other people :p
-3	negative	bipolar-disorder	I have to admit I am really looking forward to seeing my MM tomorrow. It's been 3 and a half weeks but it feels much longer. All a bit silly really 
-3	negative	bipolar-disorder	I have to be strong for my kids. At the end of the day all the other -ish doesn't matter. They are my reason to be.
-2	negative	bipolar-disorder	I have tried, but I can't write about it, I can't because I know we'll never get over, there's no way it'll pass
-4	negative	bipolar-disorder	I have two sides. It's like one side takes control one day and the other takes hold the next.
-11	negative	bipolar-disorder	I He Wants Me To Take A Lie Detector Test That was months ago, and now he wants me to take the test at the local police station. Not only is it 450$, but I wonder just how accurate this test is going to be??? And if it is even a good idea. I have nothing to hide, but I wonder what this will do to our relationship? Am I going to feel the same about him when its all done? Will I still love him the way I do now?
-13	negative	bipolar-disorder	I hide her. She used to be me but now I'm better. I hope I'm better. She keeps giving me doubts and drives me insane. I might as well be insane. I fantasise about what it would be like to do wrong and immoral things. But she's hidden. She's not allowed to talk or she gets punished. I must be perfect. I mustn't cry. I must be beautiful in a world of beautiful people. But the reality is that many are ugly. Beauty isn't skin deep. And many have dark sides. Is this beauty or does this account as ugliness? We're all a little bit of a sociopath. So do I have a dark side if I like "weird and unusual things?" Or is that normal? If it's what everyone has, I'm hiding my normal side
-2	negative	bipolar-disorder	I hope so too but it never happens.
-7	negative	bipolar-disorder	I just read something about this and I come from it at a point like this.  I have always known how I would kill myself, since I was 12 that method of killing myself has not changed (taking the sharpest knife and stabbing it into my bellybutton as slow as I could), I know how to make my self suffer, that way has never changed since then. So for me it's kind of a messed up way of no I'm not but If I LET IT go that way I know how to do in a suffer the longest, that hasn't changed in the years.
-3	negative	bipolar-disorder	I just started mood stabilizers and Zoloft. I know it's supposed to take some time for these to take effect, but I felt really good for the past two days. Almost back to my normal self, pre-outbursts and memory return. I have been miserable with anxiety all day and I can't sleep. Anyone have experience with meds like these?
-2	negative	bipolar-disorder	I just started realizing that I have a dark side. I was talking to a friend who is into the same stuff as me you know like supernatural creatures blood cemeteries  the list goes on and that's when I realized that I'm into dark things I was so concerned and intrigued that I asked my history teacher since he studies supernatural stuff and its getting worse It kind if heightens my ability to not sleep and it messes with my eating habits it's constantly on my mind I even fricking research on it it's they bad
-1	negative	bipolar-disorder	I just wanted to go over a few things. I don't know why I wrote this. Just one of those nights.
-1	negative	bipolar-disorder	I just want to explode into the world. I must release it now or forever hold it to destroy.
-13	negative	bipolar-disorder	I just want to say I'm so glad I don't know anyone here personally. Because I've been holding all this in for a while and I don't want a soul to know. Not only is this embarrassing, I'm very ashamed I let myself go so bad. I've always been a bigger body type. I'm italian so I'm so inlove with carbs and eating all the time. Ever since I was little I've always had a problem with my weight. In high school, I never weighted more than 180. Sophomore year, I lost a good 40 pounds and was the smallest I've ever been on high school. Fast forward two years after high school after being on birth control I now am 215. Mind you, I am 5ft 3. No one knows my weight. Not even my husband. I've found this book called "the omni diet" off amazon. I haven't started it yet but I'll update whenever it comes in the mail. 140 is my goal weight again. And I'm hoping to lose 45 by July. Let's keep our fingers crossed! Also, I love advice and tips! So please do so(:
-1	negative	bipolar-disorder	I keep wishing my my mom wont wake up.. I feel my life would b simpler.. More positive and much easier.. I know she thinks she's taking care of me and teaching me.. But i am 30 years old.. I am not a kid.. And am fed up of the burden of trying to please her all the time..
-6	negative	bipolar-disorder	I know I can still draw a line between fantasy and realitybut I'm definitely pushing it, and I know someday I'm gonna snap and I'll love it.
-4	negative	bipolar-disorder	I know I'm the farthest thing from perfect but I wish I had more confidence in myself. I'm very self conscious & I can't stand when someone make fun of me. They may not realize it but sometimes the things people say to me really bother me. I'll never forget what you say to me if it makes me really upset. There's one thing that none of my family or friends know about meI've thought of killing myself many times. Never actually harmed myself but I've thought about it a lot. I learned that writing my thoughts down helps mebut I have times where I feel so weak & I start to believe I don't belong here. I feel stuck. I wish I could tell someone close to me this but I'm afraid they won't want to be my friend anymoreor they'll think I'm selfish. I'm not though. I just can't control my thoughts
-14	negative	bipolar-disorder	I know it's true. I am. I am extraordinarily high functioning. I know I'm a narcissist I know I have a false send of superiority and intelligence over everyone I've met. But my questions for you are, do any of you not want to be the way you are? Are any of you as self aware as I am? Do you see things throughout the day that other people don't understand? When you socialize does it ever feel like you're inside the other persons head? And you know exactly why they say every word they do and their motive and what they want you to say? I have so many question. I need your help to show me I'm not alone. That I can explain why I am the way I am. It has gotten so hard for me to live in a world where no one can even begin to fathom my thoughts and comprehension. I have no empathy for humans, but I want to. Does anyone else want to be able to love? I implore you to respond with opinions and questions of your own.
-4	negative	bipolar-disorder	I know this seems like a strange question to ask. I just want to know, I suppose. It's been driving me crazy. Well, thank you for reading.
-1	negative	bipolar-disorder	I like being imperfect if I were perfect I would not be noticed
-7	negative	bipolar-disorder	i like to hurt people for as long as i can it makes me happy especially when i get something out of it. targeting someone and finding out how i can hurt them, what they want and how i can stop them getting it, gaining there trust and using it against them is like a game and i always win. one guy got very close to killing himself i thought it was funny because its just so stupid of him  well that's all for now i don't care if you think badly of me say what you want
-2	negative	bipolar-disorder	I like to lie. Not when it's going to get me or someone else in trouble, but to alter bits of my personality, and form into a few different people.  I'm really weird.
-14	negative	bipolar-disorder	I like to think I'm a nice person. I'm pretty shy, but I do my best to be as polite and helpful as possible. If I drink too much, however, my inner demon gets out. Most people think it sounds cute, picturing me as a feisty drunk girl talking smack. But that is not it at all. I only ever got drunk enough for this to happen once, and since then I only drink when in the presence of my parents or someone who I know will watch me. Anyways, I kinda threatened to kill anyone who came close to me, or bit them, leaving teeth shaped bruises. I almost ripped off my boyfriend's roommate's ear, too. And that is why I always volunteer to be the designated driver! :3
-1	negative	bipolar-disorder	I like to think of myself as a living BoomBox.  
-4	negative	bipolar-disorder	I look colourful girl,with big smile.I tend to joke,cover my self with sarcasim and I drown my self in my friends talk sothis is just glance of my dark side
-5	negative	bipolar-disorder	I lost all the people around me who i talk to or trust, my boyfriend had a girlfriend the entier time we were together, my father does drugs, my youngest brother is strugglen, im fail-ing in school, i dont have many friends, i cry 4-5 times a day, i cut myself, im not perfect, my heart crys for attition .. Im more alone than ever .
-1	negative	bipolar-disorder	I lost my 18 year old son, Andrew, on October 16, 2010.  
-1	negative	bipolar-disorder	I lost my 8 days ago. He was 53.  I just wanted to share my story and maybe have someone who has been in the same situation. I don't know. I don't know at all.
-3	negative	bipolar-disorder	I lost my aunt last year (She was 2 because she had cancer, and my papaw a couple months ago due to health issues My two must important people in my life who made a differnece in my life that I will never forget.
-11	negative	bipolar-disorder	i lost my dad 3 weeks ago to lung kidney and bone cancer. it left a gigantic void in my heart because dad had parkinsons disease as well. he was the greatest father you can ask for and did not deserve all those horrible things in his later years. a month before he died he cried. moms asked whats wrong? he pointed at my nieces and nephews and said in a soft voice in spanish yo nunca lo vere crecer. meaning i will never see them grow up..i love you dad and i stood there by your side untill your final breath..r.i.p daddy
-1	negative	bipolar-disorder	I lost my grandma in July 13'. No pain, no cancer, no tears.
-5	negative	bipolar-disorder	I lost my Husband 7 months ago.  I miss him so much, the emptiness and loneliness are the hardest things to deal with.  I put a smile on my face and push myself everyday.  People say it gets easier but no one tells me if the broken heart I have will ever stop hurting.  He was my life, my sole mate, and my best friend.   We were together 9 years and married 3 1/2. 
-1	negative	bipolar-disorder	I lost my Mom June 15, 2013. She was 66 and it was her 35th wedding anniversary with my Dad.  I don't know how to do it without her.
-6	negative	bipolar-disorder	i lost my sweet husband to brain aneurysm at just 22. he was a wonderful father and husband  i was just 25 when he died. i was left caring for our two young children alone. our son was five and our daughter just newborn. he was my entire world it took a long time to decide to date again10 years to be exact. its still a uphill battle and i fight depression daily. i am still angry at god.. and i hold alot of anger inside. they say time heals all wounds but i think some wounds just fester. i miss him every day.
-7	negative	bipolar-disorder	I love a man with Bipolar Disorder, but have sadly come to the conclusion that I can't have him in my life.  I wanted to be stronger, I wanted to understand, I wanted to be there in his time of need, but feel that his illness is destroying me along with him.  I feel so profoundly sad and alone.  My grief, this loss, it feels insurmountable. Is there someone out there that can relate to these feelings?  Someone who can help me? My feelings are so mixed up.  I don't recognize my love right now, he is cruel and hateful.  I can't stop him from making self destructive choices, I can't fix him, I have to let him go, and need help.
-2	negative	bipolar-disorder	I love to do it  Men so depending on my mood that minute I will flirt or tease back . It's excitingly fun.
-3	negative	bipolar-disorder	I love to learn. Learning has no limit or age. Learning something makes me feel satisfied. I feel every piece of knowledge I store in my brain will do me good one day. Learning is a must for children, parents, etc. Parents who are educated can help their children with homework and not get frustrated. Learning is survival. Survival is living.
-9	negative	bipolar-disorder	I love when people write in this category. It's like they have come to terms with them self. Now it's my turn  I am not perfect but then again no one is and i know i am a good person :D
-2	negative	bipolar-disorder	 I love you forever I never forget you.. you were so incredible, amazing human i was very lucky to have you, to be your favourite thank you for everything you did for me, all the care, all the lessons all moments you spent with me 
-6	negative	bipolar-disorder	I love you I really do but I understand if you despise me. I miss you with everything in me. I want things to be how they where before. Me the daddies girl and you the proud father of me. I tried so hard to be the best daughter I could be. I guess my demons took over. I don't regret my actions i just regret that in my learning process of my life my lessons came between me and you. I've learned but obviously not the way you wanted me to.  I'm sorry&lt; 3
-13	negative	bipolar-disorder	I'm 13 and have already spent my whole life without a brother. I have two older sisters. I can only imagine how better my life would be if I had a big brother that I could hang out with and run to every time i face a problem. Nobody listens. Anyways It'd super awesome to have a younger brother too. My parents are 44 and 42. It means they wasted their fertile years in their 30s without trying to conceive. There's still a chance for them though cuz heck our neighbor had her baby when she was nearing 50. Mom can take hormones to make sure the baby will be a male. I know that my older sister is in a serious relationship and may get engaged soon but a brother would be way better than a nephew/niece
-7	negative	bipolar-disorder	Im 35 now living with BPD sometimes in denial sometimes coping, much of the time smoking too much weed to block it out feeling lonely and or depressed, which is a cycle of occasionally coming out of the bubble I have created for myself finding enthusiasm positivity desire and hope, to latching on to these things too tight, they break and im crushed again and my barriers go back up. I have had no contact with any doctors in years and I cant push myself to seek help.
-2	negative	bipolar-disorder	Im a bit stuck with my life I dont really have any big problems, Im 25 years old and I have no big record of failures in my past, my present is quite perfect in all aspects of my life, and I dont see any trouble having a nice future only thing is: it just doesnt feel right, I lack of a purpose, I dont really have any passion about anything, and my ordinary days seem to go day by day, week by week, month by month without any real thrill, Im bored with my life and Im struggling to find a way to burst through this lack of passion and purpose. Any one has been through this and have any tips that you could lend me for a change?
-12	negative	bipolar-disorder	I made a new friend a few months ago, someone who became important to me. It was an unexpected friendship. One that developed surprisingly, as I discovered more under the surface than I thought at first glance.  I know I'm a good person, a good friend; it's his loss, blah, blah, blah, but the sadness I feel at losing a friend is real. I miss talking with him throughout the day. Now I rarely hear from him. He's found someone else or possibly a few others with whom he spends his time. I don't really understand why our friendship faded, but I need to accept it and let go. It just makes me sad that my friendship wasn't as important to him as his was to me. 
-1	negative	bipolar-disorder	I'm a single mom  looking for a single dad.
-4	negative	bipolar-disorder	I'm becoming more obsessed with the darker things in this world. I am at home in the darkness, it's where I belong.
-2	negative	bipolar-disorder	I'm changing my picture for 5 minutes. Ladies ~ ENJOY Guys ~ don't be jerks!
-16	negative	bipolar-disorder	I meet my boyfriend almost 2 years ago he had just got out of prison and he was do what he could to get his 2 kids back. We started off slow and he had already told me about his past and that he was a recovering addict. But he wanted a better life for him and his kids I believed him but then when we decided to have a kid together he started leaving me at his with kids for hours and coming back late at night knowing that I didn't feel comfortable like. I talked to him he said he would stop then it just got worse and in between this time I did get pregnant and I got scared I had my 4 year old so I left he told me we need to work things out I said it was going to take awhile because I didn't trust but I still loved him. Now I have not spoken to him in almost 2 weeks. I just want to move on. But its really had we were together for almost 2 years. It hurts so much to know that he could not be here for me because he hadn't let go of his past yet.
-3	negative	bipolar-disorder	I'm gonna Crate a new account just for my reason so if u wanna know why just inbox me it's a weird part of me that I wanna express more and I'm scared to tell anyone about it they might think I'm weird so yeah
-3	negative	bipolar-disorder	My New Years Resolution is to believe this. &nbsp;It's going to be a fantastic year for me whatever happens. &lt;3
-1	negative	bipolar-disorder	I'm hard in myself because every time i do something wrong, i get yelled at and it makes me not want to continue on, i shut down.
-2	negative	bipolar-disorder	I'm having problems with my parents and I'm just getting down about it. Got nobody to talk about it but would like someone to talk to and cheer me up.
-8	negative	bipolar-disorder	I miss you. Everything is different now to the point where it can never be the same again. I grieve for everything we had and everything you used to be. Because I still love that person, I always will. I know you don't care about me anymore and that is what hurts the most. You promised you always would, and I truly believed you. I feel so alone and lost, I just want things to magically go back to the way they used to be. To when we were the best of friends, and told each other everything. I would give anything to have you back. I am devastated that you are gone forever.   
-3	negative	bipolar-disorder	I'm just wonder if a guy would ever accept me for who i am. What if I'm never good enough for any guy
-7	negative	bipolar-disorder	I'm not 100% good I have a bad,side I love revenge I am super devious and if I don't get what I want I devise plans and evil blue prints to get it.If someone does something to hurt me I make sure that I secretly make their life miserable. I laugh at haters especially when I kno something's about to happen I have even lowered myself to frame once but I don't really do that unless it is a last resort.
-1	negative	bipolar-disorder	I'm not always happy. I'm not always sympathetic. If someone takes it too far, I know I won't be able to stop myself from saying something I'll probably regret.
-19	negative	bipolar-disorder	i'm not pretty , i'm not smart and i'm definitely not perfect .. I was dating this guy not even a month ago  and every time we seen each other your talked on the phone he would tell me all kinds of thing  like how beautiful i was , how smart i was and how perfect i was . sometimes i liked hearing him says those things to me but i knew it wasn't true so i told him that i wasn't beautiful and not even near perfect but he insisted  i was . so we broke up because i couldn't keep hearing how perfect he thought i was when i knew i wasn't 
-2	negative	bipolar-disorder	I'm not shopping for a woman on this site just here to vent and express myself. Just wanted to make that clear before I start.  That's what would really make me happy
-13	negative	bipolar-disorder	I'm not sure that I'm actually bipolar. I think my hospitalization several months ago prompted the diagnosis. I guess they figured that they HAD to add a diagnosis after what I had done. I haven't taken my bipolar meds in a while. It's not cost or anything like that, they just taste really freaking bad. I haven't had any issues with my mood at all, actually. It's not really that my mood changes, I told them that I just get so depressed that it makes me feel crazy. But that has always been the case. It's weird. I really hate having the diagnosis. It was enough to have PTSD on my chart. 
-6	negative	bipolar-disorder	 improving myself as much as I can and when I can  the more mistakes I make the more I'm fixing my self trying not to do it again. I always try to judge myself before I judge others  gotta keep that in mind 
-3	negative	bipolar-disorder	I'm shy. I've got scars. I've been heartbroken. I've lied. I've done things I'm NOT proud of. But I'm NOT perfect.
-3	negative	bipolar-disorder	Im so annoyed at my mum again! as mwntioned in previous bloody posts her total owing to me has GONE UP 100 DUE TO HER BEING SKINT AND TO MAKE IT WORSE ITS FRICKING OVERDRAWN IN MY ACCOUNT ALL OF IT SO IRRITATING! My sister then borrowed money from me too for a party, im like.. not like I have to fricking live! SO ANNOYING! ANYHOW NOW THEY ARE FIGHTING AND MUM WENT FOR MY SISTER. IT TOOK ALL MY STRENGTH NOT TO STOP HER! EURGGHH
-3	negative	bipolar-disorder	I'm so glad this group exists, and Im sure there are many more people out there who love looking at their old photos. That's why I love Polaroids - you can capture all these moments instantly. Digital cameras never really work for me, and I miss the feeling of waiting for my photos to be developed, and putting all of them in an album for later.  I miss the good old days :-) 
-3	negative	bipolar-disorder	I'm so sick of not being able to stay in control. Some days I'm fine others not so much. I'm dealing with it though. I just wish I could be normal. I make so many irrational decisions while being in a overly joyous mood. Or in a manic mood. I can hardly stand myself most of the times. It is taking over every aspect of my life. I just want to be normal and not have to take prescriptions to feel alright. It's so unfair it's not like I asked for this. I don't want this and I don't like the fact that it effects everything.
-1	negative	bipolar-disorder	Im usually a kick-back , a little high-maintenance and generous dude and i show respect to all cultures and ethnicities and still show respect to the people i dnt like :-) but when they tease me i let them carry on being a man taking a bullet aye Hahaha but then i get really annoyed and furious almost when they tease or trash my family so one time i said all these threatening stuff to this person and now.. After that i just noticed i hav a dark side ! we all do tbh .. but yeah im not mental haha x
-1	negative	bipolar-disorder	Im working toward being a better person. I love me ; Im working on it.
-5	negative	bipolar-disorder	In a previous story I discussed the dangers of remaining silent when a victim is confronted with bullying. Outcomes such as social anxiety, PTSD and even death are very likely when bullying is concerned. This time however I want to look at bullying from the bystanders perspective. As usual check out the full article @  Now updated daily on weekdays!
-7	negative	bipolar-disorder	including my mom.  I can't stand people, but I can't isolate myself from them because I have to work.  So I want to use people. So I was wondering how I can use everyone.  So far I use them for tiny things like entertainment.  So if you have ideas about how I can use them in bigger ways, that would be great.
-1	negative	bipolar-disorder	I need a gf. I want to experience a healthy grown relationship with a female. I've never been in one before. I feel like I'm missing out.
-3	negative	bipolar-disorder	I need to put my 16+ year old yellow lab to sleep, should I bring his best buddy, also a 3 year old lab, to the vet with us to be apart of putting him down so he is aware of what's happening, and so he knows why we didn't bring the old one home? or will he understand? Any thoughts on this will be appreciated.I am going to do this Tuesday. Pray I have the strength. I will see all of my animals in heaven. Scott
-23	negative	bipolar-disorder	I never once thought that I would be in this situation especially at my age. I met a man out one night. He was with a group of his friends. We started chatting and having a good time. I drove him back to his friend's house and we talked until 6:00 am in my truck. He told me that he was married and I told him that I understood and it was nice meeting him. He called me the next day to make sure I made it home ok and it started from there. We would talk and text and really enjoyed each other's company. He told me that he hadn't loved his wife for years but stayed because of his daughter's. We didn't sleep together for months until one night it happened. Since then it has been a weekly occurrence. His wife has found out about me and they went to therapy. I have ended it but he always comes back. I am getting to the point that I need something more and after a year and a half, I just don't see him leaving. I need to find the strength to leave but I just can't. 
-10	negative	bipolar-disorder	Initially I was diagnosed with depression and "adjustment disorder" but now when I think about how on a daily basis I am an "emotional roller coaster" and match up the symptoms of bipolar disorder. There is no doubt in my mind that this is what I'm suffering from. I've taken Zoloft for many years followed by Paxil and Wellbutrin. And none have helped these mood swings and suicidal thoughts go away. I laugh and cry in the same breath. And since my life is a shambles for the last 5 years I have 5-6 episodes a day where I can't stop myself or I'm thinking " if I had a rope would the beam above me support me hanging myself?
-3	negative	bipolar-disorder	In public  I am your typical 16 year old ..happy fun to be around  At home .. If you knew me you'd never talk to me again
-17	negative	bipolar-disorder	I once had a handsome face and a straight nose and a clear complexion. But "as they say" the things you neglect are the things you miss the most. I am a shattered person. I have never felt the same way since I found her in her bed. I live in the same place where mom died, I live with the memories everyday I am here.i cannot move on and put this tragedy past me because there are so many countless reminders, the whole building would have to be bulldozed and rebuilt to stop the pain that I feel living here. I feel like a mirror that has been shattered on many thousands of pieces. I have tried to put the pieces of what was my life back together only to have something come along and break the little I had fixed. My fourth and hopefully final suicide attempt will be successful. When I find a suitable airtight bag I can put on my head, I will take 90 pills of muscle relaxants,put the bag on my head and lay down in my bed. This world just is not for me to live in
-4	negative	bipolar-disorder	I plan to be the best I can be but I don't even know what I want to be..
-14	negative	bipolar-disorder	I question what my purpose really is.. Why am I still even here on this earth? How I act at school isn't who I am.. And how I act outside of school isn't really who I am.. So really WHO am I? I just want to be able to figure it all out and say "This is who I am" I'm tired of putting on a show for others at school just for them to belittle me behind my back. When I'm home I'm more to myself, but my parents think I'm this person who is so bad.. When I don't really do anything & obey the rules most of the time. I know my rights & my wrongs. But I don't know who I am.. One day, I'm hoping that I'll be able to love the person I was destined to be.
-3	negative	bipolar-disorder	I quit yesterday. I smoked about a pack and a half a day for like a year. My skin feels like it's on fire! Wish me luck!
-2	negative	bipolar-disorder	I recently came to realize that I am in fact a sociopath. I have lied, manipulated, hurt, and caused severe emotional damage to a lot of people. I don't feel remorse for any of it.  I'm excited for the next chapter. 
-11	negative	bipolar-disorder	I seriously need to change! Its one of my top greatest things I want to achieve this year. It may take a lot of time, but at least Im ready to do it. Im ready to face life. I want to get out from this isolation Ive been experiencing. I want to feel and see what life really is (of course, in a good way). I want to make my life exciting and fun. I want to laugh a lot because last year wasnt that good to me. I want to spend time with the people I knew and as well I want to meet new ones.  I want to do what my heart has been tellling me to do. I just want to be myself, to express myself naturally without any fear or pretentions. I hope and pray it'll happen before this year ends. May God be with me, always.
-3	negative	bipolar-disorder	I should get more sleep. But my roommate insists on keeping the lights on. So I took all the light bulbs and unplugged his tv
-2	negative	bipolar-disorder	I spent years of neglect in regards to my mental health. I was incapable of attending to myself because I lacked maturity and capacity. It would of been nice to have someone there for me. Even now, it would be nice to have someone here for me. I wish I have everything right and going within this year and/or before summer, 2014. 
-1	negative	bipolar-disorder	I stumbled upon this while cruising the Oatmeal website.theoatmeal.com/comics/tesla
-1	negative	bipolar-disorder	I survived  and much, much more
-2	negative	bipolar-disorder	I swear I'm going to be single for the rest of my life, lol.
-4	negative	bipolar-disorder	It brings me pleasure . Seeing the blood run down my arms and drip on the floor releases all the Anger and sadness for a split second . I am not ashamed of my scars nor am I proud of them but they remind me what I have made it through and that the pain goes away &lt;3
-4	negative	bipolar-disorder	It can scare me so  muchI am frightened by the way my mood changes and my different reactions.   One second I'll be all happy and cheery,then I'll become angry for no reason,then I'll start crying and become extremely sensitive,and at the end I'll just be all laughs and pretends it doesn't happen. My teachers keep dissing me for the mood swings saying I'm a needy little hysterical biatch. I am not! I always try to be my best me,but I sometimes loose control and I  just freak out peopleluckily people who know me mostly love me,and I am very grateful for my boyfriend for understanding me and still loving me unconditionally,and my mother,aunt and friends who stand next to me no matter what,as do I next to them.
-9	negative	bipolar-disorder	It happened at the beginning of last year. I haven't spoken to him since, and I'm convinced I'm better off without him. But even though he has his new girlfriend,  not a single day has gone by I haven't thought about him, Ama, or the life we could've had. But it's only Ama I miss, even though I never got to meet her. 
-4	negative	bipolar-disorder	I think everyone does but where there is good there must be evil. I think demons play a huge role in all the wrong done in the world today.
-5	negative	bipolar-disorder	I think everyone has a darkside, using it is the key. Sometimes in the dark is where it needs to stay!
-5	negative	bipolar-disorder	I think I am bipolar. The thought has been at the back of my mind for years. Now other people are starting to wonder too. Maybe I should go see a Dr. What would I even say though? 
-5	negative	bipolar-disorder	I think I have bi-polar . . . I said it to my mum and my counsellor both on separate occasions and they both seem to agree and both been thinking it for a while. I am not going to lie I am scared. I am going to the doctors in 2 hours and feeling very distressed 
-10	negative	bipolar-disorder	I think I'm a sociopath and it's going to cause me to lose the love of my life. Ever since I was little I was a compulsive liar, deceitful, and intelligent. My best friends growing up I lost because I told too many liesand it took me forever to realize that it was my fault. I've made and lost hundreds of relationships, and most of them I don't even remember. This one I don't want to be just a memory. I begged and pleaded to get him back, and in all honesty I've lied to him so much that he shouldn't have let me back in his life. Now he's falling in love with another woman, and this is my ultimatum. Either I sort myself out and learn to keep myself in check, or I'll spend the rest of my life wondering why I couldn't. Somebody, please help me. 
-4	negative	bipolar-disorder	I think it's sad (out loud) but secretly love that I smile to your face but imagine you being hit by a bus or head exploding! I can never really hide my anger or hatred, so I smile. I work with so many assholes! I'm married to a slug! I smile!
-4	negative	bipolar-disorder	I think most people have a dark side it's just finding your dark side. I see my dark side not as evil but a kind of second me that occasionally comes out in things I do in life eg some of my music tastes.
-2	negative	bipolar-disorder	I think sleep is my part time suicide
-1	negative	bipolar-disorder	I think that everybody have a dark side; sometimes I feel caught in this  indifferent system
-5	negative	bipolar-disorder	It hurts so muchloosing people to suicide is so hurtful and confusing all I want to do is scream "why!"he was only 16 years oldhe decided to jump in front of a train 2 weeks agohe was the middle child and I used to babysit all of the kids when they were in grade schoolwe are all hurting right nowtoday is the memorial serviceim so angry inside.
-7	negative	bipolar-disorder	It is said that we are tallest at the beginning of the day; that our spines are stretched out and relaxed at night and as the day goes on our bodies compress and slouch. I can feel my bones fold under the weight of my body. Every sigh allows more stress to push down on my shoulders, and I end up inches shorter than I was when I awoke.  But I believe it can be possible to in fact grow taller, despite the regretful scientific fact. I want to will myself to lift my chest and raise my eyes off the ground where they've been stuck, and march slowly, proudly, up.
-2	negative	bipolar-disorder	It kinda consumes me, but I like the way it feels to be honest. 
-10	negative	bipolar-disorder	i tried about 5 times already. the first two times were because of bullies. the next two were because i just gave up on life.  the last one was for two reasons first reason i fought with my parents on that night and the second reason was because i was just hurting  in more ways than one so i just wanted to end it all.
-2	negative	bipolar-disorder	I try not to let myself ever go thereit aint nothing nice.
-10	negative	bipolar-disorder	I try not to think of my dark side.  It really scares me and I have little too no control over it.  I have these thoughts always somewhere in my head.  It usually involves me or someone else, getting hurt.  The one last time I showed my dark side was about 8 years ago. I'm now somewhat of a pacifist now.  I try not to show my emotions and try to avoid any and all conflict.  It's worked so far.  But I know that one day that I will explode, and when that time comes, I might hurt someone that I'll care about.
-3	negative	bipolar-disorder	I try to be a good person, I really do. I'm the type of guy that will feed a stray kitten and turn in a wallet full of cash. But sometimes I really don't want to. It's our decisions that tell us who we are, not what we are capable of doing.
-12	negative	bipolar-disorder	I try to be a nice guy, I really do. I listen when someone needs a friend to talk to, and I like to help when I can. I have had a rough life, but it's taught me a lot and I enjoy sharing what I know with those who want or need it. Almost everyone I meet thinks I'm a good guy. It's a monster, a creature of pure passion and impulse that knows no love or compassion for anyone or thing. The Beast only cares about its own selfish lusts and desires, and it hates everyone. It wants to suffer and to punish the world at the same time, for the sin of allowing me to be born.
-11	negative	bipolar-disorder	I try to be nice and happy but my past haunts me. I have made mistakes that have hurt people but I honestly never truly intend to. At least I can acknowledge when I've done wrong, unlike most people I know. My past still haunts me, I have gone through much more than the average person my age. I've had to be mature at young ages. But it made me who I am, and id never change that if I could.
-4	negative	bipolar-disorder	It's been one and a half years, and I still don't want to believe it. I lost my best friend of ten years to an overdose in October 2011. She had been hospitalized a few weeks before and we (her family and I) thought she had turned a corner. If you have someone in your life struggling, keep them close. Every conversation could be the last.
-2	negative	bipolar-disorder	It's fun and now this is longer than 25 characters
-9	negative	bipolar-disorder	It's his birthday again. Last year at this time I remember our feast at home, celebrating his 67th and last birthday. Now that he's been gone for 11 months. When I was in my room surfing the net I heard my grandma playing the Happy Birthday song on the piano. I was astonished. She never remembers her own birthday when she remembers her husband's. Sorrow in my heart Grandpa is my most beloved relative and he brought me up, and I just want him to come back. :-(
-1	negative	bipolar-disorder	It's just burdening somehow. I never let anyone knows my true self, i keep everything for my own. And i dont think anyone can stand with me for a long time, because im not good enough, and im afraid to disappoint others. I always pretend to look cheerful and confident in front of people, in fact i always feel inferior and vulnerable.  I sometimes think that i'd better live alone than having the chance to disappoint my partner. Please help me anyone. I really want to change. Am i helpless already?
-9	negative	bipolar-disorder	It's like I have split personality.. I can be laughing one minute in a good mood, someone will annoy me(over something stupid) and then something clicks in my brain where I just want to murder everyone to the point my eyes go bloodshot,cause I'm suppressing it.. Just sat there slyly gazing at them visioning myself killing them in different ways and they don't have a clue lol I'm strong minded though for controlling my urges cause I know it will pass.
-1	negative	bipolar-disorder	its unhealthy, but i just do :D not much of a story i know 
-4	negative	bipolar-disorder	Its very hard for me to learn to love myself. Only now being 22 I finally started to feel more or less ok with myself but I still have a long way to go to fully accepting myself just way I am. 
-5	negative	bipolar-disorder	It takes time for the wounds to be covered. Loss of a dear loved one causes so much of pain. Someone who has always cared for you and was willing to go all the way so that you will be happy. Time only passes but the does not healTime only takes away the momentary loss but the loss returns, as always.
-11	negative	bipolar-disorder	It took me 10 years to get diagnosed with Bipolar II Disorder because the hypomania episodes were so short and subtle; from the time I was a teenager into young adulthood I tried every SSRI and SNRI antidepressant except Wellbutrin and nothing worked or the side effects were too unpleasant.  As I got older and had a lot more stress with a husband, daughter and nursing career I noticed more moodiness and depression that led to terrible fatigue.  In the end it was a psych nurse practitioner who correctly diagnosed me and after a lot of med changes I found Lamictal and am a changed woman 
-1	negative	bipolar-disorder	It was a shock, to say the least. I hope you've found your peace, Dad. xo
-3	negative	bipolar-disorder	It was Feburary 2003.  Sometimes I wish she wouldn't have found me on the deck. Sometimes I'm glad she did.
-18	negative	bipolar-disorder	It was middle school 6th grade when I met him and 8th grade when we started dating. Becoming a senior in high school is when I lost him forever. He was on his way to pick me up then it happen, he was hit by a semi truck. The next two years I spiraled out of control then finally put myself together last year. I've actually met someone almost exactly like him except the way he looks. And the weird thing it's the date we got together is the same date as my first lover. I've been questioning myself if I should move on and I'm almost sure it's time. I'm ready. I left a lot of detail out but I needed to get this of my chest.
-4	negative	bipolar-disorder	I used to be afraid of being taken advantage of so I used to separate myself emotionally by imagining my closest friends being tortured to death, then for every time I've been cheated on I mapped out and plotted the murder of my partners however every day I fight through these thoughts and I thank God I can!
-1	negative	bipolar-disorder	I used to be a good guy who loved to help people. Being real has too many down falls. Y'all don't enjoy me good side?! We'll let's let lucifer take the wheel, and give you a taste of the darkness shall we!? Strap in your booster seats! It's gunna be a bumpy ride!!!
-9	negative	bipolar-disorder	I used to be very independent, sure of anything, happy, brave. 17 yrs of marriage to a controlling angry man destroyed that strength. I somehow lost myself. for a long time. I am now on the move to take my life back. I now know what I want and who I should be. Everyone deserves to be free to be themselves and be happy. I am picking up my mat to walk stand tall and celebrate Life!!!
-19	negative	bipolar-disorder	I used to have confidence.  I used to laugh, crack up, be the life of the party! My husband has finally won! He has verbally abused me and has called me every filthy discussing name he can think. Just today he called me every immaniginable  name. This is the only tip! He travels for his job. Withhold all of his business info.  Goes bar hopping. Makes lots of female friends. Drinks and dances until the wee hours of dawn! He goes to prostitutes in China and of course , gets Happy Endings.  Anything I try to do positive with my life , he puts it down! Church , volunteering thru schools. Any thing I try to do that makes me feel good he takes the wind outta my sails.  We are both 53.  I'm not sure why he's so ugly with me. His Mom suffers from Mental Illness and I'm afraid he's acting just like her.  I'm so miserable.  I fantasize about dying everyday. 
-13	negative	bipolar-disorder	I used to love my family and not just because their are my family and then my grandma died and I stopped loving them I only pretend to. I'm not a family person anymore. For the winter break I'm with my moms baby sister and I hate because I put all my family love into my best friend and now I feel so weird being with my own family! I can't even open the fridge without asking, but when I'm at my friends I open the fridge like it's no big deal! I just want to hang out with my real family!
-6	negative	bipolar-disorder	I use to be so shy I refused to talk to anyone I didn't like people. I hated hugging people. I was usually alone. In middle school I spoke a bit except I was still alone. I hate talking to people because I had no idea what to say. But in high school I changed somehow I like hugging people I'm a bit annoying and childish I'm still shy I'm more open now I don't know what happen
-9	negative	bipolar-disorder	I use to have really bad anger issues, I would get mad so easily and just smash up anything I could find. I bust up my knuckles by punching a wall and damaged my hand by slamming it against the floor. I would smash up furniture with hammers or bats, scream my head off, even hurt and punch myself. I isolated myself because I was scared I was goin to hurt them.  I would see this girl a lot that told me to hurt people, I would just be sitting in lunch with my friends and I would see her pretending to strangle someone and I would just laugh at her not realising no one else could see her. I thought she was real.
-1	negative	bipolar-disorder	I've always been drawn to the broken people, the flock of lost birds that squawk, but don't understand the space they occupy. I have an exceptional finesse for weakness(I'm sure most of us do) and define the aberrations in their personality. I don't always act on these details because it will make me look very bad. I don't think I'm negative, I am very perceptive and linger more on defects than the positive aspects. For that reason, I romantically call closest friends my "lost birds"(also because of a special life event). Perhaps, I found a connection.Feels deep, foreign, strange.
-3	negative	bipolar-disorder	Ive been trying to starve myself recently, but it's been so hard for me! I can't stop eating and I wish I had some self control. I just want to be skinny really bad. I hate how my thighs touch. Let me just say that I'm not over weight. I'm 130 which is good for my height and age, but it's not good enough for me. Any tips on how to not be hungry or to have more self control?
-4	negative	bipolar-disorder	I've had bits of happiness, and bits of my life that honestly haven't been that great. But I am convinced that if I take each day as a new one and face things with optimism, I am on the right path.
-6	negative	bipolar-disorder	I've never liked cocaine much. Don't get me wrong, it feels good and I don't turn it down if I get it for free. But it really doesn't do that much for me. Amphetamin and exstasy are fantastic drugs, but coke?. not my cup of tea. I've wondered why, cause everyone else just loves it. But I think it comes down to my unique personality disposition. And therefor I would like to ask if any of you frequenters of this fine group feel the same, or have some light you could shed on this topic?    Yeah I feel that way toofrom the moment I wake up in the morning. Why should I pay good money for something that I already have? No, I'd take a bottle of good bourbon or scotch over a bag of Charlie anytime.
-9	negative	bipolar-disorder	I've pushed away everyone in some way or another. I take so many "meds" it's insane. Sometimes I feel hopeless, like there's no way out. When I feel that way, I'm very very close to ending my life. Other times I look outside and see the sun shining and thank God I'm alive. Other times my mind races like I've done a line of coke and I won't eat or sleep for days simply because I don't need it and I couldn't even if I wanted to. I hold so much of this inside that no one really knows how hard it is for me. I wish I could find the right words to make them understandto make you understand. I just want out.
-2	negative	bipolar-disorder	I've taken many tests online, and they all say Im extremely bipolar, but I don't want to tell my family. I just don't want them to think like I'm a different person  
-17	negative	bipolar-disorder	I Want to be the Bad Guy- I have a job, one that I won't disclose. At this job i ran into an old friend and met his friend, fresh out of a four year tour as a Marine. I considered being a Marine a long time. Its glamorous to make it back in one piece, a tough, mysterious killer. I asked him if he had ever killed. He said "Over a dozen." I didnt feel weird, upset, proud. I felt jealousy. Not that I love the idea of killing. It was a natural impulse. I was jealous of his story. I wanted one. My favorite movie is Falling Down, series? Breaking Bad. Both masterpieces, both remarkably similar. About men with real stories to tell. Men who had adventures, men who fought, men who died like men. That's what I wanted. I want to die a young hero. Or an aging villain.
-2	negative	bipolar-disorder	I want to break out of the shell. I want to be me.
-1	negative	bipolar-disorder	I want to make a Suicide Pact
-5	negative	bipolar-disorder	I want to torture someone. I want to work on their body, get the gist of their beauty. I thought about perhaps sedating them because I want to see them witness themselves be torn. Pull their intestines, snip an artery, poke a kidney, slather their blood, inject their eyes with paint, anything. 
-4	negative	bipolar-disorder	I want you to hold me close and tell me this is real. Kiss my blood stained wrists and say the cuts will heal.
-4	negative	bipolar-disorder	I was abused by my mother she kicked me out of the house im living with my dad ! And im falling behind i dnt have a job or money or school ! My dream is to go to therapy and be a nurse in the future ! I have anxiety disorder by smoking weed my ex bf peer pressure me to smoke with him !
-9	negative	bipolar-disorder	I was always emotional as a child, prone to extreme fits of rage and depression. I attempted suicide in 8th grade. It wasn't until I was 21 yrs old and in the hospital that I was diagnosed with Bipolar II. 5 years later the way I view myself has changed, I question everything I do. I was hypomanic during the week I took the Law School Admission Test (LSAT) and have continued to suffer bouts of depression, self-injury, and hypomania. I am glad I foud this place to speak openly about it since all my friends think I am just moody.
-5	negative	bipolar-disorder	I was a physically abused child but as a child I was smart kind shy but helpful And I was hoping if someone could tell me whether it's got to do with my abusive past or if it's just me going through a phase
-10	negative	bipolar-disorder	I was bullied from fifth grade through eighth grade and I'm not sure why. Everyone runs away and tells secrets about me in groups. I come up to the group, and they all shut up and run away. I never did anything to them. I stood alone and went to a different high school than the rest of them. I'm happier then I've ever been. I have a great group of friends and am now a sophomore. I know that people accept me. For the other people, eh, they're just weak.
-9	negative	bipolar-disorder	I was clenching my fists, gritting my teeth, but I was staring at the person before me. I had a smile on, a little crooked, my anger was sizzling. He left. And as much as I wanted to spill it out, I resisted, and scurried to the bathroom sprayed some water. I would feel good. I know. So I looked into my eyes and saw that person again, on my own face. I had no identity, but that person's. Greed? Lust?Hate? Did it matter? He would be gone.  
-5	negative	bipolar-disorder	I was diagnosed with BPD a year ago. And my wife left because because i was "too much to handle". As someone who just experienced BPD, i had a hard time understanding what it was. I saw a psychiatrist couple of times and took meds couple of months then i stop. What should i do?
-20	negative	bipolar-disorder	I was diagnosed with PTSD in 2009 after I was shot by my ex boyfriend and then watched him kill himself. I was one of those people who believed only soldiers could get something like that. Boy was I ever wrong I have nightmares, sweats, daymares ( lol ), insomnia, anger with no cut off point. The list could really go on. I never really knew how bad it was until I started seeing my ex everywhere, everything people said were like words coming out of his mouth. I replayed that night countless times. I became another personI haven't been the same since. The person I am now is ready to battle the world if I have to. I think I'm mad all the time. I do have problems being at home alone and in places alone full of strangers. At times I feel like one of my children, needing someone to hold their hand. I constantly think and feel like someone is after me. There is not a day that goes by that I don't. I've enrolled in college, but my daily battle isn't going to let me go I don't belive.
-3	negative	bipolar-disorder	I was happily married with lovely 10 months daughter, I have bipolar disorder which is sever mood change from being energetic and full of life to severely depressed, I been on medication since I was diagnosed with it since I was 17, during those long years I didn't experience depression like the one I have now since my wife left and took my daughter with her after her family told her that I am a mentally ill which is not true. she was the love of my life and my daughter was the energy I needed to keep going in life but suddenly I lost both of them, that's when I lost my motivation to fight , it has been almost 2 years now but every day I feel it is getting worse. Now I live in complete isolation just alone and sad, I am losing every thing even my social relations, I hate that feeling but I really can't fight any more. I need a friend, some one to give me a hand as I really need my life back.
-4	negative	bipolar-disorder	I was hurt after coming out of the closet. Beaten and insulted, went home, got the belt, wussed out. Happened a few times. I gave up and made friends. I'm better but still feel it from time to time.
-7	negative	bipolar-disorder	I was left at a very young age by my mother and was never shown the proper kind of love growing up which caused me to develop abandonment issues over the years which causes me to cling to people unknowingly. I try so hard not to ever feel left again that I just push the people I want to be close to away. I feel myself doing that to a guy I just met that I find very interesting. I just keep telling myself to take it easy, not everyone is out to hurt me. I really hope this works out.
-3	negative	bipolar-disorder	I was sitting around recently and I got to thinking and came to one conclusion: It must be rough to be a moderator on a large social media or forum ba It's at the bottom of the front page!
-5	negative	bipolar-disorder	I was very conflicted with myself at one point in my life. My heart believed in one thing and my mind chased another. For some reason my mind kept winning the tug of war. I began to feel numb My heart seemed to be missing in the equation. After a series of events unfolded. Then My heart began to beat again
-8	negative	bipolar-disorder	I was walking down the street a little girl bumped into me and she kep on staring at me and I asked r u ok then she started cried and she ran.then I asked wat did I do
-5	negative	bipolar-disorder	I will expand on this later but my old friend passed away while I was in the room. 2nd the nursing home where he was has either stolen or discarded certain items in less than week after the death. Make this a rule NEVER GO INTO A HOME, ask to be put down or commit suicide. 
-2	negative	bipolar-disorder	I woke with little sleep, head ache, have difficulty sometimes differing this bpd, from cold flu aches ect. Today I'm strong enough to choose Wellness over illness!! 
-1	negative	bipolar-disorder	I would always feel a sense of shame whenever I remembered. So now I breathe a heavy sigh, It's best not to dwell on this longer than is necessary else I lose myself in the dark corridors of my shame.
-2	negative	bipolar-disorder	I wrote this poem yesterday. I might ask to read it at my grandfathers funeral. Goodbye
-5	negative	bipolar-disorder	Jan. 15. Standing Up for Ourselves. We learn some behaviors have self-defeating consequences, while others have beneficial consequences. We learn we have choices. From The Language of Letting Go by Melody Beattie 1990, Hazelden Foundation.
-5	negative	bipolar-disorder	Just having a wee freak out here. It's not unusual, it mainly happens when I am tired or stressed. But they are panic attacks that I feel like a scared squirming worm on the end of a hook at the moment.  I writhe as I try to type. It's horrible. I wasn't looking for answers, I just had to say it or at least type it out as I am alone in the dark. I will be fine in a bit but I had to get this out. Blahblahnlah blah!!!!! I am worried this scared side of me will bring out the rest of them.
-10	negative	bipolar-disorder	Just recently I found out my friend died of a O.D on heroin. I had just seen him like 5 days before he left this Earth. He was trying to get clean but relapsed. He went in to the hospital and after being there for only the night they sent him home. He died the next day. It's sad and he'll be missed. This is the 3rd person I've known in the past year die from that drug. I've never done it and don't want to do it.
-3	negative	bipolar-disorder	Just went through a break up and I've never longed for revenge so bad, and at face value I did nothing , but in time she will realize what i destroyed and half she will never realize. No ones time should ever be wasted and moments can never be restored . Eye for an eye .I laugh at her undiscovered pain.
-18	negative	bipolar-disorder	Last Christmas, I watched someone I love pass away in front of my eyes. I had a special relationship with her and I was glad I was with her for her last moments here on earth but the memory of her dying continues to run though my brain on a daily basis. No one understand what I went through. We were on the way to the hospital when she died. She said she wasn't feeling good. I didn't expect what would happen next. All of a sudden I saw her body went limp and mucus came out of her mouth as her head tilted to the side. I tried to frantically call 911 while hysterically crying and trying to hold her up. Ive never told anybody my experience but I feel I need to get it off my chest especially because it is the holiday season. Everyone says they can't wait for Christmas but how can I enjoy Christmas when I watched someone I loved pass away a year before on the very same day? And how can you let someone go that you felt so connected to? I couldn't imagine my life without her yet here I am.
-7	negative	bipolar-disorder	Life is getting better by the day. I understand that I will not be able to alter some aspect of my personality to be happy. The notion that I could change for the better is utter nonsense. If I continue to try and 'fix' myself, or come to terms with who I am, I will forever struggle with the emotional issues that plagued my life thus far. I have always been manipulating my reality to fit my needs, only now I am aware of it. And it sure is exhilarating
-1	negative	bipolar-disorder	Like being a brat when I was a child
-1	negative	bipolar-disorder	like fire is causing me to sin
-1	negative	bipolar-disorder	Like the moon, its all dark I will raise the tide and wash you all away.
-2	negative	bipolar-disorder	lol you could say that, sometimes this curious panda, turns into a dragon 0_0
-1	negative	bipolar-disorder	Look at me now and you'll never guess. What makes me whole only proves I am less. What you think you may see, isn't entirely me.  or watch it burn
-8	negative	bipolar-disorder	Looking outward for love felt so wrong ~ when I realize youve been here with me all along  Till the day we meet again ~ Ill be waiting right here for you ~ where I have always been
-1	negative	bipolar-disorder	may christmas be over soon.
-1	negative	bipolar-disorder	me?!   of course not!!! :D
-8	negative	bipolar-disorder	Most people find me to be a little innocent and really kind (or so I've been told) but if someone gets me mad or hurts someone around me I snap. I would yell a lot and would get really annoyed. People say I'm totally different when I'm mad because I don't talk in the high pitched voice I have and it makes me scary
-2	negative	bipolar-disorder	Most people seem to think I am sweet and innocent. Those are the people I hardly talk to. My close friends know that I am not sweet and innocent, but they don't know everything. I don't think they know how dark I can be.
-12	negative	bipolar-disorder	Most people think I am crazy :3, but that is okay, because they just don't understand. Most the time, I am  wacky, fun, fun, fun! I love to laugh, and smile, and give hugs! Then, other times, i get really sad, and all of my fun time flowers wilt. Then I cry, and get angry, because I get scared. Then I lose control and hurt things that I don't want to hurt. And I can't control it. And it is so scary. It feels helpless, and dark, and lonely. And I scream, but it seems like no one hears me. And I feel like I have to hide from people, because no one loves dark and gloomy me. That is when they call me crazy. But that is okay, because they don't understand. Because I am me, both sides! And I stay strong, even during the scary bits! Because it is my life, and I want to be happy, even if I fall down and trip time to time. :3
-6	negative	bipolar-disorder	Most perceive me as this sweet little girl that has a constant smile on her face. But if you take the time to get to know me, you'll quickly discover that I can be extremely sarcastic and have a dark sense of humor. I'm usually a super nice and friendly person, so one would never guess the wicked thoughts that cross my mind.
-1	negative	bipolar-disorder	mums in hospital atm im not sure how many more there will be of this
-4	negative	bipolar-disorder	My aunt has terminal bone cancer. The Dr. said she might live a week - two weeks tops. There is no christmas miracle for her.
-6	negative	bipolar-disorder	My beautiful husky was just 3 years old when she died. I was out of town for medical reasons and our husky is known to jump a lot so we took her to a pet day care center where we told them she loved to jump and they said don't worry we can handle it, and what happens they lose her and she ends up getting hit by a car. She was everything she was such a loving dog! I miss her.
-2	negative	bipolar-disorder	My bipolar is thoroughly boring. I'm either depressed or more depressed. However, this year the solution is at hand. Prozac and Pepsi MAX together make me 20% better. And 20% is all I need!
-3	negative	bipolar-disorder	My Boyfriend broke up with me yesterday because I smoke weed and because I'm hard too handle I've never felt so broken
-2	negative	bipolar-disorder	My boyfriend was recently diagnosed with bipolar disorder. Its been so tough on me also. How do you ladies deal with your bf who's also been diagnosed?
-6	negative	bipolar-disorder	My brother has been bullied all through his years in school and me being older, I hated never being able to do anything about it. I just honestly never understood why my brother never did anything about it. I mean i'm sure he was half the kid's size. He would always just say he didn't want to be like they were. He's a good kid and people who bully need to open their eyes and realize that the attitude they have isn't going to get them anywhere in life..
-1	negative	bipolar-disorder	My cuts are burning but that's ok. I can feel again 
-8	negative	bipolar-disorder	My dad feels like a stranger to me. My parents split up when I was a baby and I never understood why I was kept from my dad growing up. Every time me and mum had a fight a would bring up my dad and how I wanted to know him/live with him and not her Finally as a young teenager (about 5 years ago now) mum accompanied me to go meet my dad for the first time in ages, what was the point.. Why did I put my mum through that? I found out my dad was abusive and many other reasons why he was not part of my life and it sucks! My older sister has talked to my dad for over 5years and even though he is dead to me it makes me wish I had a dad  is anyone else in the same situation Where they hate their dad for what they put the family through but still wish they had a dad figure?? 
-5	negative	bipolar-disorder	My dark side has a mind of its own and it wants what it wants when it wants it.                         That's right, fudge AND ice cream Mmm ;p
-7	negative	bipolar-disorder	My dark side is expressed through my sense of humor, I usually cant refrain from telling dark jokes and kind of messed up jokes, people usually find it funny though and so they befriend me and it helps toward being social. Sometimes I say a dark thing through my sense of humor but I actually mean it and no one can tell.
-2	negative	bipolar-disorder	My dark side is I want my virginity taken by my brother..
-1	negative	bipolar-disorder	My dark side is just a bit of an ego that takes on a stride when in public. I put it on just to entertain people. No harm, is done, its all good fun
-2	negative	bipolar-disorder	My dark side is that I get in fights with my mom all the time.
-7	negative	bipolar-disorder	My dark side never got to come out and play like it very well could have. Seriously, I went through depressing crap as a teenager, and I got pretty fed up with it all. At some point, I decided not to lash out at the world around me, but to focus my anguish inwards. From what I've done to myself, physically and mentally, I know that I could have seriously hurt some people. Perhaps even more. That is a terrifying train of thought for me. To know that, if I had made the wrong choice, I could have really hurt people. Just who would I have become? As cynical as I am, I can't stand to hurt people.
-4	negative	bipolar-disorder	my daughter committed suicide and I miss her soooooo much don't know why she didn't come to me . She recently had a birthday and the pain is unbearable I want to be with her although I have 3 other children she was the only one I could talk to. I missssss her sooooo much help me .
-3	negative	bipolar-disorder	My dear Kara, love and miss you very much!  Knowing your in the arms of Jesus draws me!!  It's been three years to date (12/1 and little did Taylor Swift know that her words in her song  
-1	negative	bipolar-disorder	My eyes had shined bright  This world of pitch black.
-5	negative	bipolar-disorder	My father abused my mother all through my childhood until she finally left him after CAS threatened to take us away, I have no tolerance for abuse, not just men hitting women but women hitting men as well abuse can go both ways, both is wrong.
-3	negative	bipolar-disorder	My first friends name was Kayla.. She passed away on November 8, 2008 (3 days after my 11th birthday) from cancer which she had been battling for several years. &lt; 3
-9	negative	bipolar-disorder	My Friend's Father is Dying. I have a friend. We met once, but really only know each other through email. She is perhaps the nicest person I know. She is in Europe taking care of her father who is dying of cancer. The end is very near now.  I am sad for her.
-5	negative	bipolar-disorder	My grandmother seems doesn't like me but everyone said she is just like that don't care what she's doing she's just want u to be good. But no ever since I go out a lot or don't help any works in the house she begins to yelling at me in very little mistakes I do. Hmmmm but her sons she doesn't do like what she had done to me!  am so sad cuz I love with her not my parents!!!
-5	negative	bipolar-disorder	my great grandmother passed away in 2005, and a couple of years later so did my great grandfather, soon afterward pennies started to show up in the oddest places, on the middle of the couch cushion, a freshly cleaned floor, in my brothers hat, even on my pillow. the pennies are always face up, and are either new or extremely shiny
-4	negative	bipolar-disorder	My heart is broken because I had to let him go I didn't want to hurt him. I knew I have 6 more days left and really don't want to hurt the people I love. It's so close. 
-6	negative	bipolar-disorder	My husband has been using for a long time behind my back but lately it's gotten out of control. He takes all our money, his mood will give you whiplash, he disappears at night in my car with no drivers license. We have 3 beautiful babies together. I've seen too many go down this path, ruin their lives and those around them. I've avoided that life like the plague so how did I end up married to a drug user?? 
-7	negative	bipolar-disorder	My life is so frustrating right now. I am in a relatonship . but i have a lot of sad feelings because of my partner who cheat and lies regularly when he goes to other country. Then when he come back he is the person who love me the most.  Please advice me how person like me can change my life.
-2	negative	bipolar-disorder	My mask grows daily. I constantly experiment with different personalities. I determine which characteristics are most effective for generating a public persona by stealing personality attributes from a host of people(co-workers, "friends", celebrities, etc) and mix and match them until I have created the "Perfect Suit". 
-5	negative	bipolar-disorder	My mom has bpd. I didn't realize until just this year (I'm 1. Recently she cut me me off emotionally and kicked me out of her house due to a new boyfriend. Yes, I made her life difficult with my own bpd tendencies, and I can't help but feel it's my fault and question myself and my self esteem is horrible and worsening by the day. I've been doing risky things lately because of it. I think I'm developing bulimia, I abuse any drugs I can get my hands on, and I've been pushing away almost all my friends and finding "friends" in the wrong people. I have social anxiety as it is, but now it's to the point I can't attend school. I've been hospitalized for depression before, and I just don't know if it's a good idea right now but I know I do need help and outpatient therapy isn't seeming to do it. I was doing really well, but the thing with my mom really devastated me and I just feel unnable to cope. What do you all suggest I do?
-15	negative	bipolar-disorder	My mother has bi-polar disorder she has been in and out of mental treatment over the years since I was a teen. She has been using alcohol to self medicate. It has been a roller coaster of emotions dealing with her. Being the oldest I have often had to parent my parent. My mom and I have had a strained relationship because of her lack of care of her mental welfare. I love my mother I wish our relationship would be better, but I don't see that happening until she begins to follow up with doctors and get the medical help she needs. It is nice to know I am not alone in this and it is nice to read your stories here it encourages me to continue forward with my mom and not cut her off even though it is tempting at times because of the stress she causes me. My hat goes off to those who struggle with a parent who has mental illness it is not easy at all. 
-3	negative	bipolar-disorder	My mother passed on 08/14/13 this past Wednesday . This morning as I was walking up the steps to my office I found a penny on heads..  who knew that a penny could bring so much joy! 
-9	negative	bipolar-disorder	My parents are overprotective. Besides family, I never met a kid my own age until i entered kindergarten. I didn't know how to act around people my own age, but I did well around the kids labelled as weird. They say that I acted like a storybook character, which has some merit to it, since all I ever did was read stories. Books are where I learned social skills from. It's just so easy to be by myself.
-1	negative	bipolar-disorder	My past is today, right now, this very second and I'm going to try my best to make it good.
-3	negative	bipolar-disorder	My purpose here, is 2 leave this place a better place than when I came n 2 it. B all u can b, CUZ u don't get a 2nd chance @ life!!
-2	negative	bipolar-disorder	My relationship of 3 years isnt at all working i've tried everything to make it work but nothing What must i do to move on with my life??? ( there's a baby involved)
-1	negative	bipolar-disorder	my son died 01/06/13 I miss him so much still cant believe it and think about him constantly he was 21 years old just starting out in his adult life ,I am truly devastated do not know how I will cope with how I feel, I need him back. He died in his sleep not having been ill we now have an inquest to endure.
-14	negative	bipolar-disorder	My story takes me back a long back. We were friends - she and I. We shared everything. Laughs, smiles, walks, poetry. It took one night to change everything. She said to me she wanted to party with her boyfriend and their circle of friends. Her words that night stuck to me "I love you sweetie. Never change. For me." When I got a call in the middle of the night from her dad, my heart just broke. She was in a tragic car accident. She didn't survive. At her funeral, I held her cold, lifeless hand and said "I love you. I will never change. For you." &lt;3
-2	negative	bipolar-disorder	My voice is shaky My eyes are red Tears are pouring inside But your day will come The day you die And I shall not forgive you
-3	negative	bipolar-disorder	My wife is bipolar. She can not work because of the side effects of all her meds. She is also constantly dealing with one physical issue after another. For the last few years it's been chronic bladder pain. Not to take anything away from what she's going through (because I've been there through it all for more than 10 years) but some times I feel like my entire world revolves around her medical issues. And that world feels small and lonely.
-2	negative	bipolar-disorder	My wrist looks ugly again! Ffs I just can't continue leaving this way 
-7	negative	bipolar-disorder	Next week I am leaving Berlin, a beautifal house, a caring boyfriend and cat, also a job. I am going back to the UK to get free health care as I am from there and as I am too ill after my suicidal self I am in able to hold down a well enough paid job that would cover my therapy on health insurence. I'm so worried my bf will leave me and everything I have created here will feel like I have wasted! I'm so sad I have been crying every night and hurting my self. It's been a big stain on my relationship and I'm worried.
-2	negative	bipolar-disorder	No More. They told me to make the story longer.
-4	negative	bipolar-disorder	no one knows I intend to keep it that way that's why there are two ep accounts I don't even want strangers to know lol
-4	negative	bipolar-disorder	No one needs me here. Not even those closest to me. Why would they? Who would want or need me around? I don't smell good. I look like a monster. No one likes me. You can do anything to me. I'm not smart. I'm none as the one who just sits up and talks crazy or about things no one knows what I'm talking about. When I do talk, the only thing people listen for is what off the wall crazy thing will I say. I don't understand life or anything the way most people do. 
-3	negative	bipolar-disorder	. Not with my friends. We don't bicker, we don't fight. I've lost too many to worry about the little things. There is always a possibility of them or me dying tomorrow, so I always leave a door open for them. I know this because between the ages of 13 and 15, two of my friends were killed. So you could say it changed my perspective on friendship. 
-4	negative	bipolar-disorder	Now, losing a best friend or loved one is not something we usually like to sit around and think about. It's a touchy subject for most, and a lot of us can agree that we don't feel the need to worry about this because it seems like it would never happen. However, it can happen at any given day and moment. It happened to me. That's right, my best friend passed away. When you lose a best friend or a close one, the pain never really goes away, it just fades. The memories never die. My experience has taught me to appreciate every single loved one and friends as much as I possibly can. Take no one for granted and let them know they are truly loved, because you never know when they can suddenly be taken away from you. Thank you for taking the time to read this. &lt;3 ~Kiara
-4	negative	bipolar-disorder	Now that I have given some light to my own feelings, I thought I would write about the feelings of others and how I respond. This is confusing, and I'm bored and need to sleep.
-4	negative	bipolar-disorder	Oh baby, oh babyThen it fell apart, it fell apart.   Oh baby, oh babyThen it fell apart, it fell apart.  Excerpt from "Extreme Ways" by Moby
-7	negative	bipolar-disorder	Ok, I will not lie, I'm not a serial killer, but I have a dark side. I will not go into how it was created, and why it exists at all, but it's there, just under the skin. Few people know about it, those who have experienced it. My parents, my friend Danny. They know what it looks like and how scary. As I said, I'm not drowning kittens in the neighborhood. But i entirely change. I have one, as they say, a frightening look. Something in my eyes is changing. Becomes evil. Then I become senseless, psychopath, I can not control my actions. I never do incredibly evil things, but I could. When i really want to.Under such tantrums can not really control myself. And afterwards i do not remember anything
-3	negative	bipolar-disorder	Ok so my names Tayla i have several different personalities im usualy crazy and outgoing and will do something cazy even if i get hurt. Im a good off. Other times i am concentrated on school or cleaning. Im thinking about college even thiugh im over 5 yers away. Im a memoryhollic so i take tonnnnsss of pictures. Im sometimes quite and have wise info. Sometimes im competitive and rough. Others i would do anything for anyone! Even if ididnt know somebody and hated them i would die for them son thats just a few of my sides
-3	negative	bipolar-disorder	One day I decided I would play one of my favorite games called Messing with Mom. 
-8	negative	bipolar-disorder	One side - what I believe to be my true self - sees the best in everything and everyone. I love animals (both my good side and dark side), I give to the poor, I am there as a friend to those who are bullied, I stand up for justice wherever I can and I am generally a man of good principles.  So, there is my personality dichotomy. Now I just have to find a way to let my dark side go.
-1	negative	bipolar-disorder	One time I shot out a mall a convenience store and a church
-4	negative	bipolar-disorder	One time like 50 years ago when I was in elementary school I blew up the school and they never found out it was me
-4	negative	bipolar-disorder	On May 10 I got the call that changed my life my big brother was killed in a car accident. I still find it hard to accept even though I know it's true.  I can't sleep as I think of him. This is rough
-14	negative	bipolar-disorder	Or maybe it's someone.   He sits across the table from me and looks deep into my eyes.  I look back at him and smile, unsure of what to say next.  No words needed.  Food untouched.  Thirsts unquenched.  In a crowded room yet we are in our own world.  We finally realize where we are and pay the check, eager to be alone.  We leave and he takes my hand in his and pulls me close to him.  His voice, close to my ear, whispers that he loves me.  It is enough, more than enough.  
-21	negative	bipolar-disorder	Our mother passed on May 2, 2013. I was staying with my sister this past weekend and she said "where are all the pennies coming from?" they were being found all over the house. I told her, "haven't you ever heard of pennies from heaven?" She said "No" so I told her. She keeps finding pennies everywhere in the house. This morning I walk out to my Jeep to meet her at the Registrar of Wills, there is a shiny penny on the bumper of my Jeep! Then when I get home this afternoon, I tell my husband about all the pennies. He tells meuh; when I opened my beer case on Friday I heard something in the bottom of my box, I turned it upside down and two pennies fell in my hand. She is letting us all know she is OK. I love you Momma and miss you more than you will ever know. 
-4	negative	bipolar-disorder	People in your classes think you're the depressed, shy, sweet girl. But really you're just covering up you have ASPD, and graphically imagine spraying their blood all over the classroom.
-3	negative	bipolar-disorder	People please, no one is gonna tell you're perfect. But trust me you are perfect in your eyes, and in your lovers eyes and the people who loves you.
-5	negative	bipolar-disorder	Pet Rescue- I don't quite know how to explain this. But every time I look at someone it's like I play pet rescue. If you have played the game you might understand, but when I look at a person all the different sections of colors become separate and the person is being sliced into blocks. I try to make all of the blocks disappear by matching two or more of the same colored blocks. So basically I try to make the entire person disappear using this method. I don't know why, or when it started, but it's kind of weird isn't it?
-6	negative	bipolar-disorder	Please help- I want to change my life around begin new habits, lose weight, eat healthy, and be in a relationship with someone without me saying it up because I'm scared Any advice or questions for more details just ask I'm new at this so probley not explaining myself very well I just need help!! Advice! Anything! Please
-1	negative	bipolar-disorder	Pretty much turned vegan and lovin it!
-5	negative	bipolar-disorder	Psh! Says who? Lol jk I'm far from perfect nor is my goal to be! I'm flawed and I've accepted this. I love myself and anyone who doesn't..well okay sorry you won't be apart of the awesome life of Sam!
-5	negative	bipolar-disorder	Rarely is it ever the case that that any of us willingly abandon a friend. Usually it is a case of either time or distance splitting you apart after a while or perhaps it is changes. At any rate when forced recently to cut a YoungBlood adrift, I realized that it had been the one of the three that seemed to matter the least. The other two were trainwrecks by my own admission. Yes I do admit on both of our parts - Etain and Morrigan that we might have been generous with the current losses but mercy is a virtue we aspire to rather than sneer at. Do we mourn those lost? Absolutely but it is understood that at times we must lose some or endanger our own wellbeing in the process.
-1	negative	bipolar-disorder	Really Dark and it scares me sometimes
-2	negative	bipolar-disorder	Really morbid horror stories and poetry come naturally to me. I have no idea why. I also see these really bloody, terrible images in my head that I can't control, and I can't blame it on movies because I rarely watch them.
-2	negative	bipolar-disorder	Revenge. I love the uncontrollably happy feeling you get when your doing something bad to someone you don't like. To get revenge when someone does something bad to you. The best part is scheming all the things you can do.
-6	negative	bipolar-disorder	R.I.P. Baby Liam &lt;3   Your anniversary of your death is coming soon, and I can't help but be sad. I know you're up in heaven with God. Yet I miss you so much  you're in our minds and out hearts. I hope you're watching over our family. I love you, little buddy.
-2	negative	bipolar-disorder	Saying that I have a dark side is like saying dictionaries only define one word. Help me.
-7	negative	bipolar-disorder	Seriously. I can't remember the last time I genuinely smiled. Everything has went wrong. No relationship, no family support, no friends, no job/money.. I'm not sure what to do at this point. It's feels like I'm just in a bad dream waiting to wake up. I try to pray, but my faith isn't as strong as it should be. I hope things turn around quickly for me, I'm truly depressed.
-2	negative	bipolar-disorder	She lies awake, wishing it would end,  But consuming her hidden hopes.
-1	negative	bipolar-disorder	She sat alone,    She is dead.
-8	negative	bipolar-disorder	She was my best friend for 5 years  She has an eating disorder and I tried my best to be here through everything.. When she passed out.. Went to the hospital.. Cut herself.. Everything. She was my other half.. My shoulder to cry on.. Then her boyfriend came along and she cared about him more and claimed I didn't care about her going to the hospital.. I hurt every night.. I can't listen to any of the music we used to listen to.. I miss you so much
-2	negative	bipolar-disorder	Since I got alopecia, I spend alot of time on my own or at work. I feel like i dont fit in with my friends and family anymore. Dont get me wrong i have lovely friends and family. They start to feel sorry for me when i start to talk about what really bugs me and how i feel about my alopecia. Also i feel talking about how i feel is depressing cause i always end up talking about the disease i have! I dont mean too it just comes out. Thats why i choose to work more as this way i dont have time to think about myself. Im a nurse, i love looking after other people, i lose myself in looking after other people.
-4	negative	bipolar-disorder	Sleepless nights.  My dark side releases every time I step into my house, I'm not the same person. At school I am my light half, but once I get home my darker side seems to take over.
-3	negative	bipolar-disorder	So i like animals really i adore cats so much but when someone is good to me and say that he love me i love to hurt them to punch them.. But im no good.  
-12	negative	bipolar-disorder	so Ive seen a therapist and he believes i have Adhd and I'm borderline Borderline personality disorder. and I don't know, that doesn't feel like to me. I personally think i'm a psychopath but whatever. I stopped seeing him due to financial troubles but now im starting to think that's a bad idea. I know my confidence has taken a few hits recently but I've been feeling depressed and unbalanced. i took an online quiz on mania and i scored really high. I feel as erratic as when I'm on my cycle and i can barely focus enough to spell check my post. its hard to gather my thoughts and im irritated by everyones around me. Does anyone with the above disorders or any other disorders have any tricks or tips to help them through? Should i try to scrap more money together to see my therapist?
-4	negative	bipolar-disorder	So, just join the club and find out a lot of people thinking they are "sociopath". You dont know what a sociopath is like, people! We are as close as being a politician as being a killer. So dont pretend like you have this sickness and underestimate it, just dont!
-6	negative	bipolar-disorder	Somedays I feel like this relationship with my boyfriend is failing. I try to carry on a conversation with him and it feels like I'm talking to a brick wall and get no response. Other times I get one word answers, which I find annoying.  But everyday I still love him. 
-2	negative	bipolar-disorder	Some of my favorite topics are love, religion, and myself. Which do you want too discuss?
-1	negative	bipolar-disorder	Sometimes I feel like I am not sick enough. Sure, I am depressed and I'm being treated with medicine, but I still feel like no one takes this seriously. I'm sorry.
-1	negative	bipolar-disorder	Sometimes I get really aggressive an just need punch someone.. Most of the time I don't do that, but just scratch myself or whatever to calm down again. It scares me a bit :/
-3	negative	bipolar-disorder	sometimes I hate thinking about the ones I lost, I try not to think about them. because it makes me mad I can't visit heaven. I know there doing better. but I miss them so much..  I MISS YOU AND I LOVE YOU ALL.
-3	negative	bipolar-disorder	Sometimes, I like to smell old books just for the old, antique, comforting though. And I'll put them back on the shelf in the librarybut in the wrong place.  That's my darkside.
-11	negative	bipolar-disorder	Sometimes I pretend to be my favorite characters from certain books haha. I absolutely love reading and sometimes i just love the characters so much that I act them out. I'll be in my kitchen saying their lines and if someone walks in and asks what I'm doing I say  talking to myself XD ( everybody I know believes I talk to myself)
-3	negative	bipolar-disorder	Sometimes I think that I'm better off alone. I'm infatuated of the thought of being with someone, being loved. The feeling of being alone makes me cringe, yet I'm always alone.
-1	negative	bipolar-disorder	Sometimes you have to go through alot to get your goal. x

-8	negative	bipolar-disorder	So.. Monday at my school we have Challenge day.  It taught me to never forget the past, but learn from it. So this year I'm going to live in the present. I'm going to talk to more, and if people make fun of me. Oh well that THERE promblem. My dad nots in my life && that's okay. He is worthless! He will see what mistake is making when I get married & have kids.
-2	negative	bipolar-disorder	so prove you are the other woman. I need the other woman.  I dont know what else to say
-13	negative	bipolar-disorder	So, when I was in my mid twenties, I worked in this office with my supervisor and three others.  the three of them along my supervisors daughter were all engaged. So one day, one of the others says just think by this time next week your daughters going to be married and in a month I'm going to be. The second said," me in two months. The third said and two months after that I'm going to be married.  I said, As soon as I hear the word marry, I'm going to be dead. All most sounds like a joke.  Not one of my better ones deal with it.

-5	negative	bipolar-disorder	that no one will ever see. she comes out when I'm alone. and sometimes I wonder if anyone will ever truly know me.
-5	negative	bipolar-disorder	The hole isn't healing. I wish I could say that I'm okay, but I'm not anymore. Anyways I love you, Asher. 
-1	negative	bipolar-disorder	The more I read about sociopaths and psychopaths I can't help but smile or laugh. It's just so fitting! Have a good day. Or such.
-5	negative	bipolar-disorder	The only reason I want to be rich is so that I can have a home of my own and so that could be able to live and not worry about bills. It would also be nice to help my parents and brother. Someday I hope to call myself rich and live a life right now I can only dream of
-5	negative	bipolar-disorder	There are a lot of people on here claiming to be sociopaths who have other problems ie depressed and looking for meaning. This wasn't me bragging for those who feel like I was. I'm putting these fake people in their place. I am intrigued with all your replies  
-4	negative	bipolar-disorder	There are children and babies everywhere. I hate when they cry or smell. I'm a dog person and my dog smells better and hardly ever barks. I go to church and the moms don't shut there children up plus there is too many children in one spot.  I say "Just kill me now!".  Babies and children are brats.
-2	negative	bipolar-disorder	There are times when I can't control my temper and I say rude things to people that I love because only them has the power to hurt my feelings.  I feel guilty after that. Even if they are wrong and they blame me, I go berserk but in the end I approach them and tell how sorry I am for being rude.
-2	negative	bipolar-disorder	Theres more going on here, than you will ever know, the revolutions coming after you  On your ascension to a throne
-16	negative	bipolar-disorder	There was a girl at the start of uni, I had a massive thing for her. Around Christmas 2012, I finally cropped up the courage to ask her if she wanted to go out on a date and she said yes and asked me what had taken so long. I pointed out that until a month and a half before, she's been dating my best friend at uni, so I had to wait and then ask if he was cool with it, due to the bro code. About 2 weeks later, I find out that the girl who I'd been seeing had been seeing my friend FIRST!!! That was when I decided that, regardless of how much I'd liked her, she just wasn't worth it.
-5	negative	bipolar-disorder	The way I am with this side would probably surprise people whom I know in real life. Not even my closest friends know about all of it. I'm the only person who knows completely about this side of me. 
-1	negative	bipolar-disorder	The weak hide themselves in the dark .A message for the ones who think that playing with the Devil is fun. Being stuck on the dark side , such a lowly way to live .
-4	negative	bipolar-disorder	They are trashy people & I can't get along with them to save my life. Guess why they don't like me because I'm nothing like them. It's sad that in order to be liked I have to lower myself to their level but I refuse. I'm tired of my boyfriend getting treated like crap while his two brothers get treated like gold all because they have reproduced. It's sickening that they are like that all they care about is having kids they can pollute with their ignorance.
-6	negative	bipolar-disorder	This Experience is more sinister than I originally thought. I added it to my list because I believe that there are two sides to me; the one who everyone sees and think they know, and the other side; the one who reveals herself through my writing. Words are my only escape, my vice since high school. I don't binge drink or do drugs or cut myself. I don't have suicidal thoughts. But I am lonely, I am a little depressed and I'm thankful that I have a way out which doesn't involve hurting myself or the people I love. My other side, the Black Cat, she is my savior. She is dark and unhappy, and as much as I wish that she didn't exist, I admit that I need her. She's creative and brilliant; without her I wouldn't be able to write. Without her I would be lost.
-1	negative	bipolar-disorder	This is a survey of sorts. How would you rate yourself in terms of materialism. 1 being you dont care if I smash your $1000 phone and 10 just the opposite.
-4	negative	bipolar-disorder	This might sound creepy but I have another personality that came around a few months ago. Her name's Raina and she's not really dangerous or anything just another side of me I guess.
-3	negative	bipolar-disorder	This past Saturday I lost a guy whom I knew. We were incredibly close, but we had had a few good conversations and he was sweet.  I don't know how to handle death. Is it wrong I didn't cry much?
-7	negative	bipolar-disorder	Those few words. They hit hard, like when you would get hit with a ball to the head playing dodge ball in primary school, and the worst part, they come at the time you least expect and from the ones you didn't ever think would say it. People say that they are just words, but words are more powerful then a lot of people think. I have a scar on my body for every single hurtful word anyone has ever said to me. People don't understand it; what they say can hurt. The one person you didn't think would ever turn against you seems to be the only one who does. It's as if everyone who you thought would stick by you no matter what, are always the ones who are the first to walk out. Tonight I've decided I'm done with those people. As I sit here covered in my own blood, a fresh cut for everyone who's ever hurt me. Well, thats all they will ever be to me from now on. A scar.
-18	negative	bipolar-disorder	Today is my first post.  Been with my husband 26 years.  I'm still in love with the man I married however that man is hard to find in the man I'm with today. I'm here so someone will hear my voice.  There are people in my live that I could go to, but I am embarassed & I don't know who I can trust to keep my feeling to themselves.  And others who just don't have the time.  I do find a lot of strength in my faith. Now I am not the woman he fell in love with either. We all change, we all get old, we all get lazy. We have two children 21 year old girl living at home, has two jobs & going to college. A 16 year old son in high school.  I keep telling myself to hold out until they are out of the house & have established their own lives.  That will be several years.  But how do I live with this repulsiveness?  How to I "act" like it all ok? I am so lost and so lonely. That's enough for today. 
-1	negative	bipolar-disorder	Today is one of the hard days. Everyday has been up and down since my boyfriend Joe died 2 months ago in a car crash. I just woke up with no real motivation. Just laid in bed with his pillow re reading text conversations. He was so special i truely feel he was my one and only soulmate. I need him back I hate this life with out him.
-1	negative	bipolar-disorder	Today I woke again into this life 
-22	negative	bipolar-disorder	Today, right now, I miss talking to you! Yes, this is about me today. I had a crappy night, I made some stupid choices, and now I hurt And I want a friend to talk with, but you arent there. Yes, I totally get it, Im making it about me! I know you need time, I know you need space, I know you need to figure this out on your own, I know that the only way that will happen effectively is if I leave you alone. But today, I dont want to leave you alone. I want a friend to lean on! I want to talk to you, I want you to tell me a stupid story about something that doesnt mean anything. I want you to make me laugh! I want you to tell me what youve been doing! ANYTHING! I want you to say SOMETHING! I want to know that everything is ok! Yes, I get it  all that Ive said is I I I Me
-3	negative	bipolar-disorder	trying to figure me out is like doing the impossible it's really not worth the time and effert you'd have to put in, I am the most complicated person you'll ever meet! 
-3	negative	bipolar-disorder	Trying to let go of the hurt my future SIL has caused me. Things are civil now, but just looking at her still makes me sick to my stomach. How can I let go of the hurt and tolerate being around her at family gatherings? It's so hard at Christmas time.  With all this said, I think the probability of another big blowup happening soon is relatively small. Nothing huge (only passive aggressive) has happened since her wedding. I really want to let go and be happy for her and welcome this baby into the world, but I still feel so terribly hurt by everything that has happened. I can't stand knowing that she doesn't like me for no reason. I've never been in a situation like this before.
-5	negative	bipolar-disorder	Under all this kindness and love lies a dark and disturbed person that feeds off all negativity and wants death to all at times while my father and his girlfriend sleep I go into the room with a knife and just stand at the end of the bed just wanting to cut open their necks and watch them die slowly but I don't I wonder what am I waiting for
-2	negative	bipolar-disorder	Unfortunately we had to put our beloved Cooper down yesterday 25/Nov/13. He was a bundle of fun and mischief. Always wanting to play with his ball or toys and digging up the plants we had freshly planted.
-2	negative	bipolar-disorder	Visualizing horrible things when someone messed with u but just smiling and figuring out a way to get back at them without anyone knowing
-5	negative	bipolar-disorder	well since i was 8 or 9 ive had phases of three or four weeks of being depressed, self conscious, wanting to end my life, and not wanting to talk to anyone. then i get 2 to 4 weeks of being over confident, happy and hyper. i always try to hide it, but its getting harder and harder and i dont know if im bipolar. please leave comments and say what you think
-12	negative	bipolar-disorder	We met when we were four. He was my first "boyfriend", I was shy he was not. I couldn't easily make friends so he let his friends be my friends. We were best friends. I spent so many weekends at his house with his older brother, him, his younger brother and his mum and dad. I always felt awkward places, but there with his family I felt comfortable. Soon after his father was convicted of murder, they say he did it deliberately. That he killed his three sons. But I can't accept this, the man I had spent so many days under the care of, a man I liked killed someone I loved. I won't accept it.
-3	negative	bipolar-disorder	"What happens in the dark, will come to light" Is anyone else worried, waiting, for things they've done to come out?
-2	negative	bipolar-disorder	What's your side?  I want to hear stories. Snow day and I am bored.
-1	negative	bipolar-disorder	when i get angry i think of the most horrible way to kill the person who made me upset kill them or hurt them badly and it gets so graphic !:0
-1	negative	bipolar-disorder	When I get angry or upset I can always lift twice as much weight as normal, I get these dark thoughts of dif. Things ( don't want to go into detail) I am a psychic and I can feel spirits clearer, I always wanted to know what it's like to kill someone and feel the knife sink into someone's body, I can't control my thoughts or anger an have punched a couple holes in my wall
-11	negative	bipolar-disorder	When I get super mad or frustertead or sad or upset my dark side comes out to play . It takes me over like a trans and I am a complete  different person when this happens . Also  when I get really protective  of something and some on threatens that person my dark side comes out and this is when it is strongest . My dark side is very powerful and stronge when released . So ya thAts my dark side
-2	negative	bipolar-disorder	When is the time to tell someone you're dating that you are bi-polar?
-3	negative	bipolar-disorder	when it comes down to a deal, a sale, a trade with the enemy i will have no mercy i would back stab them no matter what the cost was but when im with family or my wife i cant hurt a fly so what does that make me??
-2	negative	bipolar-disorder	When i was 4 years old i had a dog named chelsey she was a cute big dog! But i only knew her for a little of time ;'( She dug a hole under the fence and ran away! ;'(
-5	negative	bipolar-disorder	When I was in school everyone wasn't respectful and they kept on saying I'm stupid because every time I talk to them I would like fake a childish accent so that they would enjoy every word I say, that time my accent is really childish but my attitude was not as childish as them, I just tried to talk like that so that they won't think I'm very rude to them but it turned out to be wrong then my friend told me, "Don't try to change yourself just for people to notice you, just be yourself and have fun." In that time I was very surprised that someone said that because I was not expecting that to happen. So after everything that my friend told me I was at least a little confident to show who I really am and starting to have many friends.
-9	negative	bipolar-disorder	When I was in year three i was picked I got s mad I grabbed my drink bottle and pegged it at the kids face he was scared in the right eye and can barely see.a few weeks later I was pushed to the ground and kids started kicking me I was so angry they would such a thing I uppercuted them in the face. I have been hiding this side for long time but when someone does something so bad that it makes someone cry I just can't hold it in): Help me
-10	negative	bipolar-disorder	When I was younger, during my elementary and middle school years, I was the good kid. People always commented on my assiduous altruism. They called me humble and well-behaved. My mom and family exalted me for a time.  I reasoned that if I wanted all this attention, I had to continue to be good. I did not do things out of the innocence of the act, but because I loved the praise. I was selfish. It sustained my immature insecurities. This is my new path. This is my new dawn. After all, I am the Son of the Morning Star.
-5	negative	bipolar-disorder	When I was younger I took pleasure in harming people mentally. The pleasure I gained from watching my peers crack under pressure was immense. The weaker their mind, the harder they cracked. Actually being violent or murdering someone does not intrigue me, but to bring someone to the breaking point where they consider suicide, that gave me satisfaction.  As a supervisor, I see my past guilty pleasures surfacing here and there. Yet, I believe in occupational integrity so I refuse to indulge in the mental anguish of others; for now.
-3	negative	bipolar-disorder	When I write poetry it's sometimes dark and deep. Some of my friends think its weird and that I shouldn't write like that.
-5	negative	bipolar-disorder	When someone looks at me, they see a fragile girl in an oversized shirt that fawns over her friends. Tiny. Shy. Small. They see someone that will never stick up for herself when she should. That's what makes that side of me dark.
-3	negative	bipolar-disorder	When there's love it's dark  Your potential darker black
-7	negative	bipolar-disorder	When the world goes black and there is no hope. No hope of ever being normal, of ever being happy, of ever being loved. I envelope myself in this darkness and hold it close to my heart because I know it is all that is ever true and any ray of sunshine that has ever managed to penetrate was fleeting and short lived. I am a demon, I must be and in the end there is no hope for me.
-3	negative	bipolar-disorder	When was the last time you loved someone that time didn't matter? I wish you knew.
-1	negative	bipolar-disorder	When you anger me, the world catches fire.  You made your choice, and youve angered me.
-8	negative	bipolar-disorder	While I am alone most of the time. I don't regret being single. Although, it stings sometimes, but then I think I would be lonelier if I hung on to those whom ignored me. After waiting for nearly a decade for someone to make up their mind, clearly this is better. Loneliness is both a gift and a curse, you watch all the happy couples having someone to share themselves with. You also learn more about yourself then most people ever do. 
-8	negative	bipolar-disorder	Why do people get so upset over another persons misfortune?  Also, I never understood why people get all upset when someone who self sabotaged themselves get what they deserve. Like someone crying and saying "OMG Grandpa has been diagnosed with Cancer, what a tragedy!" It's like NO SH*T SHERLOCK, the man smoked two packs of cigars a day for decades, what y'all expect? Empaths will forever baffle me
-9	negative	bipolar-disorder	why do people think they are perfect none of us are! We make mistakes but the main think is to learn from it and not repeat them. I have lived so many lives and i can not judge anyone or look down upon someone maybe I needed to be humbled and that why I went through the stuff i did who knows.okay that was my ranting for thursday!! Dont worry there will be more!!! Random thought #1 I wish i was a Walton  after every thought i will be adding a random thought thats my first one feel free to add coments and random thoughts!!!
-3	negative	bipolar-disorder	Would anyone like to see my booty ? It's really big for a guy! It will make your day please respond it can be guy or a girl I don't care just want to show of my booty
-3	negative	bipolar-disorder	Wowwwwww dysfunctional doesn't really cover it!  None of us are coherent around here if we communicated exactly what we need and when we need it, I think it would be a better household  That's what I call dysfunction.  lol  
-6	negative	bipolar-disorder	YAY!!!! Thanks for the address :-)  You will probably never know how excited I was when P said you gave it to him!!!  I yelled YYYYAAAAAAYYYY!!!!! So, you'll be getting a pkg soon. I hope when you open it you can feel and recognize all the love we have for you :-) Man, I miss you my friend! 
-1	negative	bipolar-disorder	Yeah, nobody is perfect. Being perfect is a flaw I guess.
-4	negative	bipolar-disorder	Yea i made mistakes nobody in this world is perfect but that doesnt mean that the mistakes i did in the past is gunna stop me from trying to make something good out of myself 
-3	negative	bipolar-disorder	Yea I never told but dad did it I can't even discus it on here fu@# im so close to ending myself
-1	negative	bipolar-disorder	Yep Also a child of a dad that does drugs. :/
-4	negative	bipolar-disorder	Yep, far from it. That's why I try not to judge, as I am not perfect why should I expect anyone else to be?
-1	negative	bipolar-disorder	Yep, its more dark than you think lol
-4	negative	bipolar-disorder	Yess I do but who doesn't and if you want you can get to no both sides of me (;
-1	negative	bipolar-disorder	You and a friend are running away from a murderer. .B. Keep running.
-5	negative	bipolar-disorder	You are a joke. We are a joke. What a joke. Oh excuse me how terribly uncreative of me. Replicating to what is known as humor. You just keep thinking you have the last laugh but remember who destruction is because massacre eventually follows.
-1	negative	bipolar-disorder	You ever sit in a group if people, look around and realize that your exsistance at that moment means nothing to any of them? Yeah that's my life everyday ..
-8	negative	bipolar-disorder	You have been gone 2 years.  I miss you so much.  I didn't think my heart could break but it shattered when you died.  You will always and forever be in my thoughts.  I hope you hear me when I talk to you ( out loud and I know you would be saying I am crazy). I love you and miss you xxxx
-1	negative	bipolar-disorder	You have hate, you have anger But you don't use them. Strike me down with your Jedi weapon and complete your journey to the dark side of the force.
-2	negative	bipolar-disorder	You know, my dark side is up so often, i feel most people know me by it
-3	negative	bipolar-disorder	You told me to be social and make friends You know I don't know how and I'm so scared.. How do I talk to people.. You wanted me to talk to boys.. You're my therapist.. You're supposed to help me! To teach me how! :'(
-1	negative	bipolar-disorder	You wouldn't believe it because I seem so sweet and innocent. But I am not as chaste as people like to think. I'm more conservative now than I use to be but my tendencies are still there.
-1	negative	emotional-health	Aaarrggghhhh!!!! When will this end!! 
-3	negative	emotional-health	A blurry, fuzzy, whimpering thing ever tugging at my mind..There is this basic need just to be hugged. To feel another warm body crush against mine and to simply be held tightly. I don't want to talk. I'm bad at that kind of thing. I want to feel safe and secure. I wish people weren't so complex and you could build a friendship just from hugging and close proximity. Where this ache comes from and why it exists, idfk
-7	negative	emotional-health	About a month ago this would've killed me. It did kill me when I had to let go of my boyfriend and so many close friends 5 months ago. But now I'm finally learning how to let go of people and not experience the pain and depression that came with it before. If people exit my life, it's probably for the better and I finally understand that. This week has been a week of awakening for me and I've learned so much and come so far the past 5 months. I'm so proud of myself, whereas before all I could do was hate myself.
-15	negative	emotional-health	After divorcing, and living alone for almost 4 months now, it hurts me that he still harasses me. I gave it all to him, and wanted nothing for myself, yet still he's steady bothering me!!! Always asking me who I'm with, and even asks me where I'm going???? I have to constantly remind him that we are no longer together. Still he continues to harass me.  What hurts the most is that we can't get along for the kids. He always starts off so nice, but before the night is thru he has to end it hurting my feelings calling me names or being just rude. It really hurts my feelings cause I'm not the one calling him or texting him. Why bother me to hurt me?????? 
-3	negative	emotional-health	All my life I've had to be in a huge competition with my sisters. No matter what I do, I always tend to lose. My parents make it perfectly clear that I'm unwanted and they would be so much better without me and it kills me on a daily basis because I'm constantly reminded of it and I just don't even know what to do anymore.. I've cut and I've wanted to die and I just wish I was never born. I feel like my parents and families lives would be a lot easier if I wasn't in the picture.
-1	negative	emotional-health	All the time, but what other option is there when you live in America.  My workplace certainly doesn't tolerate anything other than upbeat.   It would literally be impossible to say anything else than fine let alone act any other way than fine.
-1	negative	emotional-health	Although I don't consider myself a walking time-bomb or a perfect picture of health, but there are some things I feel get worse with stress. The thing about it is, I know I get annoyed and agitated at certain things--I don't think I am stressed out. All my friends tell me I am, and I have a lot of reasons to be, butI guess I just don't feel it.  I mean, what else is there to do? Do you think I am in denial?
-3	negative	emotional-health	Always wishing, constantly hoping, looking forward through the darkness, longing to see the glimpse of light that will carry me through.  However dark the tunnel becomes, I try to become ever stronger.
-2	negative	emotional-health	Am having a moment where my head is not buzzing with a million thoughts at once. There's only one voice. Almost forgot what that was like 
-6	negative	emotional-health	Am I a good person? Deep down, do I even really want to be a good person, or do I only want to seem like a good person so that people (including myself) will approve of me? Is there a difference? How do I ever actually know whether I'm bullshitting myself, morally speaking? 
-2	negative	emotional-health	Am sorry with my Emotions  You know who You are .
-7	negative	emotional-health	Am so tired pf living . I haven't done anything to be proud of except make kids I did raise the one that I do have doesn't respect me and he ten . Am sick of life and all I see in it . when I look back I things about what I've done which really doesn't amount to much. I have finish school ,all I do is sit in my house day to day.  I've come up with a plan to set my life right .
-2	negative	emotional-health	And also a guy who makes me laugh and have a good time 
-2	negative	emotional-health	And am always glad for more.No more phases I think would mean the start of closed minded ness.
-4	negative	emotional-health	and last night my husband told me im ugly, a "skeleton" and a turnoff. when i got upset he said he meant it as motivation for me to eat more  i am so cut up about this.
-4	negative	emotional-health	And that's where I am lately. Work has me stressed out more than ever. I've never been one to place work over health, so I hope this situation changes soon -I'm getting too old to be looking at a career change now.
-2	negative	emotional-health	And the courage to change the things I can and the wisdom to know the difference. Bless The Lord everybody, got my praise on todayfeeling blessed and highly favored!!!! #happysundayyall!! 
-3	negative	emotional-health	And the sun just puts me in a good mood altogether.  I think I'm solar charged! Haha.
-6	negative	emotional-health	Anger felt like a savior, waking me up from a long coma. I want to let go of its embrace. It seeped into my muscles and runs in my veins. I'm so tense all the time. I'm alive but in my own world. It gives strength but takes something. Its payment. My spark is dimming, candle flame flickering out. I need to let it go. I can warm myself up from inside. I want to share warmth and connect, not be tense and grow distant. I don't know the steps to balance, and I know things come around stronger when ignored. I just want to let compassion pour through. 
-1	negative	emotional-health	Anything good in my life. Actually being so sick and tired of my life is a good thing. I just wonder how further the rabbit hole can take me. 
-3	negative	emotional-health	A PCI test helps employers decide whether or not applicant's personalities are desire able.   Has anybody had the same experience?

-4	negative	emotional-health	as 2013 comes to an end, there's no better way to begin the new year by letting go of the extra baggage that's slowing me down: 
-4	negative	emotional-health	As a victim of bullying myself, I know beyond a doubt that bullying is absolutely awful. I've grown strong enough now that if I see anyone doing it, I will personally go help the victim out. NO TOLERANCE!
-1	negative	emotional-health	As long as you give a signal you want to know me.   Noone has ever called me difficult.   I just need that signal you want me around you.
-7	negative	emotional-health	As night closes in I often find myself coming to terms with the fact that I'm all alone. That there is no one here, no one to talk to, it's just me and next to me No one. I don't want to call my boyfriend again as much as I'd love to. But it feel as if I'm annoying him, becoming too clingy. I decide to not strain our relationship because I'm scared. The first good thing in my life and I'm just so afraid to lose it. So instead I lie there, curled up in a ball and let the tears trickle down my face. As I come to terms with the fact that I'm officially all alone. Solitude A time bomb for depression. Depression You cannot define.
-1	negative	emotional-health	At a young age I was forced to endure some very hard stuff..  I have a scars that cover my whole belly.  I do not try to hide them.  Not a huge fan of having my stomach touched.

-7	negative	emotional-health	BiPolar disorder. You know the feeling. It's like anything of whatever, a person says or does, can trigger your mood. It doesn't matter how little it is, or how unimportant it can be. Something emotionally and mentally triggers you to get mad, sad, depressed, or anything negative at that moment.  &lt;3
-3	negative	emotional-health	Boyfriend of three years Isn't intimate anymore. Why is this. I want to talk to him about it but every time I do he says stop and kisses me. I just want that beginning passion again.
-5	negative	emotional-health	 Well, I few days have past and I am thinking much differently than when I posted this story. Of course, I matter! And this story matters,for some people. So, I shall leave it posted, though irrelevant for me today.
-4	negative	emotional-health	- I have been fighting to find a reason to continue loving for such a very long time. I am tired of fighting. I'm ready to go now. It's not that I think life is a bad thing. It's not that I don't think there is anything worth living for. It's just that I've lived long enough. I am ready to stop. I am 44 years old and I can feel time slipping away. Already I have aches and pains and I don't relish the idea of slowly falling apart for the next thirty years. I'm ready to let go. I'm tired.
-6	negative	emotional-health	 Sometimes we think of others, but know not how to express those feelings, or if we ever cross whomever's mind. It's nice to go down memory lane and sometimes painful to revisit those memories as well. If only we could send our thoughts and feelings telepathically to reach an individual to let them know what we are thinking regardless if the person is in our past or whom we want in our present or future.
-15	negative	emotional-health	But I'm learning to deal with it! As a child, I was seldom told no by my loving family. Then I entered the world of strangers and failed to realize I would not be treated the same. I used to think I was better then other people and would become silently enraged when they got higher opportunities then me. Now, I understand everyone has their strengths and weaknesses, and the people that get far have patience, humility, and the ability to work hard, connect to other people, believe in themselves aside from making comparisons. I still to this day get mad when I see someone doing better at want I want to do, but I catch myself two seconds after, tell myself it's wrong, take a deep breathe, promise to treat them and myself kindly, and choose to coexist instead of compete. My time has come and will continue coming as I shed my ego. 
-3	negative	emotional-health	 but should I come out? But it's still worrying me, I guess. At least I can be honest here.
-1	negative	emotional-health	"Call me crazy"  not literally though. So don't
-1	negative	emotional-health	Check out my profile and let me know
-13	negative	emotional-health	Christmas as a kid was magical. It wasn't about the presents. It was about being with my family and going to church on Christmas Eve in my small church. It was knowing everyone in that church and spending ages after Mass talking to everyone. It was about community, family. I think what is getting me down is that around this time of year people seem to be so busy with social commitments, going to so many Christmas parties and functions and I don't have any. And two of the girls at work are complaining how they have to go to their partners' family for lunch and then their family for dinnerI'm sorry I would love to have a partner to spend Christmas with, I'd love to 'have to' go to my partners family for Christmas
-1	negative	emotional-health	Christmas is right around the corner so my mother and I went shopping. 
-4	negative	emotional-health	Closeness, love, and utter happiness is what I crave, and all this comes when I'm intimate with him. God I wish you where here.
-3	negative	emotional-health	Confession of the day, when people ask if I've been crying, I tell them I'm just high or have allergies 
-1	negative	emotional-health	Crushed My only opportunities are for release.
-1	negative	emotional-health	Dear Broken Heart,                                 
-10	negative	emotional-health	(Don't get me wrong I love my husband) I want a guy who is gonna treat me like a princess who would put me n my kids first a cowboy who uses his manners and is romantic sweet lovin, Carin, someone who is a redneck truck kinda guy!! Someone who'll take me out n public and wanna go dancin!!
-2	negative	emotional-health	Don't really see to many who want to talk to me, I'm alone for ever
-2	negative	emotional-health	Do you ever just cry? Cry for everyone and everything because you know they can't be saved. Cry because this world is cruel and unfair. Just cry and cry and cry until the blood vessels below your eyes have appeared and your eyelids have become puffy and swollen.
-1	negative	emotional-health	Do you ever just lay in bed and think or just stare into the darkness? I stare into the darkness for hours on end and can still not clear my thoughts. My thoughts consume my me. I try not to let it get to me, but it does. I can't shake the feeling of remorse for things I wasn't even apart of. The darkness is pulling me in and I just might like it.
-3	negative	emotional-health	Dreams - Fleetwood Mac You'll know, you will know, you'll know
-3	negative	emotional-health	Due to being exposed to a different perspective, I now know what things I consider pride-worthy for myself.  Everything that I'm proud of is a result of something I worked very hard for in some way, shape, or form. And I feel very excited about it. And all the things I'm proud of carry lessons learned.
-10	negative	emotional-health	Ehmagawd so like, my mom took me to go get golden highlights, and it looks SO  gorgeous in my shiny dark brown hair. i LOVE it!!!!! yay me!!!! i also went to the mall with my bestie Sadie. we went to Juicy and bought like alot of stuff. after that, we went to my guest house tried on everything. i looked so  ahamzing. i LUHVVVV my life!!!! -Meagen Kaseyyy-
-1	negative	emotional-health	Especially in my family, they think I'm stuck up but I'm just quiet and a bit of an introvert
-1	negative	emotional-health	Especially in the cold winter days. That feeling of the sun on your skin is so soothing! And you know, what's better? Having a whole mug of hot coffee while lying down on the terrace and reading your favorite book. Heaven! 
-1	negative	emotional-health	Even if they talk to me first, i still feel like i'm a burden. My friends probably hate me and think i'm really annoying. I have no one, i'm all alone. is weird that i like it this way? 
-9	negative	emotional-health	Even though I'm sad,Smiling is one way to fight back the pain that I'm feeling.It keeps me from feeling and worrying about my situation..Worrying makes it worse..I could easily stay depressed.2014 is A New Beginning..live more,laugh more,love more,pray more and inspire more..
-7	negative	emotional-health	Ever since high school my grades have gone down. Not badly, but B's in C's in my AP/Honors Classes. It's been tough. A year from now can seem like alot and my family keeps expecting more than I can give. My mind is slowly deteriorating and my Uncle tries to bully me. My Grandmother won't stop pestering me when I get home or late at night and my mother won't let me stay up late enough to finish my work so I've had to stay up once she fell asleep. I'm tired of it all and I don't know how I can get any further.
-3	negative	emotional-health	Ever since I had surgery in middle school I have been extremely self conscious. It was a much needed surgery to remove a cyst with cancerous cells under my right eye. I hate it really, and I constantly wonder if it will become more noticeable as I get older.
-4	negative	emotional-health	Everyday at school I put on my happy face to show that I'm happy on the outside but after that school day end I'm back to my normal moody self with just a plain expression on my face
-1	negative	emotional-health	Everyday feels like a dream but im not waking up
-1	negative	emotional-health	Every girl I reach out to becomes weird. Or something prevents me from being in a relationship, they like me one day, then they don't. It's boring now. And I'm just like, just care.
-9	negative	emotional-health	Everyone at school always says "oh my gosh you are so quiet" or "you never talk and you're so calm" but really inside they can't even imagine how much I'm screaming. How much I'm suffering in pain. How much I'm bleeding. And breaking. I can't wait to just become a better person when I'm older and show them all the real me. I want to take all my pain and just use it to make me stronger. I'm sick and tired of crying. I'm sick and tired of all the pain. So one day I am going to show them all and make them sorry for hurting me so much. For all those names they call me. Make them wish they had been my friend.
-6	negative	emotional-health	Everyone knows a different side of me, but nobody knows it all.  I'm tired of not being able to talk about my life to others, so I'm laying it all on the table on EP.  I just want someone to know who I am, for all of who I am.
-8	negative	emotional-health	Every relationship I've ever been in I've always found myself giving it a full 100% just for them to only give 25% in return.  All I want is for somebody to love me and understand me and accept me for me. Because that's exactly what i do for others. I give them my all. I love them with everything i've got, I understand them and I accept them for them. I take in all their flaws. I just wish I had somebody to be like that for me.
-4	negative	emotional-health	Everything in the universe has a design to it, like it was engineered.  Even snow flakes, leaves, cells - everything.  So, who or what did that engineering?  That is a question I think about every single day.  I don't believe in luck or chance.  Sometimes, I feel like my path is going to be different from most people.  I believe we were created, but I don't know his name.  I use to think I did, but further exploration on the etymology of all the common names has brought me back to the starting line.  One full circle to nothingness.  Sigh.
-9	negative	emotional-health	Everything just keeps going wrong at least every week! me or the family never get a break! It feels that we're the only family to experience all the bad things keeps happening! All I can do is really hope and believe that things will be better and will get better but deep down and something telling me it won't, I am trying to ignore that little voice!
-6	negative	emotional-health	Every time I try to think, I come up blank. My life before my 14th birthday is practically nonexistent. My life before my 15th birthday is getting blurrier and blurrier. I'm losing memories that I'm sure I used to have. Birthdays and christenings are turning hazy, and the clear memories I do have are all in third person.  I can't remember my own face. And as far as I can recall, I've thought this normal for most my life.
-3	negative	emotional-health	Feel like no one beleives in me. When I say i m going to do something everyone thinks I'm joking. 
-5	negative	emotional-health	Finally! It's starting to fade away. It's cost me everything, my home, business, everything, but I'm finally starting to see life again that is not encumbered by waiting for someone that is never coming back or that I can be with. I am at zero now and the only way to go is up. It's going to be a long fight but I finally feel that I can do it.
-9	negative	emotional-health	For awhile, I've known about being transgendered. But until recently, I never told anyone in my school about it. Well, the night before the 9th this month, I was, as usual, looking up topics and stories about transgendered people. Eventually, I broke down and cried myself asleep telling myself that I'm a girl. I was feeling so restrained recently, so I realized that I needed to tell someone close.      It felt amazing to come out to my closest friends. They all give me support when I need it Only thing left to do is to spread the truth to the others I can trust and eventually my family.
-1	negative	emotional-health	Forgiveness is letting go of all hopes for a better past
-4	negative	emotional-health	For once I'm not okay. After my ex dumping me a month ago I dread going to school. I've got people getting involved spreading rumours that they saw him and other girls holding hands and now those girls are texting me abuse. There is so much drama and tension and I can't do it. It's destroying me. I just want to be left in peace but I can't be. I can't deal with these girls texting me, I'm just ignoring it but I'm being made out to be such a horrible person. Im not. I don't know what I'm supposed to do.
-3	negative	emotional-health	For some reason my profile says 13-15? No. I'm 15. Almost 16. Haha, but I'd much rather prefer to speak to older people. Anywhere from 16-22? I'm definitely mature for my age and can relate to older people more then I can my own age group.
-6	negative	emotional-health	For some reason, people like me after getting to know me a little but after spending more than a few days together, people start to hate me and I don't know why!  I know some people are liked after others get to know them better but somehow I seem to suffer from the opposite syndrome!   It's so strange. It's like there's this bump in the friendship road with me and for those people that can get past that bump, they will remain my friend for years (case in point - my best friend has been here for me since we first met 13 years ago).   However, most people will think I'm okay and then once they get to know me betterboom.     
-2	negative	emotional-health	For the first time in a really long time, today I actually feel good about myself and I am content with who I am.
-8	negative	emotional-health	For the first time in my life I think I have gained something akin to self respect. Today I felt like shouting at the world, "I'am a man goddanm it! I need no money, a fancy car or women to prove what I'am!I'am what I'am and let the world do with me what it will."
-5	negative	emotional-health	For the most part I'm a hopeless optimistic! But there are days everyone seems to find my buttons, get under my skin and just say the wrong things. I hate feeling this way, maybe because I just lost my mom and I'm about to lose my grandmother, I thought I was handling everything alright, but suddenly I want to cuss a co-worker because she comes I bitching about everything, bit she always does that. Most of all I hate that I don't have patients for my children. I need a way to defuse!!!!
-10	negative	emotional-health	For years I have accepted suicide as an inevitability. Not tomorrow or next week, but sometime. When I have failed for the last time, and it is clear that I cannot be happy and successful I will finally kill myself. All I see are my failures, past and future. I will try to be successful at my goals, but will inevitably fail.  Some would say that to kill myself is cowardly and selfish but the real selfish act is not doing it sooner. I have people who love me, a wife who cares for me deeply and all I see is my failure that I will be for her someday. We may even have kids one day, and one day I will leave them all. If I was a courageous man I would kill myself now, to save those around me an even greater pain in the future. 
-5	negative	emotional-health	Genuine, caring and honest person here. Don't cheat or steal. Don't try to embarrass people or act high and mighty. I listen and I share. I give til it hurts. Its me that gets hurt in the end. They take all I have to offer and when I am empty they want more. When I can't give more they dump me.  Guess I am going to be alone. 
-2	negative	emotional-health	Get paid daily just to click ads. No registration fee required. Work from any country at any time. No age limit.  Referrer name is genuine123 
-1	negative	emotional-health	Getting married in 3 months and fiance is detached..! Doesn't initiate involvement in wedding planning.. And it has been awhile since we had emotional intimacy. Brought this up one time with him and got told off for thinking that way. I feel alone emotionally most of the time and it feels like i'm the only one excited for the wedding.  I can't help but to take it personally sometimes. I am hurt by his lack of attention. Any thoughts?
-8	negative	emotional-health	Got surgery on my right leg the first or second day after I was born. It stretches from my hip to about mid-thigh. When my mom offered to get it removed for me I gratefully declined. Why? Because I think scars are cool looking. And I tell people at the pool I got mine from a shark attack ^.^
-8	negative	emotional-health	GUAM Here I Come.! This Sunday I will be making the biggest and most important trip of my ENTIRE LIFE! :D am going to go live in Guam for 6 months, I have an Aunt that has a restaurant there and i will go to visit and work there.. I have never been outside the USA. Actually i have never been anywhere else but California, Arizona & Mexico.. And now am less than a week away from travelling all the way across the world  Gosh am so nervous and excited and sad! So many emotions at once.. This is amazing &lt;3
-2	negative	emotional-health	Haha.. I so wish I could just scream but I'm at work with so much to do here and so much at home Boy would it freak out my co workers ..it would almost be worth it.
-12	negative	emotional-health	Happiness Doesn't Really Exist in my life. There is ups and downs shure is, but the peak of something actualy working is nothing like the valleys och pure darkness. Every were I look I'm just seeing things that sadens me cant even look at other people or read the paper. But then.. does one really have to find happiness. cant life not be about something else than trying to chase the meaning of a empty word created just to sortout us from them That what keeps me awake every night the chase of something that may not exist 
-6	negative	emotional-health	Happysaddeterminedunmotivatedenergeticexhaustedworthy                worthlessconfidentdepressed. I go through all of these emotions and more sometimes in one day and it's exhausting. I would set myself to do something but my mood will change before I accomplish it making me just want to give up. I'm a wreck, feeling like I have a disorder that I can't control. It comes and go spontaneously and changes like crazy when people are involved. I can't handle my own moods, I feel like I'm on a roller-coaster almost everyday and I'm so sick of it. Is there something wrong with me? I hate the fact that it's so easily changed to the dark side where I can barely get through my day without breaking down. AHHHHHHHH, just want to drop everything and escape into a world where everything doesn't have to be so hard to deal with!!!
-4	negative	emotional-health	Hate is such a strong word.  I would rather say I'm unhappy with who I am now.  I will be honest, that a good deal of it is superficial. (First world problems) If you have images of me looking like my avatar, I don't. (As of today: Dec. 05, 1 Anyway, I don't even know where my happiness lies.  Perhaps, I need some counseling or stronger medication.  I just know that I'm frustrated and sad.
-4	negative	emotional-health	Have been seeing a psychiatrist about 8 yrs now, if someone is suffering from depression, mood swings, paranoia, ocd, adhd, cutting, anxiety, then I'd say it wouldn't be a bad thing to find a psychiatrist, someone to talk to, that'll figure out exactly what's wrong and fix it. if things are interfering with your everyday life or you feel like you could come close to suicide, the psychiatrist can help. some meds make you feel drugged up, better than being dead though. 
-2	negative	emotional-health	Have you ever experienced doing something you knew was bad but you cant stop doing it because it gives you comfort and reassurance? yeah, that's me and Mia (bulimia). 
-4	negative	emotional-health	Have you ever had that one song that just gets to you?i have
-3	negative	emotional-health	Having a scar means you've healed. You didn't perish.
-5	negative	emotional-health	He and me on a holiday trip to Saint Barth, to spend ten wonderful days there, at a cabin with the best scenario in the world surrounded by palm trees, white sand, calm sea Few  others around,  mostly couples on their honeymoon not eager to socialise so we are alone most of the time, food is served at our place twice a day, breakfast we take at the pool bar  fresh fruit juices. Days go by so fast but so unbelievably magicalnothing is real outside us, nothing matters, nothing exists eyes on eyes, hands in hands, bodies melting in one the magic of love   
-8	negative	emotional-health	Hearing about deaths and suicides affect me a lot.Some time back ,I heard about the  suicide of a guy younger than my daughter,He  studied in her college and they worked together.He has an ailing father and was the only son.No one has a clue why he did it  If you are anxious about something,it is better to talk it out with someone.
-10	negative	emotional-health	Heartacheday fiveI was fine yesterday.  I didn't miss him, barely thought about him.  My friend, I lost you through my selfish sexuality.  I should have kept our friendship platonicstupid me I thought no one would get hurtyour girlfriend didn't understand that they were just words to meI wouldn't have acted, EVER. Today, I feel that anchor on my heart.  Reminding me of what I lost. I refuse to let a tear drop.  My eyes well up, I blink and avoid the painful thoughts until I regain control. I hope tomorrow I see the glimpse of release from this torture that I had yesterday.
-10	negative	emotional-health	He does everything in the house! He cooks when am not home, he buys food and gets the rest, he loves our daughter to bits and takes care of her when am not home. He is otherwise the perfect husband. Trouble is he doesn't talk to me..he doesn't even look at me. It makes me sad that he  would rather hold a conversation with our 2 years toddler than say a word to mehe ignores me like am a ghost and don't exist in that space. Any attempt to have a conversation ends up nowhere and as a result, we do not do anything together. What am I doing wrong? 
-3	negative	emotional-health	He lives in Seattle and I just started having a relationship with him finally. Still, every time someone I know or care about gets diagnosed, I get upset.
-6	negative	emotional-health	Hello beautiful angel mummy's, I lost Ariana in January. 39 weeks pregnant,hadn't felt her move and went and got her checked and she was gone. Tight knot in the chord. I have since then been back at work, working hard and working out getting healthy again. Ladies, to anyone who has suffered a loss at any gestation, im so deeply sorry,and know that our time will come once again. NEVER GIVE UP HOPE. Our angels are with us always.xxxxx
-3	negative	emotional-health	He said he likes me but can't be with me. Wants to marry me later but can't b with me now Confusing?
-5	negative	emotional-health	He said he used to be angry. I asked how he got over it. He said he just let go of it. It wasn't worth it. It didn't serve him. This world has a lot of hate. I don't want to hate. Anger's inevitable, at least for moments. Anger doesn't dictate actions.I want to know how to release it without crossing the line.
-9	negative	emotional-health	He's my friend. but he's not anymore. He posted a comment telling someone to go kill themselves. I called him out for it. things got REALLY ugly. Now I just don't know what to do anymore. I'm mad and infuriated that he would ever post something like that it's not like him. but yet.. pathetically I miss him. I'm working against myself. Now that we're fighting, it feels like I've thrown away my better self but if that is who he really is do I want him to still be a part of me? I NEED HELP!
-3	negative	emotional-health	HEY!!!  If you need someone to talk to,vent to or just need some support and a friend I would live to be that person that can help you! I love helping people through there issues  message me if you would like to talk to me 
-9	negative	emotional-health	Hey guys it's Tasha again! Here to do another update.  My boyfriends brothers fianc gave me a shedload of clothes yesterday 10 - 12 - 14 and most of them fit me apart from size 10 trousers and some size 12"s but I'm working to my goal and it motivates me  my calves are starting to look good. Need to carry on and I'll see if any more of the clothes fit me in 6 months time!
-4	negative	emotional-health	Hey guys, I want to find something out. I normally weigh in 1st thing on a morning on an empty stomach. If I happen to weigh later that day just out of curiousity, the weight is like 3-4 lbs more. Is that my real weight or is it just water weight. It's really discouraging to see the number increase. I'm still pushing though.
-2	negative	emotional-health	Hi am married, but am lonely my partner is like a stranger to me we have two kids, but we hardly sit together n talk or sleep together he is like a room mate. I need some one to talk to is that too much to ask for
-11	negative	emotional-health	Hi everyone i just found out i have polyfragmented DID. I truly believe i have one if the worst cases. I most definetly have thousands of parts. And a hanful of personality clusters most i do not really think i know. It is very confusing living like this. I have a part of me for literally every task i have to accomplish a day. That includes walking writing everything just everything. I also never know who i am. I always feel disconected from people even ones i know and am constantly switching when i see a person or even an animal. So it is quite literally impossible to form relationships with anyone atm. I am 17 yrs old. Trama started 12-16. I also have little to  no feelings or emotions for my old life nor any of my friends. Basicaly my question is that is anyone else going throughthe same thing? DID is one thing but because i have so many parts i cant really get to know my other personality clusters. I feel very lonely with this at times. A response would be greatly appreciated 
-2	negative	emotional-health	Hi everyone, this is a blog I recently wrote about my experience with some not-nice extroverts:  Lion
-3	negative	emotional-health	High school - a place filled with labels.  Gah! It's really frustrating being labeled so easily when the labels are completely opposite of what I am! (Sorry I just really needed to vent )
-2	negative	emotional-health	Hi have a good day it going to be a nice day today
-3	negative	emotional-health	Hi. If you want to chat with me then message me. I would like to get some messages from you all.
-4	negative	emotional-health	Hi. I'm currently an eighth-grader getting ready for high-school. My grades are above-average, and I have no problems in school whatsoever. I study and even get fairly decent scores on my tests. Because of this, my friends and relatives always praise me for being so "smart." But I believe that isn't the case.     I just feel so disappointed in myself, and I'm no longer optimistic about things.. Has something similar happened to you? Sorry this is so long! :&lt;
-14	negative	emotional-health	Hi. I used to have a crush on a guy that i thought he liked me back. We talk everyday and he flirted sometimes. I told my bestfriend about this and she supported me. I told her everything about him.  First few days in high school were very hard. We went to a different school. I wanted to forget him but he kept sending me sms and flirted again. I deleted him then and we never talked 'til now.
-8	negative	emotional-health	Hi my husband came out of detox last weekend for opiate addiction. He became addicted after being prescribed pain pills for chronic back pain. When I picked him up last Saturday he was ready to start fresh. He just told me this morning that he has been using pills since the evening he got home but ran out last night and is going through withdrawal again now. Any advice on where to go from here? He is scheduled to go to an intensive outpatient program appointment on Monday. He really wants to stop but is having a hard time dealing with the demons that the pills have caused. I'm at a complete loss for words and don't know where to turn. I'm afraid to tell my family what happened as I don't want then to think differently of him. Thank you.
-6	negative	emotional-health	His name is Eugene (Gene) and he stole my heart first time we met which was 4 years ago. I never thought I was going to love him as much as I do now.  I love you Gene &lt;3
-4	negative	emotional-health	Hi there can you help me please? I'm going to be starting an OU course next week to try and better my life you have to try don't you ? I no it's going to be hard work I no I will feel like a dunce some times especially being dyslexic. I could do with some support well a bit of motivation thanks I hope you all have a good 2014
-4	negative	emotional-health	Hi, this is my first post on here I would like to say a few things, first I have NO friends what so ever, secondly I have been diagnosed with autism / aspergers, I don't mean to be but am very lazy parents so your a fat retard etc.  People find me annoying and way leave a comment or message me :-)
-7	negative	emotional-health	Honestly, I never thought that I was sad until other people told me. I never knew that the things I felt were not typical. I never knew that I was "negative." Now that I know, it consumes me. 
-2	negative	emotional-health	Honestly, the biggest influence I  have is David Bowie. And I don't even know him personally, as much as I wish I did. It makes me lonely to feel so close to someone and yet so impossibly far. 
-7	negative	emotional-health	How can I expect someone to want me physically when I, myself don't even like the way I look. Men are so visual. I've found that most men prefer not to be with bigger women. I know it's important to be with someone that loves you for who you are, but let's face it, there has to be some initial attraction. I know you can't tell from my pic, but I have a lot of weight to lose. I'm invisible to men. Losing weight is so hard and keeping it off is even harder. Any advice or tips would be nice. Thank you : )
-1	negative	emotional-health	How DO they get that white stuff on the inside of twinkies?
-2	negative	emotional-health	How do you forgive someone? I need help.
-3	negative	emotional-health	How do you get a man to hear the things in your heart when he won't listen to the things your mouth says?
-19	negative	emotional-health	How should I take this?! So this guy was talking to me for two months we hit it off great! I am 24 and he is 28. Talked and hung out all the time. He was leaving for college on Friday. On Tuesday he asked me to go out with him in the sweetest way. Of course I said yes. We went out on a couple of dates things were going great! So I thought. Then Friday came and he wouldn't speak to me. I showed up at his work knowing he would be there and he completely ignored me! After I left he texted me good luck with his life his feelings have changed and he is no longer interested in talking to me anymore! I was completely shocked and have no idea what went wrong. I haven't talked to him since I'm heartbroken and missing him. What should I do?! How should I take his text?
-23	negative	emotional-health	Hung out with a guy today other than my MM, first time in 8 months since I spent any alone time with another man. He was very nice and seems to have a lot of qualities I look for in someone to date, but all I can think about now is my MM who's company I love the most, who I'm sure is happily home tonight with his wife and child..  Feeling torn.  Who knows if I will even see todays guy again, I seem to be a one date wonder, but this was the first one in years that had any prospects for a relationship of my own.  Just feeling torn torn torn. Ug!  Maybe the reality of meeting someone I really like right now is just scary, what if I just met the guy I've waited for my whole life and here I am not excited about it because I love someone else.  Someone I have no desire to have any more from than the relationship we have. Maybe I just need time to get excited about todays guy, or maybe he'll never call.  I guess I kinda hope he calls.
-4	negative	emotional-health	I absolutely love being in the sun when I am flowering, gardening, swimming, or sunbathing too.  I love being outdoors more than inside.  I love to walk, run, BBQ, and play sports often when outside.  
-3	negative	emotional-health	I always believe that we humans (even animals) have inherent nature to care for other people. We all are born with this quality. If is just after the social conditioning that we somehow suppress this quality. Some of us become emotionless. Some of us become too emotional. Most of us are get engaged in their own world and dont care about other people. But whatever be the case, we all are inherited with the quality to care about other people. Most of just ignore that. 
-1	negative	emotional-health	I always give up on everything, there is nothing I finished, nothing.  I gave up on everything but one thing, languages, I will never ever ever give up on that.
-5	negative	emotional-health	I always saved my father's voicemails. 9 months ago he killed himself, and today I found out that my phone company deleted all his old messages when I switched phones.  It just seems so stupid and silly and unfair. 
-7	negative	emotional-health	I always try my best do the most I can. My world I'd just up side up. What I want is so far away and what I have is not satisfying. Never imagined my life would be this boring and meaningless. It's so unfair . I want to scream
-4	negative	emotional-health	I always try to smile when I'm around people, sometimes its hard cause they can tell I'm faking a smile :/
-2	negative	emotional-health	I always wish that I said more. That I told someone how I felt. I constantly live in the what ifs. I regret not loving deeper, standing taller, and not speaking my mind.
-5	negative	emotional-health	I am 13 years old, I have my own laptop, smartphone, 49 pairs of high end shoes (nikes, uggs, adidas, etc.), a tv in my room, countless clothes/jackets(blazers and north face, etc.), my own pet, tempurpedic bed, real pearl earings, endless amount of books, high end makeup, updated technology, and other stuff too, but the thing is I do not brag for what i have or try to show off. Overall, i think i am spoiled but not so much of a brat.
-5	negative	emotional-health	I am 16 all guys our there kissed somebody but i havent kissed its because i am nerdy every one has a gf but i havent guess i will be alone forever and ever
-3	negative	emotional-health	I am 210pounds and am 5'6.obviously am over weight is there an effective work out plan?what foods should I avoid?i want to be 180lbs by July.
-1	negative	emotional-health	I am 214lbs and trying to join the USAF. I need to be 179lbs before I can join based on my hight. Any tips?
-5	negative	emotional-health	I am 23 years old and I've never been in a real or long term relationship. I've dated but nothing seem to get passed 3 months. I'm attractive, independent and smart. I speak 3 languages and currently pursuing a bachelors in biology with plans to proceed to medical school. So I don't know what is the problem why can't my relationship last I thought I was the complete package but I guess I'm wrong.
-1	negative	emotional-health	I am 5'6 104 pounds, and have anorexia and bulimia.
-1	negative	emotional-health	I am a chatterbox. I talk and talk but I feel as if no one listens. I wish I could find just one person in my life who listens to me. My friends don't, my parents don't and well nobody else does so
-4	negative	emotional-health	I am a fat chick Who just want's to help out because big girls aren't ugly just because they are fat. Our Heart's feel everything were normal people not beasts. we feel, we love, we hurt. being big, plus sized, or  fat means nothing. because WE ARE ALL HUMAN! 
-2	negative	emotional-health	I am a huge people pleaser. If I don't please someone or I disappoint, I fall into a deep depression. I am terrified of doing the wrong thing.
-9	negative	emotional-health	I am a human , a man with a dream , a life span of many years . I hold myself true to the law my soul has made for myself. Though i like to find myself worthy of being a citizen in the country that is myself. i find myself breaking some rules. I never once have understood some laws. This being because i never had to feel a type of emotion that goes with that law. I find my mind pushing me in a cage with no light or air . yet i don't understand my charge , so trapped in this cage my heart shall stay . till i once again become innocent of such things. However for this crime i have hurt others. For that another crime against my nation is again pressed upon me . Again i ask , am i a man  or a beast . The two fight inside this cell , the cage that is my hearts home. I shall serve my sentience for i am only human. A man who makes mistakes , even when not intentional . we humans can be so cruel to our self's especially in the matter of the heart , so so cruel .
-1	negative	emotional-health	I am a little bit spoiled because I grew up that way. They all treat me like their princess. And I always want to get whatever I wanted.
-4	negative	emotional-health	I am a person who dreams a lot. Dreams like going to Harvard when I get B and C's in math. Dreams like joining the military when barely can do a push up. Dreams like having the person I love when I am so ugly. I am weak, dumb and ugly. I imagine stuff all the time. I am scared of the future. I work really hard to get a good mark. HARD WORK DOESN'T PAY OF FOR ME. Sometimes life seems so hard when you are constantly failing.
-11	negative	emotional-health	I am a quiet person in the respect that I do not socialize with people I can go an entire semester in a class and not talk to anyone in the class. It is kind if a bad thing because people find it hard to approach me. And the friends that I did have left because I just don't talk much. But the plus side to me being quiet and unnoticed it allows me to see people for who they really are
-19	negative	emotional-health	I am at it again today. Just thinking again and letting my mind get the best of me. As I think I mentioned in my earlier post, my MM is on vacation this week so I have not seen him which always does this to me. His wife took the week off too, which just further complicates my emotions. His communications with me are scarce during these times and I find it hard to hang on to the positives and not dwell on the negatives. This is just a place for me to write it all down in a little lock box where no one who knows me will ever find it..  I know he loves me, and I dont know what will happen to us.. I am just bitter and sad and hurting today. I can't wait until this is over. Not just this week either, this whole thing. If we work out or not, I want my life to continue.. I'd just like it to be with him 
-12	negative	emotional-health	I am a ugly person compared to the other girls. i wish that i was cute as them so i could have friends and never be alone. All I am in peoples eyes is a black buck teeth four eyed girl and that is what I believe I am. I get called ugly by my sister, I am a laughing stock, and not to mention i am not smart like people say I am. 
-6	negative	emotional-health	I am constantly seeking everyone's approval. Always trying to look the right way, weigh the right number. Trying to be this person that everyone wants me too be. I hate it when I dissapoint someone, it physically hurts.
-11	negative	emotional-health	I am dating and can't seem to open up. I wish I could just tell him I feel vulnerable around him. That our backgrounds are completely different. I struggled for the life I am living, to be heard, to be appreciated, to be opinionated about things I want for myself. I struggle with being the quiet, composed girl that I was brought up to be with the assertive, strong willed person I am. I need to find a balance and it's hard to share this unusual dilemma with another person. How can I have him understand this? I want it to work but I think he's giving up on me. How can he not? There has been no progress. My emotional emptiness has seized the unity I was hoping to mold.
-1	negative	emotional-health	I am doing a little better but still struggle to keep the fake smile on my face everyday.
-3	negative	emotional-health	I am extremely depressed all the time I just am not happy with myself I feel so worthless all the time and I question my purpose. I am strong in my faith and am thankful for my existence because I know I have so much to be thankful for but that doesn't stop the feelings of anger and depression I have..
-2	negative	emotional-health	I am going through the hardest situation I will ever go through at this moment.
-5	negative	emotional-health	I am going through therapy.  I attend group meetings and whoa lets talk about severe flashbacks happening. I am almost afraid of spending time alone with myself. I need constant distractions to keep my thoughts occupied. Now even that is not working. Poof .just like that. No advance warning without explanation my head is playing a full movie of an event I am not even sure if I lived. It's me but was it an actual event or just my mind playing tricks on me. I don't know and I don't really want to know. I am ok with not paying attention to those unknown issues. I have no problem with denial in this case. I am hopeful I can move onyet seems like moving on means going way back first and if I hid it in a deep dark place. Maybe it just needs to stay there. 
-4	negative	emotional-health	I am going thru a huge life experience and nothing will ever be the same.   I know that my A will never be the same either.  I am thinking about ending it now to get all the pain over with in every area so that I can focus and me and my kids.  But it is so so difficult and I feel very lonely.
-7	negative	emotional-health	I am in love with this mandeeply, intensely, limitlessly. He is my soul-mate, my best friend, my world. We have been in each others' lives for 3.5 years, and I never thought we would have ended up like this. It was supposed to be a friendship and nothing more..then later, a 'fling' which I thought would die. Instead he has transformed my world by exposing the voids I had in my now defunct marriage, by making me want to be a better person and for the first time in my life by making me feel loved with a depth I never thought possible.  
-9	negative	emotional-health	I am married but there is nothin there. I do what he tells me to do. I live the way he wants me to live. I want someone who will actually talk to me and want to know me. I want to know them. I want to listen and here them out. I am here with 3 kids, a husband, a dog, a guinea pig, and a rabbit and I am lonely.
-8	negative	emotional-health	I am new to EP and I am thankful I found a group of ladies that empathise and have an understanding of what we are all going through, regardless of the nature of our relationships. However I recently found a inappropriate  post from a bitter angry wife directing us to a blog  that I found appalling. I can't reply as this poster has block me due to what I can gather as a case of dishing it out however can't take it. I have flagged this post and hopefully EP will take it down. For those of you that have read it and find it negative and appalling DONT apologise it is offensive and non supportive. Enjoy your MM if he brings you happiness, find peace, clarity and strength if you are trying to get out, above all be happy within yourself don't let anyone drag you down to their level. 
-8	negative	emotional-health	I am no longer the other woman. I ended it for good this time. I asked him to respect my wishes and he said okay. I told him that even if I contact him in the future he needs to ignore me. It has hurt too much to be with him and as much as it hurts to end it, I need to move on. Thank you all for the support you have provided over the last year.
-2	negative	emotional-health	I am not a deep thinker and neither are you. No deep thinker actually wastes time pondering themselves and how deep they are thinking. Arrogant shallow thinkers may think they are deep thinkers.  As it says in the Tao Te Chi: those who know don't say; those who say don't know.
-1	negative	emotional-health	I am not who I was, and I don't know how it happened.  I want her back.
-8	negative	emotional-health	I am now meeting with my old boss on a more personal level. He is straight, married, and a devout Christian. I am bisexual, single, Catholic, and admittedly really into him. We are trying to both open up and build a connection but I am struggling with what to say or how much to divulge. He says no judgement but I don't know? Do I tell him I am bisexual or curious? Do I open up and tell him about my emotional past or how I long to have a close relationship with someone I really trust?  What should I do? I want to keep the relationship but go deeper
-3	negative	emotional-health	I am petite and slender, 4'9" and 105pounds. Only 10 pounds away from pre-baby weight of 95pds! I mostly hate being small when trying to reach stuff. When shopping by myself I sometimes have to climb shelves if I can't get any assistance. A year ago I started wearing 3in. Hidden wedge sneakers and this helps out a bit. My husband is also petite, he is 5'4" and likes how tall I make him look!
-1	negative	emotional-health	I am rather short. Slightly chubby. But the best part is getting to date taller guys  I'm a sucker for tall guys. Especially ones with cute eyes and a cute smile. Ugh. I miss him.
-1	negative	emotional-health	I am so tired of being tired. Being lonely. Being depressed. &lt;/3 - Forever Broken
-5	negative	emotional-health	I am such a good, sweet person. But sometimes, that little button gets pushed and I flip. I am not a violent person. But sometimes I want to punch someone in the face till they look like Voldemort..
-2	negative	emotional-health	I am the apologizing queen. I say I'm sorry even when I don't need to. I'm working on this.
-1	negative	emotional-health	I am tired of everything, I am always bored and nothing/no one cheers me up! I want desperately to move to a place where people can understand me. I wish I could just go away without looking back! I want to have real friends. Friends who can listen to me as I do with others. Unfortunately I can't leave my family! This is a prison and I can't escape 
-4	negative	emotional-health	I am tired of living..its funny to say that, because I am only 19 years old and I have a lot to do in my life. But the fact is I cant live in this world anymore. Some people are always talking about kindness, but they never show it. Some of them are like trained creatures used to live for spending life by achieving non-reasonable goals. They feel high, but they do not understand the essence of being and are ignoring most of sensitive signals which come from human and environment overall. Thats the reason why Im tired of living.
-2	negative	emotional-health	I am trying very hard nowadays to lose weight. I want to lose 30 lbs in 2 months .i worked out whole day but now suffering from back ache.
-1	negative	emotional-health	I am watching the birds flying, Work hard.
-1	negative	emotional-health	I am willing to do anything to become rich so me and my partner can live a good life
-4	negative	emotional-health	I am without question a curvy girl! Years ago I was much smaller, and I suppose I have always been a yoyo kind of gal, but never one to go to extreme dieting I usually incorporated exercise into my routine.  I own it!
-1	negative	emotional-health	i apologize a lot and then people yell at me so i apologize more. its terrible but i cant help it
-5	negative	emotional-health	I become emotionally attached to anything way too easily. I was playing Minecraft with my fianc the other day. Long story short, I tamed a wolf (named him and everything) and after about half an hour he died and I must have cried for at least an hour.
-18	negative	emotional-health	I been hurting all day. I've been in bed all day. I'm in my bed with my blankets over my head cause I'm freezing. Its 15 degrees outside sometimes ten its not very warm inside. Heating doesn't work so well.. And I sleep next to a frozen window and its extra cold by my bed. Marcus goes "what are you doing under the blanket?" (I was playing Nintendo Ds) I said "I'm under the blanket us my breath makes it hot and it helps keep me warm." he climbs in bed. Tells me to put my arm around him. One hand typing. Got my arm out without wake him Jake helped me out. I'm laying with Jake now. I hope he's not mad I left him when he wakes up in the morning 
-1	negative	emotional-health	I believe I am not the only one that have to face this situation. I sometimes feel like crying without any reasons. I don't know what's bothering me. I just feel like crying and I did crying after some thoughts. 
-9	negative	emotional-health	I Believe That People Feel That I'm Annoying. People Have Told Me I'm Annoying. I Can't Help It, That's Just How I Am. People End Up Not Talking To Me Anymore Or Responding To Any Of My Texts, Then I Get Sad & Depressed And Say "what did I say that was wrong?" . I Also Believe That People Feel That I'm A Lame Person, Because I Don't Hang Out With Certain People Or Do Certain Things.
-4	negative	emotional-health	I believe the pain I've experienced has granted me super powers.  For the pain has allowed me to experience things within myself I wouldn't have otherwise known.
-2	negative	emotional-health	I can be extremely negative and sarcastic it's a part of my personality I'm actually kinda annoyed by super positive people
-1	negative	emotional-health	I can be very childish whenever I want to.
-9	negative	emotional-health	I can generally go wherever and do whatever I want. Obviously I can't tell the future and don't know what will be best, just that I will make it work. Action is generally better than inaction but sometimes I think it's best to wait for the moment to be right. Still major decisions stress me out
-1	negative	emotional-health	I cannot explain it. A dolled up husk in a world which has lost it's mystery.
-2	negative	emotional-health	I cannot express myself. I don't know how I am feeling. I don't  know what to write now to say what I want to say. Low knowledge of words may be. Still can't figure out how to say what my mind is saying
-1	negative	emotional-health	I can show how I feel through my eyes I can keep my emotions bottled up but I shouldn't because it leads to me arguing with my sister
-2	negative	emotional-health	I can't eat..it feels like this weight that's put on my body that pulls me down deeper and deeper into this black hole. It's okay that my stomach hurts..as long as it not from being full of food. 
-3	negative	emotional-health	I can't have a steady life. Not a steady boy friend or a steady activity. This demon pushes every joy I have away from me. I actually thought Sam would be one who I could stick with but the demon is too strong. This only shows that I have more battles on the way
-3	negative	emotional-health	I cant sleeeeeep this is awful . It's my vacation time and I'm awake at 5:30am like why ?!?  I strongly dislike this . :|
-11	negative	emotional-health	I constantly read into things. For instance, A total stranger will catch my eye and I wonder what kind of life they live? The expressions they have upon their face makes me wonder, are they happy? Are they sad? Have they had a hard life? What kind of family do they have? All sorts of thing go through my head. There are so many ways of living. So many beliefs and so many customs. Billions of people roam this earth. We are all so different, but are there areas where we are the same too? Hmm?
-4	negative	emotional-health	I crave someone who I can share my soul with. Someone who understands and can provoke thoughts and expand my horizons. Nothing sounds better than a warm embrace combined with intellectual conversation.
-1	negative	emotional-health	I daydream. I dream so strongly that my imagination becomes more tangible than reality. I'm afraid of the day that I realise it's all pretend. It might not be completely bad. At least I will be living my own life instead of the lives of the people inside my head but I think I'd rather be one of them.
-10	negative	emotional-health	I deal with depression most daysand I really couldn't tell you why. I have a past - we all do - and there are unpleasant memories there. Until I met my girlfriend (who might as well be my wife, even though neither of us will get married again), life had taught me that people are disposable. Walk away first, because sooner or later, they will. My girl taught me the meaning of unconditional love - to keep loving and holding on, NO MATTER WHAT. It's hard to get over my old mindset, though. I tried leaving a number of times, believing her life would be better without me in it. It didn't work; she always found a way to bring me back.  Wonder if there's a way to let go of worry, and just be happy
-6	negative	emotional-health	I decided I wanted to live a healthier life when I discovered that I was slightly overweight by my state's standards. I think it's a little unfair because I'm pretty short and I also have a "thick" body type with more natural muscle and curves. I've tried working out but it's hard for me to lose weight since I'm not necessarily really fat. The least I can start doing is carefully watching my portions and eating healthier, along with daily excersise. One thing I also struggle with is finding the  motivation everyday! I'm not too concerned with losing weight, my main goals are just to be toned and to eat better so I feel better.
-5	negative	emotional-health	I describe myself as an open book and a blunt one at that. I am always looking for new experiences and to push my boundaries when it comes to old experiences. I love meeting new people from all over the world, so I definitely love to travel. 
-7	negative	emotional-health	I developed aggression to what I used to fear. I used to feel paralyzed. Now I usually feel hostile towards whatever fear-ghost my mind considers. Last night it didn't come though. I turned the key and only felt a gentle, rumbling protest. I was alone with long-forgotten fears. They were so familiar. How much have I developed around them? Seeing no warm courage I thought it out. Considered possibilities, the worst cases, and felt okay. In between horror and rage lives acceptance.
-13	negative	emotional-health	I did exactly this today, when I finally got hold of him. I guess he was sleeping, but I went on and on bout how he is abandoning mebecause I went 12 hours without being able to talk to him. There is more to it than thisbut to make a very long story shortI will just say that I am a complete nutjob, and I am insecure and have mommy issues and abandonment issues and trust issuesand prolly many more. I am crazy. He is still thereand he listened to my rant and still loves meeven though he hasn't called me back yet.
-4	negative	emotional-health	Idk if I'm just having a moment. But it's starting to become apparent that others view me differently from how I view myself. Idkit's weird.
-7	negative	emotional-health	I do find it very interesting how EP members decide who they want to support people.  They also EP members decide which members they don't want to support.  I'm expecting nothing from this post, I just wanted to express my thoughts and what I think about this site. 
-1	negative	emotional-health	I do, I know this not relevant, The frozen song- Let it go is exactly what i feel like and did. I pretended I was okay. I didn't care. I keep things. I have a really complicated life that Noone, NOONE knows about. I keep it to my self. Because I keep things bottled up I can be really moody and at school its helped me get in a huge amounts of trouble. I don't get sad, I get angry. I don't cry. Is anyone else in the same boat?
-3	negative	emotional-health	I don't even know where to start. But why do I fall in love with straight girls? Hiding my sexuality ? Hiding the fact that I love to smoke ? I just wanna roll one and take a walk in the cold air 
-1	negative	emotional-health	I don't experience and process emotions the way most people do. I need someone who embraces their emotions, who can recognize and state how they're feeling so that they balance me out. I'm intrigued by the concept of the human emotional experience and it's something I wish to know first hand, but I've blocked myself off from it while I was young. I need someone stronger than I am to teach me how to accept reality on an emotional level.
-2	negative	emotional-health	I don't fear death because it can come at anytime. I just what I love to do with the time I have, and I'll continue to do those things until I can't and I'll die happy. 
-3	negative	emotional-health	I don't feel left out I am left out, most of the girls call me a runt or a mistake cuz my parents  were never really married
-9	negative	emotional-health	I don't feel the need to post all of my trials and tribulations. I do feel as if all that I have been through in life has made me the person I am today. You can't grow unless you learn. Whether you learn from your mistakes or your success, you are learning which causes you to grow and become stronger. As humans we don't give ourselves much credit, we are naturally resilient. If something happens to us we are capable of coming back better and stronger we just have to find out inner a strength and believe in it.
-8	negative	emotional-health	I don't get it. Why won't he email me back? This guy I like, trying NOT to like won't respond to my emails. I emailed him 2 months ago to thank him for giving me a ride home - no response. I emailed him New Year's Eve to wish him all the best in the upcoming year - no response. He's not usually so disrespectful like that. it just makes me sad that i still have his Xmas gift still here maybe I should just dump it. I don't know what gives. And yes I have the correct email.
-5	negative	emotional-health	I don't have many friends, I'm pretty reserved and shy. I don't know why people don't flock to me like other people.. i'm not a creep or anything ? I'm weird, but a good weird. I'm a caring person and if I care about you.. I care a lot. I'm a loving person, i love with all my heart . Why doesn't anyone want me ? I'm not artificial at all, yea I love fashion.. but i look past all that when it comes to people. Looks don't really matter to me, all that matters is your personality.. i like people who have depth to them.. isn't that a good thing ? So, why doesn't anyone want me ?
-4	negative	emotional-health	i dont know but i prefer observing things than being noisy. I observe things oftenly i think its my hobby?
-3	negative	emotional-health	i dont know what it is but i really want it?
-7	negative	emotional-health	I dont know what I want. I confuse myself. I always change my mind. Its difficult. But I guess thats just part of being young, you dont know what you want and you dont understand life.
-2	negative	emotional-health	i dont know whats wrong with me..  where did i go?
-3	negative	emotional-health	i dont know what to do. - so i had this boyfriend , we dont date anymore. but i cant seem to get him out of my head. the memories just keep coming back. i really want them gone. but i cant let go. why?
-8	negative	emotional-health	I dont know what to say, but I am awkward. When I talk with my friends, I said one thing, funny or not, and "BAAAAM" it's awkward. And also, some people think I am funny, just because I am awkward, but if I said a funny joke, no one laugh.  So, i dont know what to say, Well, I am socially awkward.  
-2	negative	emotional-health	I dont know why I feel so lost. So crazy. So disgusting. So huge and so stupid. I know I dont have it as bad as some. But I still feel the weight of my thoughts. I have nowhere to put them. 
-2	negative	emotional-health	I don't like that about myself. When im presenting in class im like "i can do this" but once im up there all of a sudden i forget what im going too say and uuugh its so frustrating!!! Then i start shaking and jeez i need to stop being so shy. Ive missed a lot of opportunities in my life fir being so shy 
-2	negative	emotional-health	I don't like to be close to a lot of people. I trust people to a point and thats it.  I always got close to people and always ended up getting hurt, even by family.If I am close to someone enough to go to them about my problems or ask them for help for advice or something then they are very special to me cause I know they won't hurt me.
-1	negative	emotional-health	I don't think, I know. I just hope there's a time where it doesn't bother me.
-1	negative	emotional-health	I don't understand what's wrong with me. Why an I so shy? Why am I have social anxiety sometimes? Why do I have such low self-esteem. There are a lot if things I pride myself in, but the one thing that holds me back from being 100% happy is my low confidence and shyness. I just don't know what to do.
-2	negative	emotional-health	I don't wanna seem like I Love to be the center of attention, but I honestly realize I'm not 100% the same unless I have someone who actually cares for me and helps me.. I need more than one person a single person's attention isn't enough.. I carve more attention and hopefully I can stop being depressed Hopefully.. (Sigh)
-1	negative	emotional-health	I don't wanna sleep but I have to Does anyone now how to make yourself tired? .-.
-6	negative	emotional-health	I don't want someone to need me. I just want to be wanted. Bad childhood and trusting the wrong people have made me isolate myself more or less. Now for the most part I like my alone time. Still I'm human and there's times in which I want someone waiting to talk with me. Or wanting my attention. No matter how much I try to eliminate these feelings they sneak up on me. 
-1	negative	emotional-health	I don't want to keep going.. I just want to give up.. Nothing can ever go right for me.. I hate my present life and am scared of what the future is gonna bring.. I want to throw the towel in and give up everything.. I feel so lifeless..
-4	negative	emotional-health	I do think I'm going crazy, it's a complicated thought though. It's just kind of hard to describe why because it's all in my head and it makes sense there but not in word form
-1	negative	emotional-health	I do this allllll the time. To hide how much pain I am in. To hide all the crying and cutting I did the night before. I smile when I'm sad to hide everything.
-7	negative	emotional-health	I feel like a 40 year old man in high school. From the types of music that I like down to my views on politics (Yes, even though I'm a teen, I have insight on more serious matters). It just seems like everyone within my class is much more different than I am. I actually have a plan on what I want to do later on after high school. What profession I want to go into, and more. 
-2	negative	emotional-health	I feel like I am screaming and no one is hearing me. I am out of control and desperate for someone to be here for me right now. I am so confused. I am so lost. nobody in my life understands me right now, I don't understand me right now. I don't know where to start to get myself back together. everything is falling apart and I'm almost ready to just give up and let it all take over.
-1	negative	emotional-health	I feel like I don't have friends or a life because of my personality. Bleh. I used to have friends. But then I gained weight and all of a sudden people just pushed me away.. I wish I could be accepted, by someone, anyone. I'm also weird. Maybe that's what makes me, me.
-1	negative	emotional-health	I feel like I have to be fake and pretend around everyone in my life. I don't want to upset my parents or scare away my boyfriend. I'm super quiet because I never feel like I have anything to say or like no one really cares what I have to say and just thinks I'm incredibly annoying. I also hardly ever have anything positive to say. I feel like all the "happy" people out there in the world are just choosing to disillusion themselves.. I just cry and smoke weed alone every day. I feel like I'm wasting my life and don't want to be here most of the time. I can't actually remember the last time I was happy for real..
-2	negative	emotional-health	I feel like i look terrible in pictures! I love taking them and being in them i just look bad..
-5	negative	emotional-health	I feel like I'm losing it. We are all still at that in between phase, where he has left her but still isn't sure what he wants. It's a struggle on every end and it kills me to see him like this. Sunday morning him and her got into a fight so bad he called off work and came running to me, just having a break down. It's all starting to get really, really bad. I don't know. I need advice.
-2	negative	emotional-health	I feel like I need someone who I could talk to and tell them everything I've been through. I want someone who can completely understand me. Keeping emotions all bottled up is so tiring.
-2	negative	emotional-health	I feel like things are piling up recently. I need help sorting through it but I don't know who to turn to. I know I have plenty of family and friends that would lend an ear but I don't know how to express the things I'm feeling and why
-6	negative	emotional-health	I feel lost. Im numb to everything. Im demotivated, frustrated, broken.. You name it. I cant do anything I love anymore. I cant get my life together. He took a part of me and i feel like im someone else. I cant do anything right, nothing feeels right anymore. I cant remember what I was like before him and Idk how to do it.. To find myself. I got used to the darkness within, the sorrow im in and I dont like it. I wana snap out of it and its so hard. I wana start fresh, do the things I love and actually feel the joy. How do people do that? Do they pretend? Even that doesnt last too long. How do I live again?
-1	negative	emotional-health	I feel so full of emotions all the time. They range and rage on and sometimes I'm not sure how I feel about most anything. I feel like I'm constantly thinking and feeling, so much so that it's hard for me to meditate. All of my emotions no matter what they are are always so intense.. I feel like I have so many feelings and not enough room for them in my soul.. It's. Just. A lot!
-2	negative	emotional-health	I feel so lonely. I feel like my life would be much better if I had someone. I can imagine it now. The feeling of excitement in the pit of my stomach when he calls. The way I feel when he kisses me and I feel like nothing else in the world matters. I know he will come someday, or maybe multiple someones, but I want THE ONE.  I'm not naive enough to say that there is a perfect guy out there for me. But I can't help wishing for him
-6	negative	emotional-health	I feel so lost all the time. There are two sides of who I am. The side where I can possible try to forget everything and live my life and laugh have fun, without people knowing how I really am, and my real feelings.    I find it so hard to sleep at night unless I'm exhausted through out the day. The amount of thoughts that just run through my mind just come back as I'm on the quiet and alone. It's that time I feel like I was someone to comfort me and tell me "everything going to be alright".
-1	negative	emotional-health	If I fail the test, I honestly don't know what else I'll do with my life. I have no degree, no stable work history, no money, and a certain type of felony that mars my reputation like an ugly, pustulating open sore that begs to overshadow everything else, the one type of felony that this society seems to find the most deplorable. They haven't felt my tears. 
-4	negative	emotional-health	I finally started working out today! My friend and I went to a local pool and did some laps. I always forget how much energy exercising actually gives you. It seems so backwards, but hey, I'm not going to argue with a good thing!!
-3	negative	emotional-health	I find most of my friends my age are still stuck in the "pizza and clubbing" stage in development, which kind of pushes me to hang out with older people, around 21-24 years old. It helps that I'm ridiculously tall, bearded, deep-voiced and well-spoken, but my age is still a handicap when it comes to dating due to most women's habit of only dating older men. On the other hand, I can't really complain due to my own preference for (slightly) older women, but I digress. In brief, most people believe me to be 23 when I am in fact 19, which is flattering, but has never actually worked in my favor. It just kind of leaves me trapped in a college program where I feel more like I'm minding children than interacting with my peers.
-3	negative	emotional-health	If only you could spend an afternoon in my mind. To see what I think, what I want, what I enjoy, what I need.  
-3	negative	emotional-health	I forget how lucky I am, as I sit here feeling it cos I didn't get my call tonight. I am so greatful that I hear his voice 9 nights out of 10 and I appreciate that it is not the same for everyone and I spare a thought tonight for all you out there who only hear their mans voice once a week. Have a bright hopeful New Year!
-10	negative	emotional-health	I found some old pants (The reason I hid them in my closet was that they're pretty torn and there's huge holes everywhere.)..I used to wear these like..2 years ago and so I put them on thinking nothing of it. Then I realized that my belly was spilling over the top and resting there.. round and softI've gained these past years without noticing!  A pretty nice feeling   I just woke up and now I'm stuffing myself with food. Motivation lol! 
-1	negative	emotional-health	 Is Anything Real? A little something to ponder upon 
-1	negative	emotional-health	If you are a wife thinking about cheating on your husband..message me.  I am a husband thinking about cheating on my wife.  Lets talk about it together.
-4	negative	emotional-health	If you could close your eyes and touched my heart, feel my pain. Would you try to understand what I'm feeling or is another one's pain so meaningless to you, because it's not your own. When you can look through the eyes of another and feel there pain, accept this gift as a gift from God.
-4	negative	emotional-health	If you're reading this you'll know. This site helps Who knew.
-1	negative	emotional-health	If your going to have a long monogamist relationship. This is something you need to know.
-7	negative	emotional-health	If youve read my post before youll know that my MM and i have broken up and had NC for three months.. But then now, we are together again.. Hes the one who initiated contact. Tried to go the other way but then my love for him got the best of me.. What do u think?
-7	negative	emotional-health	"If you would be a man, speak today what you think today in words as hard as cannon-balls, and tomorrow speak what tomorrow thinks in hard words again, though it contradict everything you said today"I agree with Emerson.  Be sincere or be silent. Speak the whole truth as you see it, or do not speak at all. Be fully yourself at all times.
-2	negative	emotional-health	I gave one girl 3 chances to be with me, she blew all if them because of her friends. Moral is don't give away something that won't last.
-3	negative	emotional-health	I get happy, I get excited, and all the positive emotions you can think of but I get sad too maybe more often than anyone can be.. but it's who i am! I'm allowed to feel what i feel, and honestly, since I'm going through something, it really hurts more to be pressured and be told what to feel! 
-8	negative	emotional-health	I get ignored quite frequently. Mainly it's by my friends. We'll be talking and while I'm saying something they either won't hear it or will have another conversation while I'm still talking. Sometimes I feel ignored when we're walk. I will sometimes be left out if the group and just linger behind them. It makes me feel upset sometimes and I tend to overthink the situation and try to tell myself something that it may not be. I just really hate being ignored and I just want someone to listen when I talk.
-2	negative	emotional-health	I guess I feel I have this duty to be strong for everyone around me. I'm selfless when it comes to how others feel, a lot of the time I sacrifice my own happiness or unhappiness to brighten someone else's day. I care a lot about others Sometimes I wonder who will be strong for me That's why I usually keep my pain to myself or shrug it off when I'm asked about it.
-6	negative	emotional-health	I guess that talk the other day really helped.  I have found myself not getting so antsy or blowing up over the littlest things.  In fact I've noticed that we have talked more and by talking I mean just that talking about life in general. I'm just happy, I'm happy that I was brave enough to say what had to be said and happy that it has helped so far.  
-2	negative	emotional-health	I guess this one doesn't really "count", as it was a hospital death. Anyways, my grandma had some sort of disease affecting her lungs and she was in a medical ventilator. My family decided to pull the plug, which makes sense as she was pretty much brain dead at the time, and the doctors couldn't do anything to "save" her. So I guess I didn't really watch someone die, I just saw air flow out of a mechanically respirating corpse.
-10	negative	emotional-health	I had always suspected I had a problem with lying, but I never knew what kind of problem it really was. The lies happen before my brain has a chance to catch up. They come out, and it only taken a second to realize that I have no idea why I said the thing I just said. I'm terrible.
-2	negative	emotional-health	I had Harry but he is gone. Now I'm alone to bare the pain
-1	negative	emotional-health	I had it before but let it go and now I miss it
-7	negative	emotional-health	I had nose bleed seats at a hockey game and I fell down the stairs on the way to my seat. The worst part was that my mom was walking ahead of me and didn't notice I fell, so an elderly man had to help me up 
-1	negative	emotional-health	I hate days when I'm feeling down and I no one to talk to "sigh" ( ._.).
-2	negative	emotional-health	I hate everythingwell almost everythingmy mother who was never there for me and still is not has become there for all my friends but me!.I cant stand being around here when she is drinking which is all the time!
-6	negative	emotional-health	I hate it when people judge somebody right away, people where I live see that I am a teenager who skateboards and seem to think that I am this idiot doing nothing with my life. Meanwhile I am staying on at school doing five highers and hopefully going to university some day. In fact one night my friends and I were skating back from the skatepark and a bunch of people who were a couple of years younger than me shouted "junkies!" I thought that was ridiculous. These kids also come to the skatepark to smoke weed and drink while the skateboarders are the most straight edge group there. It's just ridiculous
-4	negative	emotional-health	i hate liars this one boy always lie lie lie and i forgive forgive forgive and he abuse that part about me he lies does something and comes back saying sorry over and over again and i am so stupid to just say its fine . now hes crossed my line of forgiveness and i just feel so angry i feel like punching him until he lays on the ground gasping for air. this is the first time a boy has made me so mad that made me wanna punch him so hard -_-
-1	negative	emotional-health	I hate talking to someone and being completely disregarded as if what I say has no importance. People in my family do that and it makes me feel like no one cares enough to listen to what I'm saying.
-3	negative	emotional-health	I hate when people wrongfully and ignorantly mock mental illness, but i'm not gunna lie I make jokes at my own expense all the time. I have bipolar 1 and adhd and if I didn't joke it would STILL get me angry the whole thing. So although I hate when people are rude towards mental illness, you have to remember not to take it so seriously all the time. Peace (merry christmas to those who celebrate!)
-5	negative	emotional-health	I have a creative personality. I have the honor to have several  patents. I have a  chanagelable personal personal personality. I am just lookig for some to talk with.
-1	negative	emotional-health	I have always been dependent on people but I find being by myself is better cause in the end people won't define me.
-4	negative	emotional-health	I have always been described as responsible and dependable. Through age, I have come to resent this as people often take advantage of those traits. So if you know a responsible, strong type who is always there for others, remember a hug or a thoughtful gesture towards them may make all the difference. As sometimes, us responsible people need to be shown some love too.
-8	negative	emotional-health	I have always been led to believe that truth and justice are the American way, but there are guys who seem very much the opposite, they are oppressive and obsessive, and the only thing I can think they are is immature perhaps. That's my rant on the subject! Sorry guys, no offence was meant, just a query.
-6	negative	emotional-health	I have always dreamed of being big like Arnold. My body type is lean and I have a difficult time gaining or holding onto extra wait. I know what it takes to become big but I can't muster the discipline needed to gain. I am currently eating about 1800 cal. / day and if I want to gain I will need more like 3000 cal. / day. I could try and increase my activity and cause my appetite to increase. what should I do?
-2	negative	emotional-health	I have an electric up bribing and can be some what  to be overwelming  
-8	negative	emotional-health	I have an incurable disease. I have been bedridden almost 2 years. My husband had to quit his job because I just got sicker and sicker. And now his Dad just bought us a house with them building their house out of the huge garage because his Dad and stepmom are both sick too. So now EVERYONE else gets taken care of but me. He comes in the room about 3 times a day. And is on the porch with every other person all day. Then comes in and goes straight to bed sometimes not even acknowledging me 
-6	negative	emotional-health	I have a physical scar on my neck. It's not huge but protrudes slightly. It's slightly pink. I got it when I was put in a coma. They put a thick tube in my neck artery to my heart. I had lung failure after complications from having pneumonia. They burst my lungs.  What do people think of physical scars?
-1	negative	emotional-health	I have a reputation for always wanting to be around people and talk, but I always want to be alone sort of. I think I just like people when I do and abhor them when I don't .
-11	negative	emotional-health	I have a scar, on my face, to the left, right on my cheek bone. It frames my eye, it brings attention. I guess I didn't think it through. My nails dug in, they made that scar and now it's there but that's okay because next time it's on my collar bone, no one saw. This time I thought it through.
-1	negative	emotional-health	I have a song stuck in my head. Usually a couple of random lines going over and over and over. So annoying!
-3	negative	emotional-health	I have a terrible fear of just about everything.  Sometimes, just trying to make plans makes me anxious beyond belief. It's not really social anxiety, because I can hold conversations with people just fine. But new places and new situations freak me out so bad.
-3	negative	emotional-health	I have bad days a lot. Like today. I just wasn't myself. And since I have so many bad day..u don't now what my normal self is anymore.
-6	negative	emotional-health	I have been cutting myself for 2 years now and nobody has noticed. I'm happy about it so nobody will worry but I think to myself. Wow. Nobody cares to look or ask of I am okay. But anyway I cut because I am bullied a lot about my face and because I'm bisexual and because of my thighs (thunder thighs) but if anyone wants to talk about this or anything please message me(:
-1	negative	emotional-health	I have been in EP for a few months, read many stories here, particularly in this experience and other post about had an affair. 
-8	negative	emotional-health	I have been married for 3 months and my husband tells me he knows he is narcissistic then he says but I still love you. I decided to do a lot of research and my husband fits the bill to a T. He doesn't care about anything that has to do with me. If I disagree with him or I dont like any of his hobbies or interest I am crazy for it! All of his sentences start with I, he knows for a "fact" he is better than anybody else at what ever they do. I mean the list goes on and on. I really do not know what to do at this point. We only been married for 3 months and the signs are this obvious. I dont want this being to take up anymore of my time. What should I do HELP!!!
-2	negative	emotional-health	I have been married for ten years an during that time my husband just talks to me less an less. I just need to make a connection with someone who cares I at least exist.
-5	negative	emotional-health	I have been with my husband for 6 years. I knew he smoked marijuana even though I don't use but to give unconditional love I didn't protest it. Six months into our relationship he started using PCP and it has been a fight ever since. He has been in jail several times for his addiction and I am always there waiting. He got out I May and has been clean until a couple weeks ago. Of course he says he is not using but I smell it. I am so tired of crying and being disrespected because when he gets high he gets angry. I don't know what to do at this point. I am on the verge of losing my job but most important my sanity.
-2	negative	emotional-health	I have cried so much that my tears have stopped flowing  I don't know how more I can take any more
-4	negative	emotional-health	I have gained some, well alot, of weight since the weather started getting colder and my depression has gotten alot worse. I am soo depressed that I just can not motivate myself to take care of myself the way I need to to eat right and get some kind of exercise.
-4	negative	emotional-health	I have had a lot of experience in dealing with Spoiled Brats  who many times get in their own way of being lazy, having a bad attitude and many more things. Many times your own self gets in the way and needs guidance to counter. Contact me
-1	negative	emotional-health	I have high self esteem and and proud if who I am! But I can't help but being self conscious sometimes. Every teen is!
-6	negative	emotional-health	I have lost a very close friend, someone online, don't say anything ok. But she was such a good friend I love her so much, she stabbed herself in the lung and died in hospital. I believe although she's biologically dead a soul as beautiful as hers isn't going anywhere just yet.  Love you ellie R.I.P
-2	negative	emotional-health	I have lost two friends. There's no answer though.
-2	negative	emotional-health	I have lots. Mostly on my forearm of which I've chosen to cover with a sleeve of tattoos.
-6	negative	emotional-health	I have lots of scars. Some of them I have forgotten how I got and some of them I have look at every day I can't forget.  They have a purpose. Only the person who bares them knows what they truly  mean. It's between them and God.
-1	negative	emotional-health	I have many scars, but the one scar I *don't* have but wish I did is a saber scar in the tradition of the nobility when they still settled disputes by the duel.    I know this is not "normal"
-4	negative	emotional-health	I have never been able to speak effectively to people.  Every time I manage to make friends by some fluke, they leave me really quickly when they realize I seem to have nothing to offer them.  I don't know what's wrong with me; I always plan what to say before I see someone, but I just can't get it out.  Just seeing people intimidates me, and I don't know what to do about it.  I want to meet people who like the same things as me whom I can talk to, but I can't even talk to anyone.    I'm always alone, and I don't want to be.  
-5	negative	emotional-health	I have not "lost it."  I just don't where it is.  And if I knew where it was, I would go get it back.
-7	negative	emotional-health	I have one and it puts a limit on my life. I can tell people about me and it is never believed. I wish there was someone out there who wouldn't assume I am lying when I tell them about me. Life gets more and more lonely as time goes on. 
-7	negative	emotional-health	I have one friend whom I know for the past 6 months. We clicked and get close pretty fast, hanging out and talking like a close friend. She personally had one bestfriend whom she knew for more than 4 years, which I respect their bestfriend relationship on the first place and I know no one can replace her from my friend's heart. Thank you so much 
-1	negative	emotional-health	I have only been back to work 3 weeks but have already re gained my obsession for work. I love my job but work much more than I need too.  2 days off with my 3 beautiful kids from tomorrow to re gain my work life balance
-2	negative	emotional-health	I have only recently come to the conclusion that I deal with problems by avoiding them.  It'll take a long time but I will not avoid my problems any more. I intend to tackle my life head on from this moment.  I will not live in fear or negativity any longer. 
-1	negative	emotional-health	I have plenty of scrars physically and mentally.
-3	negative	emotional-health	I have read so many stories! Keep your hopes up. I was once the ow, and now I'm his wife! It took almost 4 years, but here we are, 10 years and 6 kids later! Happier than ever!!!(:
-1	negative	emotional-health	..I have seen poverty and ignorance, a poor girl trying to support a family of five , working three jobs, physically exhausted , mentally drain from the thinking of what else she could do.
-15	negative	emotional-health	I have several problems I am trying to work through. It seems that every time I turn around something else is going wrong. I have a great family, two kids and an unbelievable husband. I can't keep myself happy. Lately, I have been attempting to spend money on myself, but as I get to the store feel selfish and spend money on my family. I try to spend "me time" and that's mission impossible. I have tried the meds the doctors give me to "feel" happy, but all they do is make me sleepy or high. I have the love for things, but the things that I love are out of my reach. Am I selfish or crazy to want things I can't get? My husband thinks there is something wrong with him, but I can't expect more from him. How can I make him understand. I have exposed all my secrets to him in efforts to help him understand. I know he loves me, but I need to go back and learn to love myself again before I can become happy. The biggest question is how? 
-3	negative	emotional-health	I have 'Social Anxiety' group on 'whatsapp' mobile phone messaging software. I will add you there.
-1	negative	emotional-health	I have the mentality of a 70 yr old women who hasn't been laid in several years.
-2	negative	emotional-health	I have trust issues and bad situations with family. I would love to love everyone but that just doesn't work for me
-14	negative	emotional-health	I have wasted nearly 20 years with this disgusting human being. He took the best years of my life. I used to be happy go lucky, outgoing and believed that life was good. He is the meanest, cruelest lying manipulative cheating scumbag I have ever known. I found out he was cheating on me when my son was 6 months old outside the grocery store when a co worker of his approached me on the way out of the store with my baby in my arms.  This I endured for years and two more children later and several more affairs, he started to beat me on a regular basis.  I have nothing left in me. I found out I have cancer and have no family to speak of. No support. He's hoping I'll die. 
-8	negative	emotional-health	I hear over and over again, "Your safety comes first." "Your happiness is more important than the hurt feelings that may occur if you." "You should always put yourself first." But I don't agree. There are people in my life that I love so much, that I would suffer for them. At the very least, there are people I care about enough about that I would never want to hurt them.  I guess I just find it sad how egotistical this generation can be, with all of its focus on one's own happiness and well being. Oh well.
-11	negative	emotional-health	I hide how i really feel because if i decided to embrace the pain it will become to real and that will be it i don't know if my body will be able to take on all that pain all at once. People think and say how strong i am but they have no idea how much i hold my grief in, how behind this fake smile i am falling apart. I want to run and run till i end up somewhere where no one knows me and just cry and cry and hope someone will hold out their arms to me and hold me tightly! x
-12	negative	emotional-health	I honestly wish I had a life. I'm 18 almost 19 never had a girlfriend only kissed one girl when I was 8 and haven't gotten anywhere close to going further. I have a few friends but most of them are older than me and I just kind of tag along. I had a few friends online but I lost contact with them. The only thing I've had close to a girlfriend was a girl I met online when I was 14 and me and her talked for awhile, When I turned 18 literally on my birthday she started talking about meeting in person I was all for it but I work at a Walgreen's  I make minimum wage, Barely enough for bills I don't see myself being able to go several states away. I know my life isn't horrible I just feel so depressed because well, I don't really feel like I have any real friends and nothing close to a girlfriend.
-4	negative	emotional-health	I hurt the guy i love the most and i wish i didnt. I let my worrying and anger get the best of me and i really wish i didnt. Im scared to lose him. I honestly wish he knew how terrible i felt inside. Ive never hurt a guy before so with this being my first time doing it i feel devistated. I just wish things could go back to normal. I wish i could prove that im sorry. I just want a second chance to prove i can change. I didnt think what i said could have this kind of effect and im really sorry. I wish he could look deep inside his heart and forgive me for what ive done. I just really want to start over with him. Im so sorry .
-1	negative	emotional-health	I just can't decide whether to add this experience or not 
-9	negative	emotional-health	i just dont care anymore. when i made a mistake, people were harsh on me and if i wasnt up to date or had the latest thing or heard the latest music, i was classified as lame. cuz of the traumatic family visit in july 2012, mentally i degraded. i worried and tried to fix myself up but i was broken inside and people made me feel worse. so i just stopped and said to myself, aint no use of worrying yourself to death so just dont think and worry about it. if a mishap happens, i just wont stress myself over it. i just dont care about messing up or not being appropriate. if i mess up, i mess up. ill fix it when im well and right now in my life, im not well. people expect me to be smart like i was before and im not going to do it. my sister gets mad at me for not thinking about stuff and i dont care. you are not going to make me look like im perfect because im not. i aint perfect so get over it.
-5	negative	emotional-health	I just get so angry so easily, over the dumbiest things. Everyone thinks I'm some nice bubbly girl, but inside I just want to scream at everyone and punch anyone that even looks at me. I have anger management and I wish I didn't.
-1	negative	emotional-health	I just put on a fake smile to mask my pain form everyone, and because i know they don't care i'm dying on the inside 
-7	negative	emotional-health	I just want emotional intimacy with someone.  i want a girl to like me for who i am.   my ex pretended and didn't care about how i felt about her.  its left me with doubt and hate inside of myself.
-1	negative	emotional-health	I just want one person here next to me and I haven't spoken to him in a week , and I can not see him for 6 months and I feel so lonely and not myself advise on how to cope with loneliness ? Xox
-10	negative	emotional-health	I just want someone I could call mine. I don't have to share him with other people. I want someone that will tell me I'm beautiful text me good morning and appreciate what they have. I want someone I can talk to at night when I'm sad or lonely. I just want someone who wants me. I someone to care about me. Is that to much to ask
-1	negative	emotional-health	I just want someone to run their fingers through my hair.
-11	negative	emotional-health	I just want to let you all know before you add me to your circle, that the girl in the picture is not me..she is someone I would love to be.  I'm not blonde, or skinny. I'm brunette and my body type is a bit thicker. I hate the way I look in any picture so I put a girl who was gorgeous and I was jealous of. I'm sorry boys to disappoint, I'm not as beautiful as you thought I'd be
-2	negative	emotional-health	I just watched the movie Seeking a Friend for the End of the World and it's now 3:21am and I have the weirdest feeling ever. I don't know what the emotion is. Sadness, depression, fear, confusion, loneliness, happiness.. I don't know what's going on in my head right now. I need to stop watching movies like that alone and especially at night.
-1	negative	emotional-health	I keep thinking about everything and how it's related to this or to that. Start wondering of extraterrestrial life and if it's possibly already merged with human life. Would love to accept this but it's just a thought.
-3	negative	emotional-health	I kept waking up cuz I was having a dream about my ex who is also my best friend but I can't run to him n tell him my dream because we aren't talking  I have no one to run to. I feel so trapped without him. I have to put on a fake smile around others and pretend like nothing is wrong.
-6	negative	emotional-health	I know christmas is a happy time but last night (Christmas Day) I saw photos of mates with their girlfriends or boyfriends and I just cried myself to sleep that night because know one loves me like that ;-(
-2	negative	emotional-health	I know I'm beautiful inside and out ..I tired out for modleing being plus size and I've been asked to be in play boy but i refused . being beautiful doesn't mean you need to be a nasty women .I am looked at by men as lust but really I'm just a sweet women who's dead knock gorgeous.
-1	negative	emotional-health	I know the feeling.. Hiding the tears and putting on that brave face when really inside your hurting..
-3	negative	emotional-health	I know this may sound stupid, but. I love loving someone. I have to focus my emotions on that someone. Because if I don't I feel like my heart explodes. An I just have so much love that I just hand it out only for it to be throne away. But I guess that's best because its better if I get used to it so in the future it won't hurt anymore.
-2	negative	emotional-health	I know what's making me sad, annoyed, and sometimes happy.  I'm sorry
-4	negative	emotional-health	I like some 'me' time and I think I have overdone it as I have no friends now Moving to a different country probably didn't help Sad 
-9	negative	emotional-health	I like that this is a group. I on another social site used to get laughed at sometimes when I was asked what is my occupation and my response was "I am me and being me is a full time job." I suppose it is a good thing I am me. I know sometimes I got hacked before and fake me hurt people pretending to be me and I had to do damage control when I returned. But other than that, it is really me online. Thankfully most people I meet online know real me from fake me.
-2	negative	emotional-health	I like to say I am "fine".  Yep, I'm just fine! Peachy, even! ;-p
-4	negative	emotional-health	I live in a very warm state with great weather year round.  I am talking about Florida.  I am talking about the summer months in Florida.  They are great for getting into the pool, beach, ocean, or lake water.  I love sunbathing as well tanning my body.
-14	negative	emotional-health	I live with my boyfriend and his brother in there dads house. Sorry if that sounds complicated. It is the most frustrating time ever, i never get listened to. When i want to do something with my boyfriend like go cinema or for a meal he constantly invited his brother, i want some alone time with my bf cause he works all the weekdays and i work everyday apart from friday, so we want to be able to do something on friday nights. I'm too nice to tell him not to invite his brother but his brother is a chauvinist, loud and obnoxious, it's hard to live with him but when he's also coming out on our dates as well it's ridiculous. Can't my boyfriend see i want to be with him alone for an evening. It's upsetting me, i wish i had my own house with him but stuff doesn't always work like that. Feeling so angryi can never talk to him about problems either because he will call me weak, he tells me to try and be emotionless and be strong. I cant do this much longer.
-10	negative	emotional-health	I long for emotional intimacy with my partner. I share everything with him, when a co-worker hits on me, when my ex propositions me out of the blue. I share these things not to get him jelouse or to share with him that I have options, I share these things with him so we can have nothing but an open and honest relationship and so we can be completely emotionally intimate and share everything with each other. He never shares anything with me. 
-2	negative	emotional-health	I lost all my friends as soon as highschool ended. I have no one to talk to anymore. I need someone to be there for me.
-9	negative	emotional-health	I lost my best and closest friend today. No warning or anything, she just left me. Now I don't have anyone I can talk to at all. I have a couple of good friends who I hardly ever get to talk to and that's literally all the friends I have. The rest just forgot me. I'm just in the way. A blight upon everyone. A burden. Maybe it's best for it all to end
-3	negative	emotional-health	I lost my friend Brian on the 30th of December,  I can't believe that I'm never going to see him again.  We built a special friendship. One of those that don't come around often.  I'm going to miss you so much my friend x
-2	negative	emotional-health	I love a good laugh except when it is contagious and I am worried about becoming sick.  I am the King of Comedy. 
-2	negative	emotional-health	I love being Katie! I love being Katie.
-5	negative	emotional-health	I love people (well I love boys..but nobody likes me so nevermind) don't get me wrong. But if I am just not in the mood, or on my period (like really though) or sick or something else, leave me alonebusy. Especially when studying, writing, or something music related.
-1	negative	emotional-health	I love staying up late in fantasies and contemplating life
-2	negative	emotional-health	I love that feeling, it puts a smile on face and sometimes make my whole day better 
-2	negative	emotional-health	I love the contact and sensation you can have without being touched or touching someone.
-3	negative	emotional-health	I love the feeling of the sun on my body and I am not jsut talking about laying on the beach naked. Once summer arrives I like to be on our back deck at 6:00 in the morning, cuo of coffee in hand, as the sun comes up. After working in the yard all day we will sit on the front porch enjoying a glass of wine and watch the sun set. During the warmer months I just can not get enough of the sushine. 
-10	negative	emotional-health	I love the sun's rays hitting my body and warming through to my bones. In the summer, I sunbathe nearly every day. It makes my body a lovely dark honey color. When I have a nice tan, I feel more secure of myself esp when I attend my son's ba I know that sunbathing releases serotonin in the brain( the feel good chemical) and that people, such as myself become addicted to it. This is one reason that tanning beds have become so popular.
-5	negative	emotional-health	I love to eat and gain weight, my goal is to reach at least 350 pounds for this guy I really like. He encourages my weight gain in any way possible. I am doing it for him and for myself. I hope that I am able to do it.
-9	negative	emotional-health	I love to laugh, because it is like meds for me. and a good joke can make me laugh with no doubt. I love almost any kinds of jokes, like blonde jokes (I'm blonde(literally)) and yo mama jokes, and dirty jokes. I love offensive jokes over all. Like jokes about teen moms. Not that i think they should be made fun of but when someone hears a joke talking about them they should find it even more funny because they understand more than anyone else.  Thanks for reading
-4	negative	emotional-health	I love walking and getting attention from males. And it's a ego booster when a guy is with his gf/wife and he still stares.
-12	negative	emotional-health	I'm 19, almost 20 and I met this guy, we tallked, chatted and we fell inlove.it was like we were made for eachother. Then I found out that he's 16. It's not illegal, but it's looked down on and his parents have forbidden us to see or be together.  It hurts, but we have agreed to wait untill he's 18, then were going to date. For now it's just facebook, text and Skype. I'm so gratefully for this! But it hurts being made and forbidden to live someone. The age diffrence is only for years. 
-16	negative	emotional-health	I'm 5'7", Ive always weighed around 115 lbs my whole high school career. However, my senior year I realized how much i like food, and i started eating a lot more. I've gained 12 pounds, and now i weigh 127. My jeans barely fit me so I have to wear leggings and yoga pants all the time. My belly is getting pretty round and noticable. I never thought I would say this, but i actually love how it feels to be curvier. I love how i can fill out my clothes so easily, and i love how my thighs rub together when i walk. I just feel so much sexier and i love eating until i clean my plate  i love how i look being chubby, with long blonde hair and acrylics. my goal is to keep eating too much every day, and hopefully get to 140 sometime this year
-2	negative	emotional-health	I'm a 17 year old, currently studying at college. I don't have it bad, but I just wonder, what is the point anything? I've always been like that since 13. I've never cut myself, I'm terrible with women. I used to get bullied back at school but I feel as If i've become stronger because of this but  now, now i'm depressed Sigh. 
-6	negative	emotional-health	I'm afraid of the darkness inside me. I'm a nice enough guy, I make bad choices like everyone else, but because of how I grew up I know that if I'm pushed far enough, I tend to lash out at everyone. I'm scared of the anger inside.
-2	negative	emotional-health	Im a pretty emotional person i guess..so emotional Intimacy is something I look to develop with friends,loved ones etc..I like relationships with meaning in them strong,deep relationships.
-9	negative	emotional-health	im a spoiled brat and i LUV it!!! i get watever i want, whenever i want. i cry when i dont get my way. my daddys getting my an iphone 5c(pink) i have the most cutest phone ever right now, but the iphone will be MUCH more adorable Im super pretty,rich, and spoiled, and i love my life. people love me so much because there so jealous and want to be me. who wouldnt.?? yay mwah!!!!!! &lt;3
-6	negative	emotional-health	I'm a suburban stay at home mom. BeAutiful home. 3 kids. I have good looks, good health and from the outside people would love my life. But I'm so insecure. My husband has cheated on me 3 times in our 20 year marriage. My mother was an abusive alcoholic so low self worth feels normal. I sure can put up a good show most days. My husband has started seeing a therPist. He finds it easy to lie, and feels he's selfish. It's bend a long 20 years.
-1	negative	emotional-health	I'm crying inside and out!!! :'( :'(
-2	negative	emotional-health	I'm done. I can't take the heart ache anymore. I can't get anyone to see what good I am. People always look me over and move on. I'm not meant to find love. I've tried but nobody even cares. Maybe Im meant to die
-2	negative	emotional-health	I mean it happens!!Maybe its the drinkWHO KNOWS! 
-1	negative	emotional-health	I'm feeling like a bad girl!
-1	negative	emotional-health	I'm feeling tortured right now. And here is a bit why.  In agony
-6	negative	emotional-health	I'm finally accepting who I am and that I am beautiful. Ladies, there are plenty of men out there who love us and our bodies just the way they are. Never settle for anything less.
-7	negative	emotional-health	I'm getting allot better learning when I'm not wanted.  I pay attention to the person behavior. I listen to the way how the person talks to me.  I go a step further, if I find the group is not for me and they not treating me well I will leave.  
-7	negative	emotional-health	I'm going to see her every Wednesday, If it doesn't work out with her my mom said She'll take me to see this Christian guy in CT it's like an hour or more away he does 3 hour sessions 
-2	negative	emotional-health	I'm here in bed with my thoughtsso if you want to talk that would be great too.
-1	negative	emotional-health	I might had been drenched with  a river of mud after a great dirty  tide swept me away I might had been torn into pieces as an unknown whirlwind  tossed me everywhereI might had hit the biggest rock and caused so much injury to my headI might had been blind to wallow in a filthy  death bed. Thank you!
-17	negative	emotional-health	I'm in love with the guy I've been friends with since the 6th grade.he used to be a great friend until he got a girl pregnant and he has to deal with her all the time because of the kid.since we broke up we've been trying to stay friends but he constantly starts fights with me and turns them around to make it sound like I started it,calls me names,tries to start rumors about me..and when I kick him out of my life he comes back with stories of how sorry he is and how much he loves me but is so scared of commitment that he ruins us
-4	negative	emotional-health	I'm in my early 20's and I've never had a girlfriend nor been kissed beforeso yeah, I think I'm pretty ugly
-9	negative	emotional-health	I miss him so much!!! I would do anything to tell him I love him again. We would talk about everything. We would talk all day and night. We would fight a lot but always said we loved each other before we went to bed. I miss when I had to go and u wouldn't stop sending me messages &lt;3 And when we used to fight about who loved each other more .u helped me through everything. I know I wasn't the best but I tried so hard to be. I love u always and forever..I hope you forgive me..I miss you
-1	negative	emotional-health	i miss them so much. why they are so far away?
-4	negative	emotional-health	I miss those Saturdays in spring when I woke up in the arms of my ex girlfriend, and the first thing I saw was her kind smile. And then we stayed in bed for hours cuddling and kissing each other.  God I miss her.
-10	negative	emotional-health	I miss you so much, I tried so hard to get your attention but I cant make you love me. I dropped you a txt message today saying that I will be waiting for you in the cafe. I waited 2 hours but you didnt come. Dont call me again, dont write to me saying how much you need me. Now i know that its all fake. You never truly loved me you just needed someone to talk to when there was noone around. I waited for you for 2 long years. I was so happy when you called me because it was a rare thing. You would disappear and then suddenly appear in my life. But now its over, i dont want to cry over somebody who doesnt deserve me. Goodbye!
-4	negative	emotional-health	I'm never really happy but I manage to be who I am despite how I feel. Life is all about moving on up :D so let's get moving people!
-4	negative	emotional-health	I'm new here I'm Alexa I weigh 200 and I want a feeder to help me triple that :3
-7	negative	emotional-health	I'm not a heavy smoker by any means,  I only really smoke 5 a day at the most, unless I'm particularly anxious and/or stressed. But I'm glad I started, when I light up I just feel the stress and anxiety melt away.  It has definitely helped me get through my anxiety.   and every time I light up, it's a nice little pleasure.
-3	negative	emotional-health	I'm not asking for advice. I just want someone who can listen.
-3	negative	emotional-health	Im not really spoiled, but this isnt about me its about my spoiled brat granddaughter, who is spoiled by me and her mother and we want her to be spoiled brat for her dad,,,, heres the story  shes now 5, When shes with her dad she will get what she wants and if she dont she will throw a tantrum, cuss, scream whatever she has to do to make her dad buy what she wants! also she can and will be rude and bossy at times, and when shes 10 she will get her navel pierced and her dad will take her! she only gets designer brands and her favorite outfit to wear is daisy dukes w a diamond sequence belt, a small tight t shirt, a gold necklace or pearls, her designer watch and her gucci bag and panama jack sunglasses. She gets money whenever she wants it, she also has a nice collection of shoes (uggs, nike, converse) and likes ambercrombie clothes, we also let her wear skimpy bikins and/or thongs she also is allowed to cuss all she wants has no chores and few rules.
-3	negative	emotional-health	I'm not sure is this true, but many times I tend to think this way. Lots have been happened during my short life. And when I compared to myself at some people on my class, I get feeling that I'm too old.
-15	negative	emotional-health	I'm not that average person. I watch how people interact. I learn what makes them smile and what makes them hurt. I read their eyes and I listen to the tones of their voices when I speak.  But as for me. I smile all the time. It hard so hard that when I get home I go to my room and feel vile. Not because I am sad but because I am scared that if someone reads me the way I read them , they will expose me and see the truth. And right now I can't handle the truth of myself . Thank you for listening .
-5	negative	emotional-health	I'm on here to find friends to have a chat about anything. I'm not here for dating etc so please don't ask as I'm not interested. I live with my partner and would never cheat on him as I love him to bits.
-8	negative	emotional-health	Im only 12 years old and yes  faked my age, hers my story it started when my family didnt get me a gift so my dad takes me to gamestop two days later and of course with my luck my dad didnt get it for me.  Then I ran away hoping to freeze to death and have a better life in heaven.  But im not dead or frozen but still no gift this is officialy the worst birthday ever
-2	negative	emotional-health	I'm only 14 which seems pathetic conpared to people here, but my week have been practically filled up by studying,  training,  school and travelling school too home I don't even have much time for myself. People tell me I will be able to cope but I am not doing well. The peer pressure is killing me.
-5	negative	emotional-health	I'm on the verge of losing my mind and running away! I feel like my happiness doesn't matter to anybody. I'm always arguing with my mom about why I'm leaving for college and not going to the local one over here. I'm always tryna do better for myself and people act like me being happy doesn't matter. Like I'm in the world to benefit them in some way. I don't mind helping but i would love to help myself first! I'm just not happy with my life right now. Ready to get out on my own.
-3	negative	emotional-health	I'm reading all of the 'I'm lonely' post and it is just absolutly horrible the pain people have to live through. You need someone to talk to, I'm here. I know I'm a stranger but in life everyone starts as a stranger to each other but that's how relationships grow 
-2	negative	emotional-health	I'm really bad with being affectionate with people, even if they start it. I'm just so scared I'm unwanted.  I feel awful because I'm questioning their actions, but I find it almost impossible to comprehend that anyone could actually care for me. 
-2	negative	emotional-health	Im running away. I am 14 and live an hour south if chicago. If anyone lived in illinois and wants to come. Message me. Im forming a group. I want to go to california.
-1	negative	emotional-health	I'm seventeen, but I have felt like a full adult for probably about the past five years. It's such a strange feeling knowing that others look at me and think that I'm somehow different from them just because a few years may separate us. In the big scheme of things, does it really matter?
-1	negative	emotional-health	I'm so lonely I have nothing to do but lay here on the floor staring at the ceiling..
-1	negative	emotional-health	Im so quiet. Im so quiet, it suprises me, only a little 
-4	negative	emotional-health	Im so tired of my life im tired of all the struggles ups and downs. Everytime i try to be a better person something holds me back this year was suppose to be better than last year
-3	negative	emotional-health	I'm so torn. Did I mention that the gentleman whom I'm getting a drink with works in our building??? Talk about complications!
-2	negative	emotional-health	I'm so unhappy it's not funny I just want this night mare to be over please
-2	negative	emotional-health	I'm starting school tomorrow and I can not even begin to explain to you how nervous I am. I feel like I won't make any friends because I'm starting in the middle of the year after everyone's gotten to know each other Wish me luck please and thank you!!! &lt;3
-6	negative	emotional-health	I'm stressed about going back to college on Monday . I did great my first semester buuuu I went through a lot because i was sooooo stressed . I don't handle stress well ,I start to cry , over think and if I get anything lower than a 85-90 I start to beat my self up about it . And when I do get above a 90 I feel good for a little while but I don't really reward myself or tell myself good job . I think sooooo negative while I'm in school because of stress . I still have a social life but I don't feel like I have time to sleep and I feel like that adds to my stress . My stress levels got soooo bad I had to see a counselors because all my thoughts were suicidal ..and I have no idea why because I know I would never commit suicide . I just want to know ways to relieve stress and just clear my mind from clutter . Negative thoughts is what eats me up the most in college .  Ughhh I don't know what to do ! Help please 
-2	negative	emotional-health	I'm taking myself out of a "relationship" Or at least I'm trying to. It's hard of course, especially since feelings got involved.  *sigh*
-1	negative	emotional-health	I'm tired of beans a monster. I am tired of being able to walk out in 30 below temperatures and be just fine. I am tiredbbeing a creature ice and cold. I just don't feel that froze numbness in my soul anymore. I have tried so incredibly hard to be more than what I am. I can't even be who I was meant to be.
-9	negative	emotional-health	I'm tired of life and everything. I want everything to end. Nothing helps the pain and depression. Even if I cut deeper the pain won't stop. The makeup burns my skin. Everything is painful. Every where I go I feel like I'm stepping on glass. My body on fire. The voices in my head won't stop. I'm tired of living. I have so many ways to die, why can't I just pull the plug right now? Knives, buildings, cars, trains, cliffs, water, rope, bleach, pills, pillows, guns, murder, etc. I want to go that's all. Nobody loves me and nobody wants me. I've written so many suicide notes. "Just do it Ana you're unwanted. Just end your life already." The voices say in my head..
-6	negative	emotional-health	I'm trying to accept that if god sent me a child to guide & love, I have to give up on whats wrong in me , I cant change my horentation, but I have to try to accept it the way it is & if there happy just enjoy it!
-3	negative	emotional-health	I'm very affectionate and caring with people I love. I just wish I had some of that In return. I would love to know that someone loves and cares for me 
-3	negative	emotional-health	Im with my MM again for a 4 day vacay / work. He seems so happy to be with me. And always laughing and smiling.  Its always nice to be with the one you love and who loves you back 
-3	negative	emotional-health	I need 2 things for total happiness; a purpose that makes me want to leap out of bed in the morning, and a lover that makes me want to leap back in at night.
-1	negative	emotional-health	I need my daddy to hold me. I crave him ALL the time
-4	negative	emotional-health	I need to feel desired, I need to know that's I'm something people want. But I'm a very rational person too I don't just want dumb short comment. I want to know why. I love precision.  I want to discover the person I'm talking to by finding what he likes. The turn on, and the turn off.
-1	negative	emotional-health	I need to work on this I say sorry compulsively and then my dad will tell me it stop and I say sorry
-3	negative	emotional-health	I never believed in selling your soul to devil but when my husband got very ill I decided to do everything to save him. The only thing I could think of was selling my soul to devil to get my husband back. Unfortunately, it seems that devil doesn't want my soul. I would do everything to help my husband   Sorry for my spelling, I'm not English.
-4	negative	emotional-health	i never go out i hate it! I'm the say at home boyfriend with 2 babies, they are so arable and  cute and make me happier each day!  my girlfrind works and parties most nights and so drunk, but i'm cool with it.  i bake and cook junkfood all day for myself, i'm so hungry! I luv gaining massive wight for again, and again and it makes me feel amazing!  i shower like every 2 weeks cause i'm lazy, i don't smell. i know i'm fat but  i'm going to do what feels good no matter what!  people already  tease me and  say nasty comments around me, now i will feel good after it instead of crying.i'm a stay at home boyfriend and a total home body, i clean take care of the  babies and  stuff myself with junkfood watching tv!
-2	negative	emotional-health	I never liked being touched.  I really am not fond of physically touching at all.  But if some speaks to me and shares their thoughts and emotions and doesn't leave it up to me to read their mind, I feel loved.  Sharing open hearts with someone is far more intimate than and physical touch.
-15	negative	emotional-health	I never thought I would become suicidal-but I did. I never thought I would self harm-but I did. I never thought I'd suddenly want to run away-but I did. I never thought I would one time starve myself-but I did. I never thought my anxiety and bipolar disorder would take over my life-but they did. Point is, things don't usually go my way. For my entire life I've been holding on to that thin string of hope that's been slowly tearing apart. Behind a smile, I hide the fact that I cry myself to sleep almost every night. I'm a hoarder, unable to let go of anything. I seem to hate people when I'm the real problem. Sometimes I think there's no way to get better, even on my meds. Sometimes I think the best part of my life was when I started the meds and they made me apathetic. But soon enough that apathy wears off but comes back a few times. I just wish I didn't have so many problems with this and the fact that I'm often ignored. Oh well 
-4	negative	emotional-health	In no way am I introverted. However, I find prolonged social interactions quite draining. Spending time alone allows me to centre myself and calm my thoughts. I enjoy doing activities meant for groups or partners alone, such as long drives, walks, movie watching, and exploring new places.  Not feeling the need to be on guard around others or feeling as if I have to entertain them in some way is relieving.
-8	negative	emotional-health	In primary school I decided to mess with my friend so I took his lunch and ran away. He caught up with me and handed while walking backwards to keep up with him then I turned around and hit my head on a window frame. I was like "s**t" but kept walking. Then my friends were like "oooooooh". I felt my head but couldn't feel anything but when i pulled my hand away it was covered in blood. I just said "oh god, oh god". In the end I only needed four stitches but my scar is pretty crazy.
-13	negative	emotional-health	In real life, I'm a fun, outgoing person that's only ever either partying, working or out jogging. They wouldn't connect my experienceproject account with what the person they usually see. What they don't know is what I go home to, and how I spend my free time gardening or jogging alone. Any time I'm not working or partying or doing hobbies, I just lie on my couch and do stupid stuff. I don't think anyone would care if I told them I felt this way, and it'd be unfair if I did. If it wasn't for my humour, I'd have nothing. I am nothing, really, but at least I can entertain people sometimes and give them a goddam bunch of celery I grew. For free! Whoopdie doo.
-4	negative	emotional-health	Inside my own family It's now almost two years since my mum's diagnosis and she's been given the all-clear, but things are still strained within our family.  My dad tries sometimes to be nice to me, but other times he can be so cold that it feels as though I'm no longer being treated as part of the family.  I know I should talk to them about it, but I don't have the courage to.  I don't get upset about it, more angry than anything.  I'm his daughter, and sometimes I feel as though he doesn't even see me.  He hardly ever treats me as his daughter, I feel like I'm just a girl renting a room from him.
-2	negative	emotional-health	In such a good mood today I wonder how long this will last
-2	negative	emotional-health	Internet is my life If you don't have intern you can't be in my life
-5	negative	emotional-health	In the last few months my mood has really improved because of a lovely boy I met he makes me smile and I love him for it
-7	negative	emotional-health	In the physical Universe, the Laws of science orchestrates and choreographs a certain flow to things, a flow that can be predicted and/or manipulated. We see this principle in infamous examples such as Newton's laws of motion: what goes up must come down; push on something, it will push back..I forget the last one. lol . Y'all folks know what I'm talking about, I'm sure that story about the apple falling on Newton's head is planted somewhere in that your minds. 
-4	negative	emotional-health	I observe people while I socialize with them. I know what goes on with them. Whether they're honest with me or not. Whether they're nice or abusive or cannot be trusted. Noah
-7	negative	emotional-health	I often get complimented on my eyes! Everyone says they are so unique and beautiful. However, when I look at them I see them normal. I see them as just eyes. Lol. However, the very first trait I look for in a guy is the eyes and the smiles!
-4	negative	emotional-health	I often sit and wonder about things. Some off the wall things, some outta here things but one thing is for certain I think a lot.  The two things I think about the most is where is my life going and how to improve the quality of life. People speak of happiness is the key to self-improvement. Though in order to obtain happiness is a mindset all on its own. 
-3	negative	emotional-health	I once was told by a friend that I am always smiling and laughing. At the time, all I was doing was crying on the inside.
-16	negative	emotional-health	I only had one child in this life, and I lost control over him a long, long time ago. He is only 22 years old, but he has already made the biggest mess of his life. He was given so many opportunities that other kids his age never got, and has thrown them all away. He has burned every meaningful bridge with a multitude of people that wanted and tried and kept giving him chances to make something of himself. The ones who believed in him and forgave his wrongdoings in hopes that, with their help, they could make a change in his way of thinking and somehow help him straighten out his life. But nothing has helped. He continues to break the hearts of those who love him unconditionally. And he charms his way into the lives of others, only to take advantage of every kindness that is offered him, then he leaves and moves on to his next "victim". And I, am his MOTHER.
-3	negative	emotional-health	I put a lot of stress on my mother. I never appreciate her. I know that she deserves better but I still haven't changed. She's my world but I don't treat her like it. My dad didn't want me around after a while, but she never left me. I'm a horrible person. I don't want to lose her too.
-6	negative	emotional-health	I realized that on the Internet it is so easy to put that little smiley face emoticon and make people think you are the happiest person alive. When in reality you could be crying. I personally know how easy it is. People are not going to read between the lines.     They are going to think its good and not assume that you are curled up in a ball dying inside. That makes me kinda upset, you never really know somebody on the Internet.
-2	negative	emotional-health	I realize now that I have to stop lying to myself and face the truth.  Im done trying to be strong.
-14	negative	emotional-health	I realize that when I thought I feel in love like love first sight was not true . There was a feeling in our eyes that said you ate the one . We got married and after 10 years I can't stand really to be around him maybe sometimes. I have and older friend I really love I talk to him about everything my life and children and just an everyday conversation , I have peace of mine when I'm around him . I'm not annoyed easily, and he is do passive that I know I could live the rest of my life with this man. He is what a husband should be .
-1	negative	emotional-health	I really could use someone to talk to right now. I'm crying and I just found out that I've been played without knowing it for a while now and one of my friends was a completely fake friend. I don't know what to do and I don't think any of you care I mean maybe you will just be a fake friend to me too. But I'm completely broken I mean I don't think it could get much worse. I just don't want to be alive anymore.
-2	negative	emotional-health	I really don't understand how I can have such a good, positive attitude for years, with an amazing outlook on life, and then in five months it all goes to awful stuff. It doesn't make senseI know that God has a plan for me, and that sometimes I have to just put my faith and trust out and let things fall into placebut things are getting really tough. I don't know what the heck I need to do but I know I'm doing something wrong if this is the outcome of it.
-6	negative	emotional-health	I really feel sad because of the tragedies that are going on here in the Philippines, especially the people who were devastated by Typhoon Yolanda, it's so heart breaking. I was very lucky that I wasn't there in the places that were totally washed out during the storm surge. My deepest condolences goes to the people who have lost their loved ones. Hope that all the donations that we've received from different countries goes to the people who needs it the most. I do hope that our Government will do their best. Let's pray for the people who have died and pray that the people may recover fast. God Bless the Philippines!
-5	negative	emotional-health	I recently realized that this is what I want. I want to feel like I belong with someone, not physically but emotionally.
-15	negative	emotional-health	I remember it is Camus who wrote that we need to live life to the point of tears. I always believe that, and it is such a difficult idea to grapple with. It is a daily striving that I fall so far short of. I want to feel that intensity. I want to appreciate life for all it is. It is such a rare things, but the moments do appear. Recently, they have become days, and for a while now I have felt happier than I have in years. I am just thankful that I am able to feel this say about life again. It really is a joy I cannot describe.
-1	negative	emotional-health	I remember the first time i cut myself. It felt right but in reality it was so wrong. A lot of people say that people cut themselves for attention but for some cases that is not what it's about at all. I didn't cut myself on my wrists, I cut myself on my stomach and on my thighs. Depression made me do it. I didn't know what to do and I didn't know how to handle it.
-7	negative	emotional-health	I sat outside. It took a lot of energy just to force myself out of the house. I let the suns rays sink into me. I tried so hard to say no to those negative thoughts in my head. They have so much control. I just pondered my life and wondered why I'm even passionate for. The answer is nothing. No matter what you do someone else is better. No one appreciates anyone's uniqueness because everyone compares everyone. I hate living in this god awful earth.
-5	negative	emotional-health	I self taught myself screamo because I think metal (no matter what type) is beautiful music with such strong meaning. And I am so aggressive and have no control of my anger so I use this method to let it out. And it helps instead of being physically violent I could either try to write a song, or scream asking alexandria.
-1	negative	emotional-health	I sent my partner these words two days ago: 
-2	negative	emotional-health	I smoke alot of cigarettes. About to put on my coat and go out for one actually. I'm 17 and almost independent. Hate the fact that I can't buy my own cigs yet even though I work full time and can obviously afford my nicotine and thc habits. I also really hate the fact that i can't smoke indoors because my moms against the smell. I respect her though I love my mom.
-1	negative	emotional-health	I spend 16 Hours in front of my laptop per day. I do all sort of stuff with my laptop : school, work, entertainment and socialize (EP!). I don't really spend time in real world because people around me is terrible and fake. That's why I do not have a GF or a trust-able friend. On here I can do whatever without being judge or afraid of people knowing too much. I just love my laptop so much. It's my GF. lol.
-15	negative	emotional-health	I started college a year and a half ago, and I was having a hard time. I was lonely and had very few friends. One of my guy friends helped me through this and I ended up enjoying it more. When I was still lonely though, I thought maybe it would be a good idea to apply to another school. Later on, I also started develop feelings for my friend. To get to the point, I got into a better school then the one I was in, so I am going to go there. And yeahhe has feelings for me too. If I stayed at my current school, we'd be dating. But since I'm not, we're scared it won't work out. My new school is an hour and a half away from my old one, and I can't drive. Do you think it's best what I did? What should I do? I wish I could be in two places at once, for me and for him, but I chose me this time and I'm afraid I will regret it. 
-7	negative	emotional-health	i still feel like a kid even though everyone around me tells me im grown.  i get it. im grown and nobody is going to take care of me except myself. i get it! just shut up! i dont need it reminded to me a million times.  i feel like a child cuz of the things i like. i still like pokemon, wrestling, nintendo ds and cartoon shows. i know when to act my age. i like to do it at home. home is where you be all the kid you want. what happens at home, stays at home.
-5	negative	emotional-health	I still struggle with it but I am still here. It was hard and it still is especially since marriage is something I have always wanted. It's heart breaking to go back and look at all the useless wedding stuff sitting in my closet but only time heals. 
-4	negative	emotional-health	I suffer from depression. I want to be free. I want to go. I want life to be fair, i want to be given something and not have it ripped away. 
-1	negative	emotional-health	I take it ridiculously personal when someone doesn't think I'm attractive. I'll start to question myself and my looks even more than I did before. And when a cute guy doesn't pay attention to me, probably simply because I'm not his type, I begin to think the worst; I think he thinks I'm ugly, fat, ratchet, unintelligent, mean, not girlfriend material, etc. it's horrible.  I already have the issues of the feeling of being inadequate when it comes to my looks, and I often feel like my personality is dry. But when others think that.it's like a confirmation of sortseven when they might not even actually think thatif I feel like they think negatively about me at all, I feel horrible.
-1	negative	emotional-health	It always happens to me in Christmas 
-13	negative	emotional-health	It amazes me how close we got. I never felt so comfortable just being me. We talk about everything! Nothing is ever embarrassing! We are free to communicate! I may not be "in love" with you, but I do love you. I care about how you are, and I care about things that are bothering you.  I love who you are, and what you do to me! My dearest friend, you're special to me and I thank you for coming into my life. I will NEVER forget you! Ly
-1	negative	emotional-health	It becomes hard after a while, to actually be myself. After so many years of pretendingpretending to be happy, pretending to be okay, it's become routine. Even at times when it's okay for me to let the mask fall, I keep it up. I don't think I even remember who I really am anymore.
-3	negative	emotional-health	It been a few months since I wrote a story in this section. Despite I still feel left out I starting to learn how to accept it.  I find other ways to live my life.  I do lots of nature trips and try to connect with nature and animals so I don't need to feel completely left out.  Yes  I know it not the same as people but I find nature and animals are allot more interesting than people 
-1	negative	emotional-health	It doesn't bother me one bit to b ignored.  Hey dammit I'm venting here!!!!!
-16	negative	emotional-health	It doesn't matter how much you tell me im not, I will still think I am. I like to give a hundred percent at everything. Rather it be something easy like watching a television series. Or having a conversation. I always tell myself that, oh well you could have done better, you should have done this, that, then, now, next week! Its so stressful but I cant make my mind stop. Its like perfection takes over and tells me im worth nothing and all I am is a bother. Who would want to talk to me? Who wants to be with someone as ugly and dumb as me? Why do I constantly think these things? So if I bother you tell, it may hurt me a bit. But I'll survive. I try not to be a bother but its like no matter who I am around, Im bound to be one.
-4	negative	emotional-health	I tell ya what! Feels like I've gone back on my word here many times. One minute I want to end it, next I promise not to initiate textsthen I say I'm okay with just seeing each other when he can. Sorry to whoever is reading thisi think I'm rambling at this point. I just don't have anyone to talk toand I need to express my fears and feelings. I love this man so much it is making me crazy! I don't know what to do anymore but cry until it doesn't hurt anymore.
-5	negative	emotional-health	I tend to stop what I'm doing and start to monologue about how the world is just a dirt ball or how humans are eventually going to kill ourselves.I believe that one day I will understand the puporse of life if I keep this up.
-2	negative	emotional-health	I think everyone does at some point in there life,
-2	negative	emotional-health	I think honesty is very important. In person its completely understandable to keep things to yourself, but online its all anonymous anyway, so why not share your feelings and thoughts freely? No one will ever know its you!
-3	negative	emotional-health	I think if you're funny, smart, interesting, can keep a conversation going, and outgoing and open about things. It doesn't matter afar you look like!
-1	negative	emotional-health	I think I'm fat and I weight 100 lbs. I'm short but society is definitely at fault here
-5	negative	emotional-health	I think Indian women don't express what they feel easily.Men have difficulty in this.They want to show they are strong .Women are also conditioned to appear strong for the sake of the family.Even public displays of emotions are discouraged.This is good but sometimes bad as people of other countries find it difficult to understand us.Hopefully,things are changing now.
-3	negative	emotional-health	I think it's one of my biggest problems really. I don't let things go, and they just build. I sometimes feel like a balloon that someone keeps filling with air. It just sits inside of me no way out. Maybe, I'm waiting to break. Let it all go. I struggle to talk about my feelings, and most of the time I refuse to cry or even be upset in front of people. 
-4	negative	emotional-health	I think that almost everyone who knows me thinks I'm always happy, calm and not very sentimental or easily moved. I'd even been told by a few friends that I have a boyish personality hah. They can't be more wrong 
-13	negative	emotional-health	I think the hardest part of living each day is not knowing a true answer to why my son passed away. He was always such a healthy baby at each appt, always moving around. We enjoyed seeing him on 3D/4D and got an amazing video of him. Living each and every day with the thought that my body failed me, is killing me. I truly believe that they let me go to long and my son was to big for my body. He weighed in at a big 10lbs 2 oz and 22in long. Each day I went for an appt in the last 4 weeks they would say next week they will induce you and than just kept putting it off. I blame the doctors a lot for this and that I didn't get to see the same doctor each week. We have been waiting over 4 months now for autopsy results that were done on 6/11/13 when he passed. We just feel there must not be anything to find and that they will probably come back unconvulsive. 
-5	negative	emotional-health	I think this is something everybody seeks.For him/herself or for others precious to them. I hope everyone eventually finds his/her harmony so that the world can existence peacefully.
-1	negative	emotional-health	I think very deeply--so deep that you can't even fathom the depth. But don't even bother, 'cause reallyI just don't have the interest.
-1	negative	emotional-health	I thought I believed in love but now, I'm not sure if I do anymore.
-4	negative	emotional-health	It may be the social media sites that are making me feel this way, but every day I feel like someone cast a permanent invisibility charm on me. Anytime I go out by myself, particularly if it is to my college campus or to the doctor or the dentist, I don't feel invisible, everyone greets me and is always friendly. This is the only time this is the case though. If I go anywhere with my parents, to large gatherings and most predominantly online, boom, on goes the invisibility.  I wish something would change soon, I do everything I can to keep in touch with friends and to share my life with them and the end result is the same, like I'm invisible. Thanks for listening to me ramble.
-19	negative	emotional-health	I took back all of those pieces that other people had taken from me.   Some of them had been gone so long that I didn't  even recognize them myself.  But I took them back anyway. As I put them back,  I carefully looked at each one and decided that each experience,  although bad,  had shaped me into the woman I am today.   Surprisingly none of the pieces cut me.  The sharp edges had become blunt over time.   I put them all back together and the whole person was there in front of me.   I looked for flaws and saw only beauty.  I looked for weakness and saw only strength.  The true reflection that looked back at me was a strong woman who has been through a lot.   But I'm not battered. . I'm beautiful.   I'm not damaged I'm desirable. None of those bad experiences define me They shaped me into this wonderfully unique person that I am.   I am all that I am. 
-7	negative	emotional-health	I totally over think things way too much. My latest over thinking was way far out there, I was so freaking far off, but kept my busy mind to itself till I had all the facts So yea totally over thought this situation but I'm glad I didn't make a fool out of myself by texting a bunch of crub before I heard from him and had him explain a bit
-2	negative	emotional-health	I try so hard to get you off my mind but nothing seems to work ;(
-1	negative	emotional-health	I try to smile and laugh as much as I can but most of the time I fail bigtime.
-3	negative	emotional-health	It's 02:58 am and I just can't sleep!! Too much whirring around in my head. Anxiety is taking hold tonight :-/
-7	negative	emotional-health	It's as if I've accessed a different reality. My environment feels painted, my thoughts about the world are very clustered. If I think about the question of the after-life's existence, my mind goes berserk in imagining non existence and eternity. My mind is both blank and full. I feel sick to my stomach and last night I freaked out cause one eye saw everything darker than the other eye. But before I noticed it was one eye, the whole room was a Maroonish color and my vision was that of a liquid. I feel like I'm outside of my body yet in control at the same time. I'm the lightest I've been in a long while but I can't even eat a McDouble without the urge to throw up. I'm getting worse.
-7	negative	emotional-health	It's been a month and a half since it ended and he hasn't spoken to me since. He hasn't unfriended me on Facebook but I don't know if we will ever go back to being friends. I don't know if I'll ever see him again. I cried so much at first and then I felt like I was finally healing. It still hurts when I remember him. I can't forget the last words he said to me. I keep tearing up recently but I know it's time for me to move on because it's over. I feel so pathetic sometimes.
-4	negative	emotional-health	It's Christmas today, and as usual, I'm spending it alone. My mom is overseas with her boyfriend, and my lover is busy with his family.  Thank you for reading. 
-2	negative	emotional-health	It's crazy how fast things can change.  And 3 days ago that all changed.
-3	negative	emotional-health	It seems that I've made so many mistakes lately. Looking back, I really don't know what was going through my head at the time. I want to become a better person. I sometimes struggle with being judgmental, and I'm too impulsive for my own good. I just want to learn how to change.
-2	negative	emotional-health	Its hard for me to make friends and talk to people. When i do, i make a full of myself. I cant help it and I'm not perfect. Sorry.
-1	negative	emotional-health	It's just burdening somehow. I never let anyone knows my true self, i keep everything for my own. And i dont think anyone can stand with me for a long time, because im not good enough, and im afraid to disappoint others. I always pretend to look cheerful and confident in front of people, in fact i always feel inferior and vulnerable.  I sometimes think that i'd better live alone than having the chance to disappoint my partner. Please help me anyone. I really want to change. Am i helpless already?
-5	negative	emotional-health	It's like, last year my best friend made three or four other best friends and that was the worst time in my entire life because I felt like I was all alone and I had nobody to talk to. I would often feel lonely and try to miss school just so I wouldn't have to sit alone at lunch.  However all then people have moved on now and I have my best friend back. I love her and everything but I felt used. I never told her that though because I didn't want to hurt her or lose her like she hurt me. I miss her.
-1	negative	emotional-health	It's New year, but My life is going to be like the same. I feel like the whole world is not for me. I don't know whether I don't want to be with others or others do. It seems like everything in this world is not created for me. I feel like I want to die unless I have someone who cares for me and I care. I just got blank all the time :'(
-4	negative	emotional-health	It's not that hard to say "I'm sorry" and its a lot easier just to mean it.  Apologizing is something that alot of people have a hard time doing, but I don't see why. If you're apologizing for whatever it is, you're admitting to being wrong and trying to do the right thing. What's so bad about doing the right thing nowadays?
-2	negative	emotional-health	It somehow makes me feel a little bit better in spite. When you smile even though you're sad it does make things better. And when you smile even through it all it doesn't seem that bad. 
-9	negative	emotional-health	It's pretty hard, viewing the world in a pessimistic way. I couldn't be more annoyed when I see that I've done something so well that it couldn't be better no matter how hard I tried, because no matter what I do it's imperfect. I've tried so hard to make myself presentable in society but can never be happy with how my life flows. It should be this way, or that way, and when I make it this or that way I still see room for improvement. This is normal, but the problem is that I see the need to act upon it. I fear this will be the death of me.
-7	negative	emotional-health	Its really hard. I still miss her so much. I am the one who broke up, but still, its not like I wanted to. I knew it was best. But I didn't want to  A lot of people I know are already married and thats so weird. In my surrounding people marry when they are like 22. Weird to see that others can find someone they can me happy with. A lot of girls where into me but I was never statisfied. Its hard to imagine finding someone better then my ex, but I had no choice
-10	negative	emotional-health	It's really weird. I'm actually in special education because I over think way too much. I think about every possible idea and/ or outcome that could come out from me. I over think so much that it distracts me or gets me bored so I fall asleep most of the time to stop thinking. That's why they assigned a help teacher to always just help me narrow down my next possible answer and just go on with the rest of my class. But because of this, I became a bit of a loner. Oh well. The friends I have are patient with me and are great.
-2	negative	emotional-health	It's sad because I see girls everyday that get treated better than me because they're prettier 
-1	negative	emotional-health	Its sad to say that i can only trust 2 people with my life not including my family but my circle of friends
-11	negative	emotional-health	Its so hard for me, to watch things end. A good book or movie, the last piece of pizza or chocolate. Those endings are expected, but still sad. Its heavy. It aches. It feels like it will last Forever. It makes you look deep inside yourself at what you usually try to avoid seeing. It changes your whole life, mostly in terrible ways. It scars you and taints your future relationships, assuming youll be strong enough someday to embark on another. And at first, all you see is that end. It looks an awful lot like a dead end.
-2	negative	emotional-health	It's so much easier to say. And I might be quite selective about who to tell some things..
-6	negative	emotional-health	It's strange.  I love my job.  I really am doing pretty well to be honest.  I should be happy.  But as I get older, I discover that something is missing.  Something that I can not explain or even put my finger on.    There are times, I get up and just want to go back to bed and stay there.   I have friends.  Even one or two who I would call good friends.  But I can't tell any of them how I feel.  I don't even think they know in most cases that there is something eating away at me.   They can't see the pain I go thru everyday.    There are times, when I just wish I did not have to deal with the world anymore.   
-11	negative	emotional-health	It's the holidays & I've been receiving a lot of envelopes with $ & gift cards this week. Today a resident puts an envelope on my desk and I say "Oooh~! Thank you~~~!" Because I'm on autopilot. She says that the envelope is not hers, that it was put in the wrong mailbox. Ahaha!Ha!
-2	negative	emotional-health	Its the little things in life that bring me happiness. A hug, kiss, friendship, family, hand holding, making a difference in someones life, a smile from a complete stranger, laughing, childhood memories, a personal letter, listening to your favorite song, dancing, and most importantly love. These are a few of the little things that make me grateful I'm alive. 
-5	negative	emotional-health	It sucks to stuck in my own emotional battles. I know some people who just go on life without much of an emotion, nothing disturb they from getting what they want. how do they do that!?!?! I doubt surpressing feelings are healthy. but still, it's amazing what one can achieve without emotional disturbance. psycologist blames that on how i was raised, my parents mostly. so what now, my children are going to blame me for whatever they don't like about themselves? We can never achieve perfect in this world.
-2	negative	emotional-health	It sure would be nice to not be judged and loved for the person you are. But some people aren't like that unfortunately
-2	negative	emotional-health	It's very easy to say I'm okay, as it is for a lot of others. But it's a sad thing to say you're ok and then feel the sinking in your chest/stomach telling you that you aren't. Sometimes I try and tell, but people just don't get it! I've found that thinking positively about situations can make life brighter and happier.
-6	negative	emotional-health	It took me some time to embark this ..   Realisation point today : It is  hard trying to be happy everyday all dayand It is definitely not easy to carry on once you have been hurt, broken ,beaten down or betrayed :/ but somehow we manage to pull through though   Worry  does not empty tomorrow of its sorrow, instead it empties today of its strength Live your life the way you want to .. You dont need standards to defy you ..Be who you are and say what you feel, because those who mind don't matter, and those who matter don't mind. )
-2	negative	emotional-health	It was hard but I stopped I think about going back to it everyday but I don't I'm better than that
-13	negative	emotional-health	I used to be extremely Anti-social. But as I got older I needed a job and working forced me into socializing with people. After a while I was comfortable with talking to people if it was unavoidable and I absolutely needed to. I called those forced interactions. And now here I am at 25 pretty social, but socially awkward if that makes sense. I over analyze things and situations and have trust issues. I'm always observing people and trying to figure out their intentions. There are days where I can keep a conversation going and come off normal. Then there are days where I just stumble upon words and don't know what to say. It wouldn't even matter if it were someone I already knew and spoke to often. It happens. Sometimes I feel it's best if I leave things unsaid or prefer to say nothing. 
-5	negative	emotional-health	I usually like to have time alone when I'm upset or I feel like I want to cry. I also like being alone after a long day of being hovered over or being in big crowds. Its beneficial if I just need time to think or if I'm trying to do homework. Especially if my parents are arguing or my mom is on the phone. Sometimes I get shy while playing my wii soo I'll go upstairs to my bedroom and play Just Dance. And when my parents leave me home alone I swear I throw mini parties where the dog and I dance, and we make cookies or something.I don't know Im weird 
-6	negative	emotional-health	I've always been quirky, different from anyone else. I don't exactly follow the mainstream like everyone else. My mom is who forced me to try and conform, though I never really did.  Maybe someday someone can just understand. Love me for me, it's something I'm still learning to do. 
-3	negative	emotional-health	I've always been the one that people come to for advice or to confide in. It was just like that, and i got used to it, even if my own issues weren't heard. But lately, i've become distant to those that come to me. When they come to me, I'll listen and answer and try to comfort them but I'm bored. I don't really care anymore. I'm done with hearing their problems, and not having mine addressed. But the nice person in me can't just leave these people alone.  I made a vow to myself that wouldn't cry.
-6	negative	emotional-health	I've always tried to smile or pretend like nothing's wrong when everything is actually falling apart. Today I've heard the most hypocritical conversation ever. Its a personal thing that I'm not going to mention but it truly hurt me so much that it just broke my heart to hear every word. No one has noticed how broken I am inside but its better that no one knows my real problem, why should they bother anyway? 
-3	negative	emotional-health	I've been a beach girl my whole life. I'm pale and burn so easy but I love the sun and warmth of it. I like to lay in the sand and just soak up vitamin D.
-22	negative	emotional-health	I've been broken a time or two myself.  I think most of us have. Sometimes it's just a little chip around the edge and sometimes a crack to the very core that makes you stop and wonder if you can even be fixed again. And if you are fixed are you going to put together as someone quite different from the person you once were. Oh yes, I have a place in my heart for broken people. I understand you and I know that sometimes its pretty easy to mend the cracks but other times it seems like those cracks might just turn into craters and tear you apart. Oh we put on our face and don't often let the world see the cracks but when we stop and think about it for a minute we know how deep our own cracks are. Sometimes we even think that we are less because of the damage we have sustained. Yes, I have a place in my heart for broken people because I know you have lived. I know that you are more for every little chip, crack, crevice and crater. They make you more beautiful, never less.
-2	negative	emotional-health	I've been focusing on problems a lot lately. Sometimes it's reverse progress. If a baby deer spent all its time freaking out because it couldn't walk it'd never learn to run. It's been fun dwelling in my mind. Other things too. It was nice to get a chance to relax. It had been a very long time, and I'm not sure I ever really knew how till now. Time to pick up and go though. Return to the flow.
-1	negative	emotional-health	I've been hurt too much in the past. Maybe one day, I'll fully open up.
-2	negative	emotional-health	I've been in my room for almost a week now, I have been avoiding people and I don't really want to talk to my friends or family. I haven't been in school for quite a while.  I just want to be in my room and watch movies all day long. I don't know if I'm scared of something or someone but I feel like there is a reason for all this which I don't know of.
-4	negative	emotional-health	I've been living in Michigan my whole life! Been living pretty much in the same town and house too!! I was able to be on my own for a few years but moved back with my parents to finish school! I'm going crazy here! I feel so trapped yet so scared to venture out. I am going to graduate school soon and feel like maybe I should try to move out of state but the fear of losing my whole entire support system is terrifying me!!!
-1	negative	emotional-health	I've been living my life the same way since sixth grade. I never leave my house, and when I do, I always make sure to cover as much as possible. I'm terrified that people will look at me, and I can just hear their thoughts. Because of that, I never leave. I just sit behind my computer (the one place I feel most comfortable) and forget my life in music and anime and the sims. I don't have the money to go out and do things, and even if I did, I have no one to go with. I would never be able to go alone. I can't handle it.
-5	negative	emotional-health	I've been looking at our Christmas tree decorations and remembering my wife. Each one brings back different memories over the years from when we were kids to our first married Christmas and before our kids were born. Then the ones when the kids were with us and growing up. And the last few years she had with us. I can't seem to find space for any more new ones since then. Maybe I should get a bigger tree now.
-3	negative	emotional-health	I've been married for 14 yrs, in the beginning, my husband was very kind and very loving, 14 yrs later, it's all gone. I have 3 children and since having the 3rd child, things have gone on a down hill spiral. I almost feel like he resents the 3rd child as he doesn't seem to want to spend much time with him. Everyday I wake and wish for love. All I get is a sickly feeling. He makes me feel sick.
-2	negative	emotional-health	I've been married for 17 years. I've always had doubts that he truly cared for me. Lately he comes home late and hardly talks. He's a gambler and a drinker, but quite a kind person, but I don't feel like I can go on with the uncertainty of this marriage. I stay away at night ( on bad days) and curse the fact that I've wasted my best years on him. He has nothing, I feel a great loyalty to stay with him. Anyone else feeling in the same boat?
-1	negative	emotional-health	I've been sitting here staring at the clock on the wall 
-1	negative	emotional-health	I've been talking to a guy for nearly a month.  I'm tired of trying..
-2	negative	emotional-health	I've been used for emotional support and disregarded as someone who never needs to be loved back. I want to be able to talk to someone who believes in me and supports me because i need someone other than myself to do it. 
-2	negative	emotional-health	I've been waiting for my dealer for 3 days now. Please, will him to call me.
-5	negative	emotional-health	I've been wearing glasses since I was 14 years old. I've been scared of wearing contact lenses (even today), so putting them right on my eyes was not an option. I like wearing glasses though, it helps me see blurry things clearly, obviously.
-11	negative	emotional-health	I've feared becoming my father. I've feared becoming my mother. I've feared passing down what I feared was inherited. Maybe it was just situations passed down. I believe negatives can yield positives. I've felt strength grow from weakness. I've still got some instinctive aversions and discomforts. I've been on the path to soothing them. I'd like to be more than a mere product of circumstances.
-5	negative	emotional-health	I've got one on my knee from a bad spill when I was a kid (probably should have gotten stitches, looking back). One on my left eyebrow from accidentally ripping out a piercing years ago. And a bunch from various puppies I've raised and my bunny who likes to dig her claws into your flesh and then launch herself off of you. But I still love her 
-2	negative	emotional-health	I've had boyfriends before, two. But the odd thing was, I never actually loved them. They loved me but I didn't love them back. Boyfriends, yes. In love, no. How weird. I don't know what's wrong with me 
-10	negative	emotional-health	I've had it pretty much my whole life. Bullied in school from when zi was in kindergarten because I was a quiet kid and it just got worse from there. I look at other people and think they are so much better than me in every way. I always seem to get criticized by someone about something which really doesn't help. I didn't talk for two years from when i was five until I was seven. Then I went to see a psychologist and that helped get me started back talking again but still I feel inferior. I act different and can talk to people now but I still have those feelings. 
-5	negative	emotional-health	I've heard I'm brutally honest on various occasions, but I respect what is. And sometimes what is happens to be ugly. Facing up to it is my style.
-1	negative	emotional-health	I've lost 10kg over the last year and I feel great and am the happiest I've been in a long time
-1	negative	emotional-health	Ive lost so many people i love so fast. I feel like my lifeis crashing down around me 
-3	negative	emotional-health	I've never found myself to be an interesting person to other people. I always found myself to be boring when compared to other people.
-9	negative	emotional-health	I've triedI really have. But what would you have done if u felt like the walls were closing in on you???Yeah, I panicked and the first thing i might have reached for was the razor, but so what???..Who gives a rat's head about what i do??? I guess I'm once again on my own..
-3	negative	emotional-health	I've tried several times, earlier this night. But I just wrote a poem, hopefully it helps.  Opening your eyes and hoping.
-1	negative	emotional-health	I walk down this old road 
-1	negative	emotional-health	i wanna go to college and start a new start life. ive been looking for schools/universities that offers free education/scholarships. is it impossible? 
-3	negative	emotional-health	I want a real type of emotional intimacy. One that will last a long time. I want the desire to be satisfied.
-3	negative	emotional-health	I want deal whit Satan am have a quality soul to sell if price is right1 
-7	negative	emotional-health	I want my husband and i to have no problems sharing our online activity, mine is completely open to him and his os all locked up, he doesn't bother to read my things but i wouldn't mind him too, he does NOT want me to read his, sighs, this is killing me'
-1	negative	emotional-health	I want someone to gently run their fingertips along my body, give me butterflies and kiss me gently.
-9	negative	emotional-health	I want to die but I want to survive, I feel like I'm in a dark room sitting in the corner and theirs barley any light I'm swallowing myself up whole and I'm scared the thought of suicide comes more often though out the day. Everything won't stop it's all passing by me when I go somewhere it feels like I'm not even there like my body isn't mine anymore and all I can do is scream from the inside. somebody please help me before it gets worse.
-1	negative	emotional-health	I want to have a relationship and to be loved
-5	negative	emotional-health	I want to leave where I am. I am miserable here and want a new start. I would like to gather a group of people who also wish to leave. I think this will make it easier and better to run away. If you wish to join me please message me or comment.
-4	negative	emotional-health	 I want to promise to all my friends, I promise I promise
-8	negative	emotional-health	I want to see 2 people laying in there own pool of blood i could careless what happens to me my mind will be at peace once i know there gone I'm tired of everything at the moment and cant think straight all i see is them dead there blood everywhere and the warm blood dripping down my hand and a knife
-13	negative	emotional-health	I was doing some housework today and paused to look around. I saw the bare walls still looking freshly painted from this summer. Unopened paint cans next to the fridge. Paintbrushes, rollers, paint trays.Many of the rooms empty. One with my boxes still packed. I will need to resort them again. And I thought about how many houses I have lived in. How I tried to make each of them happy homes. Outsiders would often comment on how beautiful they were. I could fool them. But I knew none of them were really homes. My choice of a mate was what was the problem. My divorcing him was the best thing to do for me. Now I can walk away from this house. I can leave it for someone else to love. And my gardens too. I can build a new home from scratch filled with love and with peace. And if you ever come to visit me, you will feel what a real home feels like. My friends: do not waste any more time. I am Free. Thank you for your time. 
-8	negative	emotional-health	I was going for a walk. And there is a middle school around the corner from my house. Some lady came up to me and asked, "what time did you guys get out of school?" I politely told her that I didn't go there. But, they have minimum days on Wednesdays. I'll be 22 next month for crying out loud. Lucky for her I attended that middle school so I know the schedule.
-7	negative	emotional-health	I was googling dissatifaction in marriage when I stumbled on this site, I am so glad I did cuz I need to empty my heart rite now.. I've been married for 2yrs now and  and I want out.. Am tired and emotionally drained,am tired of trying so hard to please someone who never cares abt my feelings. He dictates my life, every thing I do, say or want he dictates. I jus have so many tins I want to do with my life.. And I feel lik a prisoner
-9	negative	emotional-health	I was in a bad position in my life when I came across this book, and while others thought it a horrible act to try to rid ones self of love. I thought it would be a great blessing if you don't love you don't get hurt right. every decision in the book was made purely on fats by those who the cure worked on Anyways I just thought it was a cool Utopia. Even though I'll admit when you're in love there is no greater feeling in the world :D 
-7	negative	emotional-health	I was just putting makeup on and looked at the scar I have on my chin. There's nothing special about it. It's small. But as I was "hiding" it with makeup I thought to myself why hide this? I like to look at my scars and remember what happened. Some bring me a lot of pain, some bring me bad childhood memories but this one in particular makes me think of a good time I had with friends. It was great until I fell and busted my face! Lol
-4	negative	emotional-health	I was kind too many times and i got nothing but frustration . Enough with the times of silence , bring the darkness , let me swim in that ocean till the dark waters get into my lungs and take my life away .
-9	negative	emotional-health	I was never this way until I got into a serious relationship. When I was single, I loved sleeping alone in "my" bed. I had a queen sized bed and it was more than enough space for me. I loved sleeping in the middle and had more than enough room to stretch out. I hated when he would stay over because we didn't fit in the bed comfortably. He's much taller than me and would hoard the covers and leave me squished in a little corner! Now that we have a house together and we have "our" own king sized bed I can't sleep without him! I've grown comfortable laying next to him each night. I usually can't sleep if he's not next to me. Oh the irony.
-8	negative	emotional-health	I wasn't quite sure what group I would join (thanks to EP forcing users to pick a group when posting a story), but I decided to join "I am constantly torn between logic and emotion" This is a case in which our President's heart was in the right place, but how he went about formulating the law was completely wrong. 
-11	negative	emotional-health	I was on the street with my classmate and with hes mother. We talked about school when a car crashed in the tree and hit my classmates mother. She and the driver died too. We stoped talking and just watched the place few minutes. Aftrr that I put my hand ony classmate  and I sad "Shes gone" when my  classmate started to cry. After that my classmate changes completely and become herselfs oposite side(agressive, fighter, drug dealer , drunk ). That moment changes my life to and from that yime I live myself on my own house to save myself from the same thing.
-5	negative	emotional-health	I watch people. I know what goes on with them while they talk to me. Whether they're honest with me or is full of lies. I watch their behavior towards me. Whether they're abusive or sociable.  Noah
-3	negative	emotional-health	I wear bikini tops and 2in' short shorts all the time. I live right at the equator so its always hot. I love going outside in my bikini and standing outside with a nice warm breeze blowing through every crevice of my body and the sun kissing my skin. Ah it feels almost as good as my boyfriend sliding his hands from my chest all the way down my belly and legs (that feels the best)!
-4	negative	emotional-health	I weigh 106 pounds but I still feel fat! and I've been bulimic before I just want to get to like at least 98 pounds, can someone help me, I eat healthy and stay fit so it won't be unhealthy.. does anyone have any tips or something that might help?
-6	negative	emotional-health	I weighed 226 lbs then I started exersing. Now I weigh 199 lbs. I haven't lost any weight in a couple months and the happinesss of the weight loss has worn off. I want to lose weight.
-1	negative	emotional-health	I went to a brazilian coffee shop ( usual spot), got large coffee black no sugar and 3 bread rolls, walked to a chill pot, read a book, smoked a cig or 2. just chilled. with winter coming guess i can invest in some snow gear and do it up. 
-5	negative	emotional-health	I wish everybody was happy.. I see people getting bullied and getting hurt and hurting themselves all the time ill look in class and see girls even boys with cuts on them selves when they catch me looking thy quickly pull there sleeves down. I even seen people cry due to pain, that others have started. People can be cruel boy I wish the world was full of sunshine and happy people..
-5	negative	emotional-health	I wish I could be free from the shackles of my mind. That is after all where freedom starts. It's an idea, it's a state of mind and then it goes through execution. Sometimes, however, the idea is the hardest part.
-2	negative	emotional-health	I wish I could go to my friend's birthday event. This is gonna be the 5th one I've missed.
-1	negative	emotional-health	I wish I could not care. There is a thousand pounds of weight on my shoulders. Pressure to do well in school, pressure in society to look nice, act nice, fit in. Of course I understand the concept of working hard equates to success but I'm so tired of it.  I wish I could be me, but we are all merely actors on a stage right?
-6	negative	emotional-health	I wish I was someone else, I wish I was someone that people want to be around, someone that people invited to parties, stayed up with all night talking about nothing with and someone people like even love. Does anyone on EP live in Buffalo New York?
-2	negative	emotional-health	I wish that just for once I would get invited to a New Year's Eve party. This is my first year of being 18 and I have no friends and so no one to invite me to a party. I am Cinderella. Minus the fairy godmother. So, even Cinders has it better than me.
-4	negative	emotional-health	I wonder if anyone knows the real me. Underneath the make-up, smiles, pretty dresses, and gorgeous hair, lies a lonely girl who would always feel incomplete and not good enough. A girl who's tired of keeping up with the pressure, expectations and rules. Why can't people seem to appreciate me, just me. Not what I look like, not what I wear, not how I walk, not the model,  not the girl who wins beauty pageant. Just me, Monique.
-3	negative	emotional-health	I wonder if emotions are like web strands we can connect to the world through.
-2	negative	emotional-health	I wonder if he's thinking about me!?
-2	negative	emotional-health	I wonder what my mom and dad would say, if I told them that I cry each day. It's hard enough to feel so far away
-8	negative	emotional-health	I work at at luxury condos, at the lobby and I received packages & mail. The most handsome young man, who makes me nervous, lives here occasionally at his parents place (they travel a lot and I don't like his dad). He brings young college grads over often, too, all smexy!  I swear to god, this guy turns me into mush and its not fair! Fortunately I can laugh at my own expense.
-4	negative	emotional-health	I would love more people from age 18-22 to just share our days with,keep each other's spirits uplifted. When upset to have someone to text too and give advice and comfort. Please no annoying or creepy people just those who want to be there for each other&lt;3
-1	negative	emotional-health	i would love to sell my soul to devil to eliminate my lover's suffering .
-4	negative	emotional-health	I write a lot of Rap music and Poetry. so most of the time im in deep thought with my feeling to get some serious and feel in my music. and sometimes it makes my expressions sad. and ive been told I look sad a lot . the power of music huh? 
-2	negative	emotional-health	I wrote this to my husband and wonder how many people can relate 
-3	negative	emotional-health	Just broke up with my 1 year boyfriend and father of my son Everything in my life goes wrong. My brother ran away last night and he should be back soon cuz he always runs away and comes back the next one of two days. My baby is sick with the flu and he is miserble. 
-1	negative	emotional-health	just got dumped, for something that happened over a year ago im hurting
-2	negative	emotional-health	Just unhappy. Can't really do much and pretty much stuck here with a man I thought I once love. Is it really love? I don't know anymore. I feel like I am struggling inside and don't know what I want. Hate the feeling!
-5	negative	emotional-health	Kept happening so I quit loving people. I love my family but that's about it. I'm pretty neutral about everyone else. I don't hate you or wish any bad on you. I care if ur upset or sad but I'm not gonna jump off a cliff for you. I'll bend over backwards in some cases but I'm not cliff diving for any ole person who needs me
-7	negative	emotional-health	Lack of confidence is something that I have never experienced, but lately I have noticed that my confidence has started to deteriorate as result of my Depression.  I am determined not to let this get the better of me as I am aware how hard it is to get your confidence and self esteem back.
-7	negative	emotional-health	Last night I got the best birthday gift I could ask for, to talk to you. Even though you weren't here with me, which is the only thing that could of made my day better, it was still amazing just to hear you're voice. Just to hear you play that song&lt;3 it stole my heart, even though it doesn't make sense it made me the happiest girl ever. There's just that thing about you I can't seem to get you off my mind. I'm so great full to be you're friend, and thank you for making this one of the best birthdays yet!&lt;3
-3	negative	emotional-health	Last night I told my married man that I was moving on after 5 years of an emotional roller coaster I am facing reality.
-3	negative	emotional-health	Lately I've been watching myself staring into space and its hard to hear anyone when I'm drifting. I just go dead faced and I'm gone. Maybe it's just cause I don't want to BE here I hate my reality
-8	negative	emotional-health	Lately I've felt like needing a girlfriend. A real girlfriend that I can be real with. I have been single for a year and a half now. My last one was a wreck so I've basically enjoyed the single life since then. Then being single was the thing for me, I enjoyed every one moment of it from having no drama to a string of fwbs. But now I can't have an emotional attachment. I find it so hard to be intimate. Maybe it is still repressed from my last relationship, or I cannot find a single one I can be my real self and be intimate with. When I mean intimate, I want to be able to connect as how I used to. Share emotions, feelings, and know that someone is there for me as much as I am there for them.  - just my thoughts
-2	negative	emotional-health	Lately, ive had a spike in irritability. If i hear someone say my name i snap.
-2	negative	emotional-health	Let's share some secrets. I just finish having an amazing conversation about secrets. Inbox me and ask me first.
-1	negative	emotional-health	Life gives you so much and takes all away from you at once. My life did that to me. I hate my life and i hate that fact that I am still living. Please kill me someone. 
-1	negative	emotional-health	Life is lonely!  Only have one true friend and hubby is never there for me emotionally
-18	negative	emotional-health	Life's hard! I feel like there's no hope! 2013 has ruined my life. I was in foster care every since I was 6. I just emancipated this year after I graduated high school. The foster system care system gave me an apartment. I had to find a job ( which I have one) then I went to college ( now  attending college) all of this happening in 2 months was crazy and overwhelming. Then this year I ended up Fallin in love with a guy who ended up hitting me and keeping me away behind close doors. Then I was blessed enough to save 3000 dollars in my bank account and then the next day I find out someone went into my account and withdrawed 2000 and found out it was my Bestfriend. Everything is bad luck this year. I'm tired of waking up feelin lonely. While everyone's asleep I walk a tight rope. Questioning my existence! I need some support. I ran to psychics to help me, I ran to pastors, I'm stuck and I find comfort in thinking of suicide. Which is so sad to get to that point. What's the use??
-15	negative	emotional-health	Life: What is it about? Is it about finding true happiness? Is it about living every moment like it is your last one? Is it about making other people happy? Is it about showing your skills to everyone? To stand out from the crowd? I'd say it is about finding out what life is about: it's one of those things you can't understand until you no longer have it. What do you think?
-1	negative	emotional-health	Like, I feel like crying in a good way. During my small group at church, we were singing on how God loves us and it made me feel like crying but in a good way.
-3	negative	emotional-health	listening to this song on a summer evening. you can spy the waves of heat traveling up the road like a mirage. the warmth is exhausting. you clothes your eyes and let your past flow back into your veins.  
-14	negative	emotional-health	loving someone that you already know that he's not the right one. it's been for year now. and it's going to be an end soon. He punched me on my arm because i dropped his phone down when we were fight. i was shocked and still. he said sorry to me and said he didn't meant to hurt me. we are fight all the time. he called me names. he made me feel worthless. i have low-self esteem since i've  met him. i love him too much to give up. i know i shouldn't be with him. he's my boyfriend and also my only one friend. i don't want to lose him. we shouldn't have been together. we should have be just friend. i already loved him. it's hard to step back to be friends. 
-1	negative	emotional-health	MAJORITY of the time I don't know why we are all full of ourselves XD but by not talking sometimes we could solve many issues problem is some people never shut up.
-2	negative	emotional-health	Man I just hate them they r so annoying and if u lie to me I will figure it out and block u right away sorry but that is the truth
-2	negative	emotional-health	Men should be tough, I agree. I show hardly any emotion, because I'm just so sure that people wouldn't understand the passionate maddness that goes on in my head. They don't get the motivation for  all that I do, all that I am. I just wish someone would try to, just try to figure me out, maybe we could have something in common, even just the slightest thing. I feel like I have so much to share, but I'm so unable to connect with anyone.
-2	negative	emotional-health	mistakes are worth making because it teaches you right from wrong.
-7	negative	emotional-health	Most days I sob to myself but I think it was last year that I threw one of my lego figures up against the wall and it broke straight away . I initially told myself that I didn't care, I didn't care about anything but now I am sadder.  I used to love playing with my legos especially bionicles, and go on to the lego website and play all the bionicle games and they also used to have a little tv show thing that was cool. 
-1	negative	emotional-health	"mother f-cker!" But there bad words. But he says there not if your a adult. But why are they not bad words for grown ups but they are bad words for me? 
-3	negative	emotional-health	Moving away from negative family members and choosing to never speak to some again will probably have been the best decision I've even been a part of making. I'd rather live meager and happy than be objectified to mental abuse any longer.
-2	negative	emotional-health	Music from the 70's reminds me of my older siblings. For me that was a simpler time in life because I was so young.
-5	negative	emotional-health	My 2 year old daughter wanted to talk to her Daddy, so I decided to FaceTime him. She was so excited & I was in awe of how giggly & sweet she was.  I feel so over this cycle. I just want to be happy and I just wish he could be happy with me. We're already separated by states And have no plans to move there anytime soon. Not sure what the next step should be. Should I stop talking to him for awhile?
-1	negative	emotional-health	My addiction. It takes time.
-5	negative	emotional-health	My addiction to emotional intimacy has became an emotional dependancy on my other half, without me even seeing it -  and as such has crippled my marriage. My need for emotional intimacy suffocated him and he has, in a defensive action, pushed me further away . I am now aiming to learn to find emotional intimacy from other sources - not from another person, but reduce my reliance on it and sober myself from it.
-2	negative	emotional-health	My airman leaves in July for basic and all my friends say we have so much time but I feel like the time is just slipping through my fingers. He's only gone for 5ish months but we're together 24/7. What do I do with my life?! He's seriously my only friend.
-4	negative	emotional-health	My angel I pray your life will be light and warmth. If some fate should ever lead you to read this, know I loved you with no reservations. I would rather have suffered eternally than do anything that would cause you the least pain. Knowing my ignorance hurt you is an eternal punishment. I hope one day you will forgive me even though I will never forgive myself.
-2	negative	emotional-health	My bed is comforting, but I'm laying here and not sleeping. Any ideas???
-9	negative	emotional-health	my boyfriend and the love of my life passed away 5 months ago from a drug overdose .. i do no do drugs so i didnt understand nd i did what i could to help him .. but my best wasnt good enough .. i tried for a year before he finally gave up!! i have no answers once he passed his family wanted nothing to do with me .. i have a few of his things but not much ..

-1	negative	emotional-health	my boyfriend has bin in jail since oct 11th 2012, and still has 10 months to go  I miss him so much
-4	negative	emotional-health	My boyfriend struggles with his body image, as he always feels over weight. He is the guy that was looked over for years, and I still get comments all the time that he is "unattractive" or that I'm "too pretty for him". But I honestly don't care. His personality is possibly the most beautiful one I know, and to mehe is the single most attractive person I've seen
-1	negative	emotional-health	My boyfriend touches me but I don't feel the spark on his hands when he does.
-8	negative	emotional-health	My brother is dating a controlling girlfriend and I hate her so much, she talks to much crap about people, she told me she lost respect for me because I played a song, she told me I was worthless, and she says I need to grow up because I tell my grandma that my brother and her are always on top of each other in his bed. I'm so sick of her..
-8	negative	emotional-health	My country India is unique .There are about 20 different languages spoken by its people.You get up on a train and you can hear different languages being spoken by the passengers.Hindi is the language widely understood.Most understand English as well.Most Indians are Hindus though there are Christians and Muslims as well.3 other religions -Buddhism ,Jainism and Sikhism were also found in India. Still we  we are united in our diversity.
-6	negative	emotional-health	my dad is a chronic alcoholic and i have all these memories of him from when i was little and i just want him back to that. i miss the way he used to be because whatever it is now, it isnt my dad. i really miss him and i hate having to watch him deteriorate. he can hardly remember things that happend  when i was little and it really makes me sad when i see him.
-9	negative	emotional-health	My dad passed away 11 years ago when I was only 9 years old.  At weird times when I'm either thinking about him or stressed out I'll find pennies in the strangest places.  This morning on the way to take my GRE test for graduate school, I said some prayers and asked my dad to help me have confidence in myself during the test. At the testing center, they give you a locker to put your belongings in. Upon opening mine, I found a penny heads up right in the door of the locker.  Unlike my mother, I have always been skeptical about "pennies from heaven". But this morning after finding my penny from my dad, I found confidence in myself for my test just as I asked him and confidence in the pennies I find truly being from heaven.    
-1	negative	emotional-health	My dark lord I will do anything for knowledge ultimate  power and strength and wealth . You know when I say I will do anything I will!
-5	negative	emotional-health	My ex cheated on me but I couldn't prove it , now he's with someone who I used to be friendly with and I have proof that he has slept with someone else on her , do I reveal this info ???
-6	negative	emotional-health	My eyes are mainly blue, but the closer they get to the pupil they turn green and then hazel around the pupil. One of my friends only noticed the other day and he got in real close and was holding my eye lid open so he could examine it!!
-12	negative	emotional-health	My family has notice a change in me. My father has asked me what's on my mind. My dad also said that a family friend sees I'm not as bubbly as I used to be. My ex-mother-in-law asked me why I'm not smiling as much as I used too. My children never complain about me, but they also said I'm not joking as much as I used too.  Just ready for a change! A good one too!!!!!
-4	negative	emotional-health	My father passed away last April. He was opening a restaurant with my uncle, fast food pizzeria/ lebanese cuisine.  Sort of how my dad was.. taking care of his brothers and us, and then when he passed away, 2 of his brothers stole the business from us. Fkn scumbags. It's a shame we're too nice to take them to court since we do not want them to go to prison 
-1	negative	emotional-health	My first answer would probably be my name.  
-1	negative	emotional-health	my friend are leaving me for others.I can't stop it. They just care more about them than me. I'm not worth fighting for, I guess I don't mean as much, I guess I'm not enough.
-9	negative	emotional-health	My friend is dying. Im resorting to an unhealthy need. I can't cry and it hurts so bad. I want pain, right now. And that scares me. I worked hard to overcome this, but I can't cope. She's so young and this isn't fair. I met her in chemo two years ago. I survived. Why can't she? Why did God choose me and not her. I'm so angry right now. I'm angry at God, I'm angry at her doctors and her family. This isn't fair.
-4	negative	emotional-health	My friend just passed away  2 months ago  & I just think about him all the time but I know he's in a better place
-25	negative	emotional-health	My friend tried killing himself one time and never got help. He is lucky to be alive. Well yesterday i am in second hour and he texts me; "now" so i respond "what" he said "i need you, come to your car" once i asked if he was ok he said no. And i was freaking out and asked to go to the nurse and then i just left and went to my car and apparently he took more pills and tried again before school. I had a feeling something was up when i picked him up for school. But i ditched and talked to him and he wouldn't fully open up with me. And i was shaking and crying i just want to help him. He knows I'm the only one he can relate to, yet he still only wanted to talk to his cousin which is actually kind of rude to him. But i hate when i ask if he is ok and he just acts like nothing happened. He tried to kill himself, that's not nothing. I wish i could help him.
-3	negative	emotional-health	My girlfriend means so much to me. But I think I'm starting to like my ex again. I'm not sure though. It's so confusing
-8	negative	emotional-health	My head hurts , at my new job everything is different  My husband loves someone else  Had and argument with my mom ..I had to move in with after my divorce I had no where else to go let's just say she is so selfish I think I rather just live in the streets . I'm tired today lonely upset . Will things ever get better  I've never been those low in my life ..
-4	negative	emotional-health	My heart and mind are constantly at war with each other. I always try to do the right thing, but sometimes I just don't know what that is. My mind tells me it's crazy, it's wrong, it's impossible My heart completely disagrees. It makes them both ache. 
-1	negative	emotional-health	My heart can never be mended This is how and why I hurt everyday. I miss you my love my best friend. The only man I will ever love I love you always 
-5	negative	emotional-health	My "husband" and I have been together for about three years now. We met when I was young, about 16. Throughout the years, he has come and gone until about three years ago he and I finally settled into a true, fully committed relationship. I miss him. I miss who I used to be too. I will write more later once I get the courage. 
-6	negative	emotional-health	My husband is addicted to opiates.  He is taking suboxone now. But ran out early.  I caught him in yet another lie yesterday.  He went and got a temp fix. Although he swears he threw it out the window because he realized how wrong it was. I don't believe a word out of his mouth.  So sad
-23	negative	emotional-health	My husband is addicted to pain pills. He sometimes will take up to 20 or more a day. He sometimes snorts them or eats them crushed to get in his system faster. It started out for pain but i think he likes the high more than needed for pain. He is spending up around 500.00 or more a month on getting more than his prescripton. He doesnt work and now is so depressed that he doesnt do anything but lay around. Im not sure if the depression is from all the pills or that not having enough. I have helped him get more for so long out of guilt. I didnt want him to be in pain plus he makes me believe he hates me or its my fault. Finally i took all the money we have left and hid it. He just went thru 90 in 4 days and now has none. I refuse to get him more this time. He says he is just going to go thru the withdrawls until he can get more. I want to call his doc but im afraid of what will happen. This is way out of control.
-1	negative	emotional-health	My husband is a workaholic and has to travel more than 50% of the time. We are in a new state, I have no friends, job or interests to keep me distracted. I just want him home so we can begin a life together. Anyone out there with similar situation?
-5	negative	emotional-health	My husband won't admit he has a girlfriend, but he also doesn't delete their text messages or facebook messages.  When I tried to confront him he just shook his head and walked away.  Now he is telling her he is going to divorce me but still acting like he's here for good.  I don't know whether he is stringing her along or still making up his mind or whether I should just file for divorce.
-4	negative	emotional-health	My husband works overnights this weekend my kids are with their father I'm completely alone and my love is home with his wife.  Weekend contact is rare but I'm always hopefulalmost always disappointed too.  
-5	negative	emotional-health	My legs are too scrawny. My stomach is too round. I want the perfect body. I have thought about trying the anorexic route. Then I read that I am sick and rude for thinking it's something I can choose. But it works for Alyssa. She is so skinny. I want to be like her.
-6	negative	emotional-health	My life has been one big great joke a dance that's walked a song that's spoke I laugh so hard i almost choke when I think about myself!!
-8	negative	emotional-health	My life is falling apart, so apart that I m afraid if I can pull it back together. I dont know what is going on with me, but I feel like everything that I hold for ,everything that I wished for is falling apart. I feel sad; I feel the sadness penetrating its way through me. I do not know what future holds for me and I dont even know if I have a future. I feel lonely, alone in a world where there is no one, but myself. Im standing alone in the darkness. I want to cry so hard, and loud, but I cant. I have to pretend that everything is fine, put up a smile, make everyone laugh so they won't see the pain I'm hiding. So fake. There is so much pain, pain everywhere. How can I run away from it? It is following me like my shadow
-1	negative	emotional-health	My mind is so overwhelmed with thoughts the good, the bad, the ugly but at the same time my heart beats out my chest with excitement. What is real, what is just said. It's going to be a long night and it's already tomorrow 
-6	negative	emotional-health	My Mom always told me that I'll be pretty if I'm skinny.  Once I reached 127 pounds (the lowest I've ever been) I believed what my Mom said is true. That's when my high school crush noticed me. We were in AP psych and he actually talked to me.
-1	negative	emotional-health	My mom and I are not normal. We often have conversations like strangers.  
-8	negative	emotional-health	My mother just passed away on Sept. 24, 2013.  The whole day I was surrounded by butterflies.  The next day I was going about my day taking care of the funeral plans and I had seen so many pennies every where I was.  I have always known about "Pennies from Heaven".  To me by seeing and picking up all these pennies my mother was telling me that she has made it to heaven.  Thank you Mom, I miss u a lot.
-3	negative	emotional-health	My mother passed away when I was 3 from a drug overdose and I never even knew her. I've been told so many story's I don't know what to do think anymore I know live with my nana and not a day goes past without me thinking about it 
-7	negative	emotional-health	MY NAME IS KAREN , AND I WAS SITTING IN THE WAITING ROOM FOR MY FIRST APPOINTMENT WITH A NEW DENTIST. I NOTICED HIS DDS DIPLOMA ON THE WALL, WHICH BORE HIS FULL NAME. SUDDENLY, I REMEMBERED A TALL, HANDSOME, DARK-HAIRED BOY WITH THE SAME NAME HAD BEEN IN MY HIGH SCHOOL CLASS SOME 50-ODD YEARS AGO. COULD HE BE THE SAME GUY THAT I HAD A SECRET CRUSH ON, WAY BACK THEN? "WHAT DID YOU TEACH???"
-1	negative	emotional-health	My opinion is often disregarded because of my age. Most people assume i have nothing significant to say.
-1	negative	emotional-health	My parents are great at these.  Not referring to anyone on here, just a couple of people I know in real life!
-2	negative	emotional-health	My partner stood me up on New Years Eve. He told me that he didn't come because of my daughter who is 9 and has behavioural problems. I asked him to leave today and now he is gone. I'm feeling a mixture of relief and sadness. 
-4	negative	emotional-health	My posts are a clear example on how my mind goes on and on. I have so many misconceptions. It blows.
-6	negative	emotional-health	My right thigh, roughly about 3 inches long. A surgery when I was very young, I have only vague memories of it but don't know what it was for. It still itches or burns on occasion, but I'm proud of it. I've come a long way from the little kid I was back then.
-1	negative	emotional-health	My sister died 2 years ago, she was my best friend. I would give anything for one more conversation with her. 
-2	negative	emotional-health	My sister is cold as ice. I have had to defend myself in court, go to therapy, and work my way up from a pit of depression to the happy person I deserve to be. I am strong, but this has been so very hard.
-1	negative	emotional-health	My SOCIATAL MASK is nothing more than the shearist silk veil. Both online &in pearson.
-3	negative	emotional-health	My spirit feels dead and my soul feels destroyed. No biggie, just thought I'd let everyone know 
-9	negative	emotional-health	My story? HA. Where do I start? Im 16 years old. A sibling of mine recently passed from cancer, My grandpa died from it, And my grandma is currently dying from cancer also. My parents divorced but yet still fight as much as they did when they were married. My dad lives in town but doesnt bother to talk to me. I suffer from severe anxiety and depression..I just lost my best friend and Im in love with a guy that is headed in the wrong path. But to others Im just a simple girl that always has a smile on her face. If only people really knew, ya know?
-1	negative	emotional-health	My trust issues are definitely increasing now. Geez..
-12	negative	emotional-health	My uncle, who I loved and respected tremendously, who I love and revere to this day, how was a sweet man, lay on his death bed when I called on the phone.  His children, my cousins, were there and answered the phone.  They let me talk to my uncle and all I could say was how someone had taken the tulips from my yard.  He said, its not a good time.  That's the last I heard from my uncle.  I replay it all the time. Wishing I could have just told him I loved him and told him goodbye.
-3	negative	emotional-health	Never been a fan of the sun but I must reckon that sometimes a bit of sunlight can feel good, especially during the hours of the day when the sun is already retreating. I like very much this hours and the sunlight in this moments.
-3	negative	emotional-health	No matter how good I look to other people I'm never good enough for him I just want him to be madly attracted to me like he once was
-4	negative	emotional-health	No matter what ever i do i always get treated like dirt. Im nice to people, i have helped people through their problems and what do i get, absolutely nothing. No one ever seems to care about me and i dont know why i ever cared about them. I am sick and tired of it >
-2	negative	emotional-health	NO ONE is gunna treat me right, like ever   
-3	negative	emotional-health	No one is perfect. If they think they are they're lying to their self.
-6	negative	emotional-health	No one knows how much I try to keep a smile on my face and even being happy. Truth is, I've cut, thought about suicide, and I've tried running away a couple times. What do I do wrong ? I mean I've tried to be good, but no one cares.
-1	negative	emotional-health	No one wants to know what goes on inside my head :p i always over think everything, I really do need to rest my mind. 
-6	negative	emotional-health	Now I would never try to kill myself, but I've gotten to the point in which I am just existing not living. If a doctor told me I had cancer or some other disease, I probably would wither away and die. I'm not sure why this feeling has come over me. I feel as if there's nothing left for me. I have nothing to fight for seemingly.  I see nothing in my future but more of the same. I don't know if this is depression but I feel there is no meaning to my life. 
-8	negative	emotional-health	Often, I think I am stronger than I used to be. Well, I know I am. However, I still take things too personally. Even at work I tear up if I think the doctor is being snippy with me, or my patient doesn't care for my advice or feedback.  I was reviewed at work the other day and was concerned I hadn't filled one paper out properly. My review was very good, yet I still see what I struggle in as glaring.
-3	negative	emotional-health	Okay ..I'm tryna figure out why my body feels like my cycle is coming on and it just went off ?? My cooch hurts!!
-12	negative	emotional-health	Okay, it all started a few months ago when I met this person through one of my friends. At the start we really hit it off and it all was going great, they even said that they liked me, a few weeks in this person and I were constantly messaging and all was good until they started getting really controlling and they kept saying for me to do such and such a thing or they would be odd with me.. I foolishly did whatever they asked of me and let them use me.. But I liked them a lot.. I've never felt to weak in all my life Why do I still like them ? Even though they were horrible to me
-3	negative	emotional-health	Ok, so here's my one weakness. I've have never shared this because I just can't bare it. I can't bare talk about it or think about it and I've just used escapism to get by in life. It kills me. I'm putting this up here because I've finally ask for help with my insecurity using a donating site, has anyone used one of these before? I just can't take it, please goto the page for further info www(dot)gofundme(dot)com/6a2ak0
-11	negative	emotional-health	Ok so here's my story. At age 15 I went into high school being top of my class both academics and sports . I wanted to be a pro soccer player and was in training for that. December 2009 a little later, I fainted and fell off a stool hitting my head on the marble floor knocking me out for a few seconds. I suffered from a concussion and I've been having headaches ever since. They're constant . Never have ever gone away. I had to quit regular school, start home school and work through the pain everyday . Math is the worst It hurts my head more than anything. Somehow I made it and learned to cope and graduated high school. Now in college classes are so hard I think I might explode . These headaches have made my life aweful I can't go on vacations, I'm sensitive to noise and lights , and no one understands. I've tried dozens of medicines and none of them have helped. Actually most have made it worse. I want to be a nurse that's my goal in life now but I just don't know how ill get there.
-6	negative	emotional-health	Ok. So I haven't seen one since I've been back 'home' I guess you'd call it. But I've been seeing them regularly for a few years now. ript for Xanax is usually the best part of the visit too!
-7	negative	emotional-health	Ok so I really liked this guy and he said he "loved" me and I actually BELIEVED it and we did some pretty nasty things to me and I let him do it to me at the time and now that I think about it I'm just like ewwwwww that's gross but ya so I just advise u not to love anybody just for the good stuff make It to each other as well!!
-4	negative	emotional-health	Ok so my mom thinks my boyfriend has a bad influence on me because I'm swearing and stuff. He never does that stuff and is very supportive on me. I'm just really upset about my life and I hate myself. I am having family issues and can't seem to trust my family. I just want someone to talk to that can listen to my problems and won't judge me.
-11	negative	emotional-health	Ok so this is why I think I'm struggling to cope at the moment and having a quarter life crisis. I'm lucky in some ways, I've got a bachelors  of engineering in mechanical engineering and I've got a graduate job. I'm getting paid, putting money into a pension, got dental insurance, a boyfriend of 5 years, its all very grown up.  I'm just trying to dig deep and get through this grad scheme so I can stop moving around so much and settle. Thats the problem, I'm in a place for 6 months then zoom! I'm off somewhere else. I want to just settle down, find some like minded people to be mates with. That's all I want.
-1	negative	emotional-health	Omg , Can someone please send me some money to pay off my grandmothers cancer bill 
-1	negative	emotional-health	Omg ! I couldn't sleep last night .. I keep thunking about old crap :P .. And whatnot >_> .. Not sleeping for so many hours made me kinda dizzy .. I nearly fainted .. .&lt; .. Lord please grant me a good nights sleep , Amen~
-3	negative	emotional-health	On a late-morning walk, following my footsteps, I turned up to look at the sky. My gaze rested on a cluster of clouds high up and further away. Just then, the clouds were illuminated from the other side by blazing white sunlight. I saw the silver lining of the clouds form in the most magnificent way! 
-10	negative	emotional-health	Once the temperature reaches & passes 30 degrees Celcius, that is when I start whinging & complaining. It begins to feel humid, which makes me uncomfortable. Not even swimming helps as, when I get out of the pool, I'm hot again. Then when night comes & the temperature is still above 30, it makes it hard for me to fall asleep as there is no air conditioning where I live & a fan can only do so much thhen to blow the warm air around the room.
-3	negative	emotional-health	Once upon a time a girl and a boy fell in love and began to spend all their time together. Until the boy broke up with the girl. They worked through it and then got back together. Until the second time. . . and oh wait the third time. Last but not least, in the first new month of 2014, the boy broke up with the girl for a fourth time. I don't really know how to work myself through this. I have been trying to surround myself with friends, but the heartache still feels very fresh and I feel constantly sick. I'm scared of the future and I don't know how I am going to ever feel like myself again. I just feel beaten up and broken down. . . I thought I was in love but now I just feel like I've been an oblivious idiot and I don't want to deal with this pain anymore. I've never felt more alone. 
-12	negative	emotional-health	One common thing I did most of my life is not telling people what I feel when something effects me.  Well I spoke to someone last night that told me I need to do this. They told me the first person I need to do this with as they know this person been effecting me.  Today, this person called me. I did decided right away to be honest with this person.   Though this person still willing to help me, I'm not taking help from this person that keeps hurting me again and again and breaking promises.   So I said what I needed to say and now I can move on.  I'm going to do this with more people know letting them know what I feel. 
-2	negative	emotional-health	one might argue we're not that valuable.  so you have to ask yourself: where does your control begin and end ? do you even have any kind of control ?
-7	negative	emotional-health	One minute I was planning to go to school next minute I'm done. Then I have to wait for work. Got the job but won't start till the 9th. Seems like it's taking forever. So I've been spending a bit too much time here. So these thoughts are what keeps me up. I'll just take some Benadryl to help me sleep. Once every three nights only though.
-7	negative	emotional-health	On the computer, it's a lot different, but in real life speaking to another person is so difficult that I just don't even try, really. I'll never initiate a conversation with someone I feel is a stranger. They talk first or it's just going to be awkward silence from there on. And even when they talk, I just don't say much. I have a tendency to stumble over my words and not have the ability to clearly think as I speak and I'm one of those blushers that has their whole face light up like a Christmas light so I just stare at the table the entire time. I've been ridiculed by my family on occasion for my fairly anti-social behavior. I get the feeling they just tease and don't seriously mean it, but for them to laugh at me for my fears hurts. I'm afraid of messing up a conversation, for being too afraid to carry it out, for being worried they'll reject me for a lot of reasons.
-1	negative	emotional-health	Our song Walk on solid ground
-4	negative	emotional-health	Out of all of the people that have messaged me on here, only ONE was decent and nice! Everyone else is like, "Let me have your bras, etc. Come on! That's not how you get a woman. Geez. I'm not your baby, darling, or sweetheart. Or they hit on me. -_- Just proves what the world is like. I wish it wasn't this way.
-2	negative	emotional-health	Pain lets me know im still alive .
-1	negative	emotional-health	Pain: Sorrow: Regret: Anguish: grip my heart pulling me towards a jagged cliff.  I turn and see the 
-2	negative	emotional-health	Pants,A Long Sleeve Shirt And  A Fake Smile To Finish It Off.  ( Sorry I Haven't Been Posting)
-6	negative	emotional-health	People always ask me if I'm okay and I put on a smile and say I am even when I'm having thoughts of killing myself. And sometimes I even want to say I'm not okay but it always comes out "I'm okay"
-1	negative	emotional-health	People are just as happy as they make up their minds to be.  Abraham Lincoln
-8	negative	emotional-health	People dont notice me. well at least they didn't. I usually knew what was going on in my classes I could hear there conversations. People didnt notice me before even teachers they often forgot about me. But now I can't do it annoy more I don't know what I did I want to be my old ninja self. But I like being the one having the conversation now.
-3	negative	emotional-health	People my age that I went to school with are pretty much losers with 50 kids. Lol My life revolves around my home and my children.
-6	negative	emotional-health	People say to forgive and forget, but you can forgive and still not forget. You just can't hold what ever they did to you against them because that means you haven't truly forgiven them.
-1	negative	emotional-health	People think I'm the smiling funny girl on the outside They really don't know.
-1	negative	emotional-health	Please add me and message me! thanks _&lt;;;;
-8	negative	emotional-health	Please. You cant stand me, yet I cannot stand to be without you. You think I'm repulsive, I think you are the most beautiful person I've ever known. My interests bore you, your interests enthral me. You are a genius, I'm a disappointment. You're everything and more, I'm nothing and much much less. You hate me but I love you. You look at me and I'm soaring through the sky, but your eyes say nothing but hate. You make me feel alive. But you kill me every day.
-3	negative	emotional-health	Practically ever weekend during my high school years. It's been close to 6 years now since I've done them. Each time was a whole different experience. I've been on plenty "vision quests". Good times.
-5	negative	emotional-health	Probably am if I have to take antipsychotics. But seriously, my mind races with perpetual thoughts of philosophy and science and math and random things that would drive anyone else insane. Sometimes my mind clutters up with so many thoughts, I just have to sit there and wait for my brain to calm down. There are so many things I can't explain. Maybe I simply am mad.
-4	negative	emotional-health	Psychology studies tell us that changes, even good ones can cause stress in our lives. They look at the number of stressors in a specific period of time.  I am broken. My usual sunny disposition has left me. I am so very tired. This has been such a tough year. I wish for more strength to get through this.
-3	negative	emotional-health	Right now I feel calm and relaxed. I have been thinking of my life and the world, thinking about problems and coming up with solutions. I am taking in the greatness of things, I have a solution to my unhappiness. I feel calm and relaxed right now. 
-1	negative	emotional-health	Right now i feel kind of lost. Not entirely sure what i'm doing or where my life is going, and with not enough close friends to pick me up
-1	negative	emotional-health	Scar on my underbelly: someone tried to attack me with a knife And a few more scars on that I can't talk about
-1	negative	emotional-health	She hung up on me.  I suppose I shouldn't give up just yet but I'm really discouraged so far.
-14	negative	emotional-health	She is perfect. Gets good grades no the highest in the class. Has 17 awards for having the highest mark. Broke our school record and is going to  life sciences and i think she will also get into med school as well. An extraordinary human. On the other side there is me, who wants to be like her.But so jealous. I am not such a great student. I love science and math is my weakness. I am currently getting good mark in science ( by hard work) but who knows the future. Whenever I think about her my belief in my ability stars to decrease. I can't take it anymore. I want to get into med school badly and I am only a grade 9 student and she is graduating. Yesterday I started to prepare for the MCAT test and my mom was like,  you didn't even start high school properly. I ended up understanding nothing and being tired. So in one word i am losing the ability to believe in myself and I get jealous quickly and I am tired.
-7	negative	emotional-health	She says she's fine, but she's going insane, She says she's okay, but really she's not 
-7	negative	emotional-health	She spend her days just blinded by the white walls right before her. These feelings that she carries upon her are ready to burst out into color. She set walls blocking the hurt that she disregards completely. Each and every wall represents a secret, a cheat, and a want.  Written on November 13, 2013
-2	negative	emotional-health	Sigh I'm alone tonight Haven't felt like this in awhile. Can someone  tell a joke or something???!!!!
-23	negative	emotional-health	Since I was really young, my mother has been sick. Sadly that's all I really know, and I always knew that it the end was going to come, I just never knew when. When she got better, it was like a weight was lifted off my shoulders, but it was very short lived. She fell sick again, and it came back stronger and more aggressive. Now, you can see she isn't strong and I'm not sure how much longer she can fight. As cliche as it is, she really is my best friend and one of the few people that truly understands me. Her fire and fight is gone and something in my guy is telling me she won't make it to 2015. I'm just so scared at the fact that my Mum won't meet my children, won't see me get married, or even see me get my degree in 2016. I miss our happy days, when things were fun and free, how ever short lived they may have been. I just wants best friend back. I want my Mum to help me pick my wedding dress and my flowers and I for think she will be here for that. I just want my Mummy back
-1	negative	emotional-health	So, as typical, I begin another 60+ hour work week alone, valued for my work ethic but spurned by my wife. I didn't even say goodbye this AM. Same days it just gets to me but I'll be fine once the inertia os the weekend wears off. I wish I had a real friend to commiserate with. Posting to this site helps take the edge iff but I feel like im stranded on the moon.
-13	negative	emotional-health	So basically I get frequent sharp, fleeting pains in my body. When I was younger people would tell me they were growing pains, but I stopped growing almost 3 years ago. I usually get at least one a day. Last night for example I got this pain in my back that felt like I just got stabbed. Then I felt the same thing in my stomach. Today I got the random pain in my leg.  From what I've looked up online it's currently unexplainable, though many people seem to get these shooting pains. My bizarre theory is that whenever one of our selves from an alternate universe is murdered or injured badly we feel a ghost pain of the incident. That's just fun theory though! In reality it's probably my nerves derping around.
-3	negative	emotional-health	So I decided being the other woman isn't enough. I have said no. It's killing me. Staying strong is so hard.
-3	negative	emotional-health	so.. i don't care if anyone reds this or not.. im just hoping that writing about this would help.. anyone have advice?? lol did anyone read the whole thing??
-10	negative	emotional-health	So in my recent stories I mentioned my desire to sleep with my friend who happens to be straight. So I gave myself a deadline which was the first of the new year. It didn't happen sooooo I decided to give up. I want to thank everyone who gave me advice and wished me good luck. I appreciate it. My New Years resolution is to learn how to go with the flow and be comfortable with everything. I've learned that I can't always get carried away by ONE person. Although I truly like this guy I have to forget about him and well..MOVE ON!!!!!!! Lol 
-7	negative	emotional-health	So, I stayed. I lie, I tell everyone things are better. They are not. I'm just a pathetic little fool. I can't stand the idea of people looking at me with pity anymore so I pretend it's all ok. He never loved me and never really will. That is really the truth. He keeps me around because I do everything for him. I am truly pathetic. I am agreeing to feel unloved, ugly, unwantedfor the rest of my life. I'm the fool for staying.
-3	negative	emotional-health	So it's been a long time since I've posted anything here One of my not so close friends found out about this site and my profile on it and it basically put me off posting anything here.  Ugh I feel so icky about this confession it's not even worded well. I'm going to take my rusty thumbs off my screen now. 
-1	negative	emotional-health	So many different sides. The way I am with my family, friends, strangers, figures of authority, people I hate, people I like, all of my personalities are different. I wish I knew which one is truly me
-7	negative	emotional-health	Someday I want to wake up and feel loved but I never do and I think I never will. I'm afraid I'm forgettable nobody cares I'm afraid no one will ever accept me for the way I am or the way I will be in the future. I feel alone and feel that I'm always going to feel that way like no one's ever going to understand where I'm coming from or understand me at all. I just want to be understood and feel like someone cares.
-3	negative	emotional-health	Some people asked me if I'm sad or anything happened at the first time they see me, well the answer is nope. It's just my flat expression lol -_-
-4	negative	emotional-health	Some people say I'm a strong person. I'm not, I just hide everything I'm feeling from the outside world.
-1	negative	emotional-health	* Some Quotes On Harmony -  * Faith and love are apt to be spasmodic in the best minds. Men live the brink of mysteries and harmonies into which they never enter, and with their hands on the door-latch they die outside.
-1	negative	emotional-health	Sometimes I feel like I'm taking lightly, people assume just cause I'm decent looking I will be a "slag" and cheat on girls, when I've never ever cheated in my life or even thought about it.
-4	negative	emotional-health	Sometimes I feel like my bf doesn't love me as much as he says he does.  The things he does sometimes just make me question his true feelings. And when I ask for reassurance of his love he sometimes gets angry and then emotional. I don't know what this means or why he gets angry/emotional.  I don't like feeling the way I do about it and I don't like upsetting him so I'm in a conflict. I'm especially worried because he is going back to college in a few days 
-2	negative	emotional-health	Sometimes I feel weird, especially when I am the only fat girl in my class. Everyone else is a skinny B*
-2	negative	emotional-health	Some times I hate today's technology. Don't get me wrong I do love it as well and find it all fascinating but with the way everything connects with everything makes it much more risky to communicate.   I can only laugh now.
-1	negative	emotional-health	Sometimes I love being alone, so I can do very crazy, weird things.  I love being weird and crazy. It's very entertaining.
-2	negative	emotional-health	Sometimes in real life its hard to be ur real self either peer pressure or just trying to make a false impression but that is  1 of the beauties of this site you can be real!! I always wanted to know wat ppl think of the real me? Obviously u ppl don't know me at all but from wat u can c wat do u think? Be honest!
-7	negative	emotional-health	Sometimes I sit here with my boyfriend, and I feel as lonely as ever. It's not that he is unwilling to talk to me; about anything I just think the adderall we are taking drives us apart. We are both prescribed it and he has ADHD and I also have a small problem concentrating but we use it recreationally and it's coming between us. We don't always abuse it but when we do it's like a wall goes up. Idk I'm babbling. My point is I want this to stop before it drives us apart.
-4	negative	emotional-health	"Sometimes I smile because I'm happy, and sometimes I'm only happy because I remember to smile." I think smiling does something to you chemically - it can actually make you feel better.
-10	negative	emotional-health	Some times, i want to lose weight, like today when i see photo of my old girl friend (just friend) i dont see her 2 years. Now she is 12 years old , like me, she allways be chubby like me but now, i see she was lose weight and look not bad too. But i still think i must be who i am, so, now i still want gaining weight (slowly)
-1	negative	emotional-health	Sometimes I wish I could just get up and leave. Pack my bags and go anywhere in the world. Even only for a week. To just escape all my problems and be alone. Not have to face anyone and not have to worry about the consequences. I know that won't solve anything though. You can keep running away from your problems 
-1	negative	emotional-health	Sometimes when it's sunny outside I go an lay on the driveway and just take in the sun rays
-2	negative	emotional-health	Sometimes you try very hard but you can't fix things. You only frustrate yourself trying to. The best thing to do is accept defeat and let go, move on to something else. Maybe even something better. Who knows?
-1	negative	emotional-health	Somewhere between reality and a bad dream my head heard the words you were saying but my heart could not. The sound of the keys scraping the pole echoed to the furthest corners  of my mind desperately trying to escape the imprisonment of my disbelief.
-1	negative	emotional-health	So much pain in my heart losing something u care for. Hurting every minute of the day depression stronger than any force on earth taking my soul away from the light
-5	negative	emotional-health	So my airman texted me last night at 0330 saying "don't wake up but" Ummm yeah I'm awake now lol but the good news was that he has found somewhere to live  he was completely stressing that he wouldn't find somewhere in him time limit but he did and it was one of the houses I suggested haha now he just has to get all moved in, go collect his car from LA somehow and get settled. I'm so happy that he includes me in all this stuff although none of it really effects or involves me.  The bad news was that he lost a dear friend, he was pretty cut up about it but we talked it through and hopefully it helped him at least a little. I just wish I could be closer so I could hug him and tell him everything will be okay.
-11	negative	emotional-health	So my brother and I started a podcast called "Life According to Brothers" and talk about our life experiences, how we got through them, and what we've learned. My brother is the funny one and I anchor the show down and try to keep it semi-serious. I think the contrast between out personalities works well. He breaks out into song at times and I come back with witty remarks. But we always have a good time and look forward to answering questions and meeting new people who have had some great experiences.
-15	negative	emotional-health	So my daughter mite have broken her toe I ask my husband 2 take her get an X-ray he was like she should go 2 school & see how it goes if it hurts take a Tylenol & I'll take her Tuesday to the dr if stil hurst?!!! What the heck??? The toe is purple.. Meaning I have 2 miss work & take her today. I don't understand him?? I have a boss & he doesn't kuz he has his own bussiness ?? That hasn't make any money, but he stil has it !!!! I can't wait 2 divorce this man .. I knew he was being 2 nice lately !! Can't wait 2 be own my own !!
-2	negative	emotional-health	SoOoOo I started the "8 hour diet" basically you choose a time period during the day in which u eat whatever u want (mine is 9am to 5pm) you don't eat until after 9am and you Don't eat after 5pm until the next day etc. it's an excellent diet I've done it in the past and it has definitely worked for metakes away from having night foods 
-2	negative	emotional-health	So she says laughingly,  where have you been all of my life?   Picking up the photo of her beginning, she traces the outlines of her past, searching for clues.  She wonders if she should just leave well enough alone.  Could the truth be much different from her imaginings?   Time for the present.  Time for reality.  Push back the shadows and snap back.  
-1	negative	emotional-health	So This Is My Story Now we are secretly dating and Karina has no Idea!
-10	negative	emotional-health	So today, I plucked up the courage to ask someone I don't know out. I have never in my life done anything like that before and I don't think I ever will again haha! I've met him twice, and he works in a shoe shop that's pretty local. So today I asked him whether he'd go out with me sometime, and he told me he had a girlfriend  I'm actually genuinely gutted! Knocked my confidence a bit  thought something good might come of it 
-1	negative	emotional-health	so upset. lets just say ur not my friend anymore.
-5	negative	emotional-health	So, who's to determine who's gone mad or not? Much like every other emotion, the individual dictates if they have gone mad. I feel nothing anymore. To the point where I'm suffocating and I don't care. I don't blend in with this cruel world. I don't feel I belong. Who's to say I've gone mad and that I am just speaking the truth?
-4	negative	emotional-health	So yeah, I am different . Id get treated horrible for just the way I am . Nothing is really different about me except my plugs and hair most of the time & my personality . What's so wrong about that ? . Why did I get called the "emo" girl . If I looked nothing like one . Sure I like rock bands , that doesn't mean anything, just because I don't wear pink doesn't make me any less of a girl ?!  Being different is a good thing , it shows who you are as a person. not something or someone your supposed to look like , 
-3	negative	emotional-health	Speaking of pulverized coal in the previous section we get a lot of applications in industry, but also describes the production process of pulverized coal in india. Now we'll explore the factors that define the coal fineness and combustion conditions.
-2	negative	emotional-health	Speaking of the two sections of our competitive Australian market grinding equipment, grinding equipment and maintenance problems . However, in the case of deterioration of the global environment , various countries have energy-saving , environmental protection , energy requirements increased mining industry with high technical content of the new energy-saving devices are also increasingly being favored by mining development . In addition, with the increasing scale of the industry and increase the level of technology, new environmental and energy-saving equipment costs reduced, so comparison with ordinary grinding devices, environmentally friendly energy-saving grinding equipment and machineries in Australia have a better market better to be optimistic and use of mining developers. 
-2	negative	emotional-health	STOOOP!! Pleaseeeee!! I'm a girl!! I'm supposed to be petite and cute (>.&lt I'm a little taller than all my friends, and the same height as my mum. It's so awkward, plus, I'm skinny, so I look really stupid and lanky. ;o;
-6	negative	emotional-health	Stressed. Depression. Sadness. Self-pity. Regret. These are but a few of the words that come to mind when trying to describe my mood as of late.  You know, I should really write on EP after I've taken a Xanax. I've only one left and I'm saving it, but I feel like I could calmly and productively get a lot off my chest on here while on it.
-9	negative	emotional-health	Such an ugly characteristic trait In an encounter I had with other girls off the Internet, it was indeed very scary. One girl was bisexual and my good friend, very close like impossible to separate us. She didn't ever try to get with me, but her desire to always wear boy things while I am girly in my fashions helped people think we were lesbians and she was a BD. She wasn't. Anyways this other woman was also bisexual and was always trying to get with this other one. She kept getting rejected. She became very jealous of me. I cannot stand jealousy. Especially if it's misguided. She tried to get some of her friends who were also my friends to beat me up and kill me. All because she was convinced her crush wanted me instead of her. Jealousy can really cloud your mind and disillusion your reality.
-3	negative	emotional-health	Sun worship. I adore the feel of the sun kissing my body, a rich lover does Abellio appear to me each summers day.
-3	negative	emotional-health	SWEETHEART Also I believe that because I have a disability so I'm not exactly attractive or good looking but I'm really nice and friendly to make up for the looks so people should go for my personality!
-6	negative	emotional-health	technically if you think about it the statement, the sky is not blue, can be true. Here is why, sometimes the sky can be orange, red, or yellow, and at night the sky is black. This thought has lead me to think about other things that are commonly thought of as false, but are actually true. for example, people say you cant lick your elbow, but technically you could, if you dislocated your arm.
-4	negative	emotional-health	Thanks to me adding her on FB without realizing it was her, she inadvertently found my husband. They have bee chatting it up about old times a lot lately and it bothers me, I know it shouldn't and that i am being irrational.  I don't know how to handle this.
-2	negative	emotional-health	That is how I feel. Sometimes I feel like I am not a real person.
-7	negative	emotional-health	That is how I spent a significant amount of my adolescence, alone in my room. I lived with an abusive stepfather and I avoided him as much as possible in the only place I could be. My dad died when I was ten and so was out of the picture. Essentially, I had to grow up by myself for much of my life.  
-2	negative	emotional-health	that is why I loce summer the most. I would rather life in the Sahara when for example in the artic XD
-1	negative	emotional-health	That's the great thing about living in California - it's always sunny and mostly warm so you can always get some sun during the day. Not like Canada, where I'm from originally - it's winter half the year there!
-3	negative	emotional-health	The best thing about mistakes is that know one can truthfully say they don't make mistakes because without mistakes we would be perfect and know one is perfect because perfect never had a true definition to applying to human beings.
-12	negative	emotional-health	The boy that I love for a year now has broken me apart. I realized now that ive changed him hes changed me. He tells me hes change but I just don't believe him. I'm not used to itI was used to him hurting me all the time. Everything I had..TRUST is gone. When I tell him I want to breakup..he get all suicidaland then I cant help but stay. I fell in love to fast
-2	negative	emotional-health	The Curse of Being Capricorn This story is from my book, Someday I'm Going To . . . by Brad Rudisail, available on Amazon
-5	negative	emotional-health	the day before Christmas Eve I got fired And guess what it was? I was blamed for buying drugs at work. Actually didn't buy drugs but nobody would believe me I offered for them to investigate take a drug test do anything they refused and I got fired in a week later I got accused of stealing money I don't see why I always get blamed for things I just always tend to get blamed for everything
-6	negative	emotional-health	The fragility of a BPD woman can also plug into a mans hero complex. Her constant need for reassurance and support can exaggerate an insecure persons sense of importance. In fact, its not uncommon for narcissistic men to gravitate to BPD women, because each disorder serves the other, says Freed.The borderline patient's overt vulnerability confirms the narcissists power, which typically is his driving concern, even if he rarely talks about it, he says. Going out with a borderline can be exhilarating for these men because their partner becomes focused on them. sounds exactly like me (npd) and my wife(bpd)
-8	negative	emotional-health	The hardest part is the not knowing. We have no real answers. What happened?  I don't understand and it really hurts. Maybe someday, she'll call, if she's not dead, strung out on drugs (not likely, but again, none of this was likely) or brainwashed. But she'll have to live with the choices she has made, and how they have hurt the people that loved her. Maybe someday. Until then, everyday I try not to cry
-7	negative	emotional-health	The mere belief in something can trigger a world of feelings. The time you heard some good news. When it turned out to be untrue. Etc. Mere ideas can trigger such powerful reactions in us. It's how we relate to them. Makes me curious. It seems silly with such light to pretend change is beyond reach for any reason.
-1	negative	emotional-health	The name of the experience sums it all up too perfectly
-1	negative	emotional-health	The pain is becoming to much ive tried to fight this depression but i just cant its eating away at me its killing me i just cant take it anymore ..i realy cant i feel deadim hurting so bad i just cant go on like this i realy realy cant i can't fight this pain i just want to sleep and never wake up ..at least ill be with my dad ..hes up there waiting for me im crying almost all the time i feel so alone:'( :'(
-2	negative	emotional-health	There are many of these things but I am who I am and life moves on, now it is just a matter of waiting for the future to take its course.
-20	negative	emotional-health	There are many things that I want to change. But the most troubling  and one I'm constantly reminded of is that I can't joke. I mean, I have like nil sense of humor and totally bore the people I talk to. I can laugh along with others at their jokes but when it comes to me relating a funny incident I can make it sound like it was the most boring thing ever done. I know the people who can make everyone laugh at simple things just by the way they tell it. I think I'm losing some of friends because they are starting to realize that I'm just a book worm who tops in the class every term but doesn't know a thing when it comes to humor. It's not like I'm anti-social. I love to make friends and get to know new people. I start off really well with almost everyone but that's all it is to it. They all leave me stranded. I wish I could change this. I know I can change this. Maybe someone can tell me how.
-2	negative	emotional-health	There are so many things I want to tell you.
-2	negative	emotional-health	There are things in my life that are forcing me to stay here, otherwise I would have no reason to live anymore.  I don't want to hurt my family, and that is the main reason I am still here. If I were gone I would leave them with all of my school loans and that would be awful. I feel like a waste of space most of the time and that this world will most likely function better without me. It feels uncomfortable to let people i care about know how I feel. I keep everything in. I am a different person to my family than what i admit to on here. I've tried to make myself feel better by expressing myself here. I know I am a coward for feeling the way that i feel. But its difficult for me to feel any other way.  Turtlebrainx27
-8	negative	emotional-health	There are times in which I am an open book, but usually this happens, when I have become comfortable with those around me. Generally, I have never been fond of large groups as in group settings. I tend to enjoy smaller group settings, because I feel it is easier to get to know others in that setting. I think like everyone else, we are all a work in progress. However, it takes time even if it means taking small steps, to a larger goal. 
-8	negative	emotional-health	There are times when the body is comfortably at ease and the soul a bit restless with silent searching and contemplation. It is times like these when I often find my thoughts drifting back through the years to the people, places and events of days gone by.  The things most treasured in our memories are the things that make us who we are. They are the things that have been etched upon our hearts and soulsmarking us permanently with the traces of their gentle touch whilst the after-glow of their embers fill our hearts with warmth, comfort and peacethus welcoming us home once again.
-1	negative	emotional-health	The reason I feel like this is complicated.  Maybe I am just being paranoid, or feeling a bit lonelier than usual, but I feel like I have no solid ground - I have nobody of my own.  
-3	negative	emotional-health	The reason I say I am ok , I have so many issues in my life, I think its best to not say how I am
-14	negative	emotional-health	There comes a time in life when I have to say enough is enough no matter how much it hurts. Iv cried today and I have decided I am tired of crying and feeling this pain in my heart. I am done and need to let go and move on, all I am doing is hurting myself more and more and I am tired. I can let go I know I can I feel strong enough to do so and on my weak days when I wake up and miss and hurt I will suppress it get up and pretend they never existed. I will never look back because I think that is where I have been going wrong, I will never open my heart to anyone nor trust. I am done with being walked over now X
-4	negative	emotional-health	There has only been one time where I've heard " I love you" from a guy. And although I know he meant it I just didn't feel the same. I want to hear those words from someone that I feel the same way about. But clearly I'm asking to much.
-9	negative	emotional-health	There is a tipping point, a line which once crossed I know there can be no return. I crave what's on the other side, that beast inside my head that batters and tears against the cage that holds it as it screams in rage. I have thoughts and desires no person should have to live with, fantasies that would make a half-sane person vomit at the faintest glimpse and they linger there in the dark, starved but not defeated. Like a vampire in a bad horror movie unable to be killed and waiting for the slightest taste of blood to rise needing to feast even more.  I must starve the beast once more, hold fast against the creaking timbers of the cage as the demon fights knowing that it must break free now, at this moment, this time while it is strong and I am weak and distracted by thoughts of an angel instead of watching mindfully as the timbers crack.
-1	negative	emotional-health	There is nothing better in the world than a sunny day at the beach with the sun on your skinand feeling that warmth all the way down into your bones
-5	negative	emotional-health	There is one girl in particular who I wish I was. Her name is Alex Johnson. She sort of has a personality just like mine, very sweet and soft spoken, open-minded and creative, except she's more outgoing, and a LOT prettier. She is gorgeous in fact. Gosh, I am extremely jealous of her because I wish I had her face, her body, everything. But she doesn't know. It's not fair, and I know it's not healthy but I guess the best I can do is to just try to forget I'd ever met her.
-6	negative	emotional-health	There's too much responsibility! The expectations are sky high! There are so many things I have to do as time running out! Help! I also find that people expect you to do things in time like everything has to be done as there's a time bomb. I give you an example of what I mean, When I finish college everyone was desperate and kept really pushing me to go to university and I was like stop! Why? There's no rush! No Time limit and I can go to uni at any age jeez! I'm not ready! I'm glad I did put my foot down and said what I wanted to do and not been told what to do and regret it! So if you haven't done something then apparently it's too late when in reality it isn't as you have all the time in the world! If you haven't done something then people just don't wanna know and just leave ignore you just like that!
-5	negative	emotional-health	The sad little girl inside me is obsessed with having an ideal, affectionate and caring mother figure that would hold her, love her unconditionally and would never rejected or abandoned her. Those women are always heterosexual women in their 30-40s. Right now i am having a motherly obsession with a woman in her 60. I just wish i could hold her, to cuddle with her to comfort the sad and terrify little girl inside me. I always getting rejected and abandoned by those women i got myself attached to. They were all my therapists, teachers, and even the librarian at my college. Sigh..I hate being so obsessed with being love by an older women just to comfort that little girl inside me. I am so tired of it.
-4	negative	emotional-health	The sad part is, I do have emotional intimacy in my relationship.  I just have the hardest time feeling it, even when he makes it so obvious.
-10	negative	emotional-health	These days i am so confused for no reason. Nothing bad is going on in my life and God forbid that anything bad happens, but I just don't feel happy in any way except for when i go to school and am with my friends. When i'm home i want to be in a dark room with no one around me. In school while playing gym while we are sitting and waiting for our team to play. i sometimes just feel sad all of a sudden and i don't know why. Now i listen to songs that match my feelings and yet i'm confused with my feelings I don't know what it is.  I feel some sort of desperateness and the need of something but yet i don't know what it is. It is very hard. I am distracted by it sometimes when i'm studying or talking with someone. but sometimes i wanna be alone so i can think to myself. 
-7	negative	emotional-health	These days I've just felt so lost. I'm not sure exactly how to explain it. I just feel like I have no purpose. Nothing worth doing. I felt like a failure, hopeless. Like people just pretend to be nice. It makes me mad when I know someone's just pretending and it makes me feel hurt and like I'm nothing. I'm so tired of living. I'm tired physically and emotionally. I'm exhausted.
-3	negative	emotional-health	The spirit of happiness has to be with you already to be built upon. It starts within and and spreads outwards like ripples in a pond. When you are happy the slightest thing will add, when you are sad, look to yourself, start the smile there. 
-9	negative	emotional-health	The thing is.. I actually don't feel all that ugly. I don't feel like their are ugly people. I remember a friend of mine saying about this girl: "I can't believe someone can be that ugly!" I taught the girl she was pointing at was beautiful, in her own way, not model-beauty, just beautiful. She's not longer my friend by the way, that's not the kind of people I want to have around, but back then, she used to be one of the few people I got. It's strange, back when it didn't bother me all that much, I had no friends, now that I do have people who are supportive, I never cared more about others opinions.
-4	negative	emotional-health	The trouble with being an introvert (though I'm social) is meeting up with those gems in a crowd who are operating like me. When you find those people they are kindred souls in an instant and may prove to be lifelong friends!
-5	negative	emotional-health	The two main emotions are love and fear. All other emotions stem from these two emotions. Fear creates longer wave lengths and love corrects smaller wave lengths. It's sort of like schemas in psychology. The more schemas that you develop makes it much easier to make it from point a to point z. More pathways are provided with love
-5	negative	emotional-health	The universe is a hologram! ?? This paper is worth a read!  . Just trying to wrap my mind around this cannot be expressed in words. I'm so excited for this, we get closer and closer to the unravelling the truth about the universe, yet we find that we are so far. I can't wait to see what comes next!
-2	negative	emotional-health	The very word grates on my nerves like nails on a chalkboard. There is so much chaos around me. I try my best to avoid it, keep it at bay. I just want peace, happiness, friends, laughter. I don't think that is too much to ask. Slowly, steadily, I am pushing out the chaos with optimism, finding harmony in simplicity and a sense of humor, however wry.
-6	negative	emotional-health	The woman who raised me was mentally ill. I didn't know this until I was an adult. This is partly what made the effects of her parenting, her energy, and her spirit so devastating for me. In a nutshell, my connection for such a prolonged period of time at such a tender age to this very sick woman consumed all of my fire. I have to keep reminding myself that it's over now and it is okay. I can see my own light.  
-4	negative	emotional-health	They are trashy people & I can't get along with them to save my life. Guess why they don't like me because I'm nothing like them. It's sad that in order to be liked I have to lower myself to their level but I refuse. I'm tired of my boyfriend getting treated like crap while his two brothers get treated like gold all because they have reproduced. It's sickening that they are like that all they care about is having kids they can pollute with their ignorance.
-6	negative	emotional-health	They say that meditation is a door to find the "true yourself" and the inner happiness that's not influenced by external life. They say that in order to meditate, you have to relax your body through techniques like breathing exercises. And they say that meditation is about focusing on one subject and to control our monkey-mind not to be distracted by thoughts or ideas. Thanks in advantage for your answers 
-5	negative	emotional-health	This actually happens to me a lot. It could be the reason why I'm so sleep deprived sometimes. It seems like all my thoughts come to haunt me at night. I've felt really stressed these past few months with school and worrying about this and that.
-5	negative	emotional-health	this girl in my highschool is beautiful, i dont know her or talk to her at all, but when i see her she makes me super nervous. One day she seen me starring and ever since that day we always make eye contact , but we never talk.
-13	negative	emotional-health	This has ALWAYS been a huge problem for me. I usually just shut up and lock it inside. Lately I've had a lot of trouble around friends and family so it came to a point I'm trying something totally new to myselfI'm just slowly attempting to warm up to someone I've known for 2 years and has never upset me. I'm scared if things go wrong, but so far she likes me telling her because she never had any idea. Saying your feelings can just be so hardespecially when they take it the wrong way. I can't even tell certain people I'm mad at them without them running off all mad at me back and making it sound like it's my fault!
-1	negative	emotional-health	this has everything to do with self esteem and body image, ready story about body image issues.
-4	negative	emotional-health	This is a good point to make for tonight.. I'm sitting here basically alone, (even tho he is sitting across from me) drinking some wine and sitting in silence and being ignored.. Any attempt on my part to strike up conversation just ends with him being ignorant.. Telling me to move out and calling me names.. I just wish he would make the first move and file for divorce Already.. If he doesn't want to be with me then what's the hold up.. If I had money of my own I think I'd of filed already I just don't know why I keep trying to hold on to someone who obliviously doesn't want me anymore.. But he won't leave and would rather make me and the kids suffer.. UGHHH
-2	negative	emotional-health	This is a Q to my fellow OW out there with no kids of their own and have MM with a child. How have you dealt with this?  Ladies.. Advice?
-1	negative	emotional-health	This is going to be my second night of thinking
-4	negative	emotional-health	This is my first post here, and I know this isn't a dating site, so I'm sorry if this is the wrong place to talk about it. 
-11	negative	emotional-health	This is my story.  After my engagement was called off, I swore off men and only occasionally started dating after a year but nothing serious. Imagine my surprise one day when I checked my email and there was an email from him from a business network website. I couldn't believe how he had found me. A lot of the emotions came rushing back although it had been close to five years since we last kept in touch. I finally emailed him back and he told me that he is now divorced and he wanted to reconnect. I don't know whether I should be happy or that I should just forget him and just move on. I am afraid that of getting crushed again if this (whatever this is) doesn't work out. We still live in different states and he has his daughter you know. Let me know what you think.
-1	negative	emotional-health	This is something that I can never find though i find I hold enough emotions for two people lol  but having a relationship with myself is not truly satisfying. (:
-5	negative	emotional-health	This is the first time ever I am talking about what happened to me. I realized it later in life that I was a victim of abuse. I may have survived with my virginity intact but I have lost my innocence. I am so angry all the time. I feel so frustrated about my state and I cant seem to stop thinking about what happened to me as a kid.
-10	negative	emotional-health	This may not seem like an extreme addiction, but there are la All I can say is, I feel like we're on two different worlds.  I love him, but he's turning out to not be the man I thought he would be when it came time to grow up, get job so I can take a break from being the only one making enough money to pay the bills, and prepare for parenthood.  He doesn't want to grow with me.  He's content on his couch with his laptop, x-box, and bag of weed.  And he's almost 30 years old.  He's never going to change, and I don't know how to tell him that he's worrying me about how reliable he'll be as a husband and parent in the future.  
-6	negative	emotional-health	This Mistake Is By Far The Worst I've made many mistakes throughout my life, but recently, I've made the biggest mistake I've ever made. I hurt someone I care about dearly, and I'm afraid they hate me now. I really messed up this time. by trying to protect myself from more heartache, I ended up hurting the person I care about most. I'm hoping I'll get another chance to fix it before the damage is permanent. 
-1	negative	emotional-health	This moment, I could be the most optimistic guy in the room. The next moment, I can be sorrow about myself. 
-11	negative	emotional-health	This morning around 2am I received an email from him. He called me sweetheart and let me know that his travel went alright (to where he will be in Afghanistan) and he said he hopes that everything is going good here for me.  I got that message and felt both a moment of happinessbut it was followed fear. I could not handle it if something DID happen to him. Andwhat happens if he comes back and just like 5 years ago after his first deploymenthe detaches from me again. its a defense with him. Buthow can I fight that.
-15	negative	emotional-health	This sorta relates back to the whole I want everyone to be happy, have a good time type of thing. The way I see it is everyone has problems in their life some big some small fact of the matter is everyone has at least one. I don't want to dump my issues on someone else for them to worry about me or blow up on me if they take it the wrong way. Truth be told since the start of the year I've been in and out of poor crappy health. It seems like my heavy drinking ways are catching up with me or has caught up with me. My liver has been giving me issues on and off I honestly feel as if my time is coming. I could be wrong but that's just what I think it's one of those weird feelings.
-2	negative	emotional-health	This sounds like one of those very adolescent and immature thing to feel rejected about, but I was picked last. Actually,  I wasn't picked at all
-12	negative	emotional-health	Those pictures. You both look happy. Ouch!! I get jealous!! That was hurting!! It felt like my heart wanted to erupt! But I should let go honey because I really love you so much I should just bow my head, cry my heart out and walkway. I know God has planned something great for me. I love you.
-3	negative	emotional-health	Thoughts I might have slight Maladaptive daydreaming But get it towards the end of the day. Like from 9:30pm-3:00am, I can't stop thinking. I create many stories that go on and on. And I'm literally in the situation.
-16	negative	emotional-health	To become who I want, is but a distant sight from who I am. I see the terrain before me, have the urge to track on, but can't seem to take the first step. I wonder if I'm as scared as I say others are to becoming new in a new frontier of existence. I am gaining more distance than earlier before. Why am I taking these steps backwards? I do not want a push from behind. I want to be the one, with confidence, with eyes set on the gold before me, in awe at the sight and let it fill me. To give me the courage again to take the next step. 'One step at a time gets me to where I'm going.' But why, why am I still sitting thinking and dreaming as I witness the sight fade in the distance? Does this life they set for me have my balls in their hands? I sit in silent screams of agony. How much pain do I have to endure for myself to finally get up and leave it behind? Please, don't let it fade out of sight, only to have been a dream!
-2	negative	emotional-health	To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.     -Ralph Waldo Emerson
-7	negative	emotional-health	Today as I woke up, I started thinking. I've lied to so many people, telling them that "I'm ok".  I'm not entirely sure if I am ok or in distress.  I guess I can't think of it know.  I've got work too do.  I just needed to get this thought out of my head, before I did something stupid.
-19	negative	emotional-health	Today he talked about the future again. We haven't seen each other since Tuesday, but we talk on the phone at least for a little while every weekday. He asked if I would change my last name. He said it means a lot to a man. Its a sign of commitment. His wife hyphenated. She told him it was so she could easily drop the extra name if anything happened. Well, now she can drop it, as she so clearly wanted to. I never took my H's name. It's true. It's a sign of love and commitment to some extent. If you think you will be together forever, then why wouldn't you change your name?  I was also really surprised/pleased to find out he had done his own research on women dating men with children. He knew how hard this was for me. Knowing he's been doing some research, learning a little more about what it is for me - what it will mean for our future - it was kind of incredible. 
-6	negative	emotional-health	Today i"m having a dinner in the church . We have to served our parents it was going to be fun except my mom refused to come she would rather go with her friends rather then spend time with me . I was realy upset i"m the only one who came with a dad without a mother..
-2	negative	emotional-health	To hate yourself and with you could change. But eventually you have to learn to be happy you're alive and love yourself  even on your worst days, you're beautiful.
-4	negative	emotional-health	To me making people smile is probably the best feeling for me  when a girl tells me a made them smile I'm just like omg! 
-1	negative	emotional-health	To my husband,My mind bogged down, with wasted words.
-2	negative	emotional-health	To this day I still put on a fake smile on my face every single day. Honestly I'm so good at that people can't even tell when I'm happy or sad. Its almost like what one of my friends told me. Thanks for reading and remember happiness is a smile away 
-13	negative	emotional-health	Two days ago, I went back to my hometown in Shibuya to visit my cousins and little brother. We were having a sleepover that night and after we took a shower we went to my dad's room to talk. My two cousins and my brother suddenly got bored and decided they wanted to play jump rope with a blanket they brought. After we returned to our house in Minato, all I did was worry, worry and worry about Jun's poor hand (Jun is my little brother's name) but luckily, it's healing well and he's now as bossy as ever, even though he has a sling now, but he can still play with his DS, so it's fine 
-2	negative	emotional-health	Unlucky 8s 4 + 4 = Oh, I'm an unlucky 8.  That explains it.  If only mom and dad could have waited one night to get it on.
-1	negative	emotional-health	Update! I am currently 170 pounds, 43 inches around the largest part of my belly, 38 inches around the smallest part of my belly. (I'm 5'8") hoping to get up to 180 by valentines day
-5	negative	emotional-health	Vibes, energy:  I  started to work with my gift at the age of 7. And of course we all know what they tell us, what people hidewhat is to come, what happened.but sometimes they don't let things happen. Personally im still young so I have much to learn. I have been trying to understand my gift and be in a stable relationship but every time it ends because I "assume" too much.the saddest part is that I'm almost always right.it's hard to explain a gift to others and not let it ruin a relationship.help!!
-3	negative	emotional-health	We all have our issues. We all have our weaknesses. I'll get around it it one day.
-1	negative	emotional-health	Weighed in today and I'm now 469 that's 43 pounds down from 512 in 2 months. I'm excited, and look forward to continuing losing more. It has been hard work and learning boundaries with food.  
-3	negative	emotional-health	We live in the age of texting and Facebook as suitable ways to maintain friendships. They help, but I want something real.
-5	negative	emotional-health	Well hello first timer, I admit to who ever is out there I need help, I need someone to talk to who I can relate too. It's been a hard life. I can never see clearly if you get what I mean. So I guess message me anybody
-4	negative	emotional-health	Well i am officially at 170!! i'm definitely feeling the extra weight, but i am going to probably start getting back in shape soon! (;
-4	negative	emotional-health	Well im writing this not in regard to spring or summer but in regard to autumn and winter. I love when its cool or cold out and for me Im searching for that little bit or warmth on my skin to make me get in the comfort zone and then out of nowhere the sun peeks out from behind the clouds and it hits my skin and bathes me in a warm feeling though it may be cool or cold outside.Its really a great feeling I then stand there and bask in the moment being grateful that life is so good and that simple things such as this are such an enjoyment to me.
-9	negative	emotional-health	WellI think that I am a deep thinkerand I have done a lot of thinking about that. Some people might say that I am a simpleton and that my thoughts are shallow or insignificantbut I actually spend hours pondering everything under the sun. I think about things too much and drive myself insane and go on mad crazy blogging bingesand I am like a zombie, glued to EP writing about everything that I spend so much time thinking about. 
-3	negative	emotional-health	Well i've done quite a few things i'm not proud of and i'll never will be. Some of it might be things people think are just horrible. But i'm improving. I'm not that person anymore.  Yeah, i guess i'm human like everyone else.
-20	negative	emotional-health	Well my ex bf his from  Iran and he broke up with me a few months ago and  sopously we stayed as friends.. And his been ignoring me and avoiding me and I have tried 2 weeks to be friends and I texted him and he said " I'm Ignoring u cause I don't want to hurt u" and then I texted him another day and he said "I'm going to ignore u that's my decision and aint no one change that" and I was like fine .. So I've been Ignoring him and talking to this new kid(which speaks Spanish (my native language) and I caught him staring at me a few times as well as my friends And one day my Spanish friend goes for a smoke and then he goes out too but I thought he would meet one of his friends outside .. But NOOO he was talking with my Spanish friend and my Spanish friend didn't know I dated him.  Sorry it's long xD
-5	negative	emotional-health	well today has had its up and downs, but he finally made it to qatar around 11:00am this morning.. my time i havent heard from him since.. and i swear talking to him for five minutes meant everything to me but when you go from texting/calling each other everyday to this its a hard adjustment. i miss him soo much.. 
-4	negative	emotional-health	What does everyone eat to sustain their body figure.. eating before I sleep, doing that starve yourself thingy to trick my metabolism into conservative mode so I use less calories then like a day later I scarf And I also work-out before I eat, 'cause I think that helps as well (I read it somewhere). 
-2	negative	emotional-health	What is the point of going to medical professionals? Thank you
-3	negative	emotional-health	When ever I meet new people I just think that they gonna be nice and that oh what ever I don't get too close to them but I dunno i just don't trust no one even my closes friends and family.
-11	negative	emotional-health	When everyone else is having a great time with their families on Christmas including your ex and kids are off spending time with family and you were suppose to have that too but you don't, and instead I am all alone, which I choose due to my depression. I am happy for my boys, I want them to be loved and feel love, they are most important, but I was suppose to be a part of all that.  I was told that she would never give up on us and never stop fighting. I always forgave her and was here no matter what. Now she abandoned me and her promise and has forced me out of my kids life and it kills me inside. What is the point of life? Why does someone go against their word, I have lost faith in humanity and love, I don't trust or believe anymore. And now it's Christmas and cold and gross, so depression has set in even more.
-6	negative	emotional-health	When I'm sad about a little thing like spilling a drink on my shirt or my computer freezing I cry,I get sick over it,I go into a depression. When I'm happy about a little thing like my favorite show being on or someone I like writing to me,I smile and laugh and scream in joy and even jump up and down happy as hell! When I'm angry about a little thing like my chair being caught on the rug or someone being annoying I want to kill people,I scream cuss words,and I break things. When I;m scared of a little thing like meeting someone new,or even going to a store,I go into panic attacks and don't sleep and I drink my weight in booze so I won't end up dying! Lastly and the most intense of all,when I'm in love,I tell the person right away,I ask them to marry me expecting a no on the first week,I carry them home and kiss them andwell.goths are better in bed they say *wink*.
-11	negative	emotional-health	When it comes to your car, your brakes are not something to mess around with. Having a car that will not stop reliably is dangerous, to put it mildly. You are actually putting your life at risk if your car is not stopping, as it should, not to mention the lives of those on the road with you. However, knowing when it is time for brake repair is not always as simple as you might want it to be. Some problems with your brakes are not dangerous, while other seemingly insignificant details can lead to big, big problems. If your vehicle is turning on the ABS system when it shouldn't, you will notice your brakes gripping and releasing during a normal stopping situation. This is definitely a time for brake repair. You want your ABS system working properly, especially when you start driving in difficult weather situations. Similarly, if you feel your brakes are "grabbing," then have them looked at. It is always better safe than sorry when working with your vehicle's brakes. 
-11	negative	emotional-health	When I told everyone that I'm not going anymore they didn't seem to care, they didn't even look at me, they just continued to use their phones and ignored me. She said to everyone how come you guys aren't telling her to go, they still didn't look nor did the look like they cared. I thought since we got to know each other now, I thought we were on the level where we won't leave each other out, but I guess not, I don't have anything to do with them out of our zone, other then the zone, Id rather not see them. I know I sound harsh, but the feeling I got back made me look like I wasn't worthy of anything, me saying these things is as hurtful as what they gave me.
-2	negative	emotional-health	When I try to talk to people about my problems, I sometimes find their responses more hurtful than helpful. 
-5	negative	emotional-health	When i was 6, our family moved from guelph ontario, to vancouver BC. that was the frustration of being a kid sometimes. no one listens to you. but the thing was i was a very sensitive child so i understood things very well and that was one thing that made me feel very sad as child. because i knew what i was talking about but no one listens or just thinks im making it up. thats why i just became very quiet and learned to not bother talking to much people anymore.
-9	negative	emotional-health	When I was a kid, around 1st and 2nd grade, I cried all the time. I cried if I fell, I cried if I lost something, I cried if I was scared, I cried if I was hurt.  I have lost something very personal and important.
-20	negative	emotional-health	When I was in elementry school I was the target of every person I met. I litterally had one friend, and I'm very proud to say she is still my friend today. At first the solution was to always laugh at myself and laugh with the jokes kids made about me, but eventually I couldn't even pretend it was okay. They moved from little jokes here and there, to violence and class mates plotting against me. A girl told the principal I had hit her to get me suspended. I would have been considered innocent if her friends hadn't said the same thing. I had never touched any of them. And the worst was the day I came home with a black eye because a boy in my class threw a chair at my head. As I got older and atarted using social networking sites so did everyone else. And they all used them to tell me how worthless I was. And when no one likes you, eventually you stop liking you too.
-3	negative	emotional-health	When my cuts get lonely they need friends So I make them new friends  And the cycle never ends
-5	negative	emotional-health	When someone asks what's wrong, I say I'm fine, but I have those few friends that know when I'm lying. I want to tell them, but at the same time I don't. Even when I try to tell them, I don't know how to explain the pain in my heart. I hate crying, especially in front of people. It makes me feel so weak. My friends try to help, but they don't understand at all. Very few do, but most don't. The more pain, the harder it is to explain.
-2	negative	emotional-health	When somethings wrong , i sometimes keep it to myself . I find it hard to tell others . But when i do it gets a little better , as i know someone knows my feelings . But still , i simply cannot express the way i feel in one word or a phrase . Its much more than that ~
-7	negative	emotional-health	When there is something on my mind there is nothing better than being able to share it To share it with someone who understands me, who gets me, who doesn't judge me but merely understands just where I am coming from.
-1	negative	emotional-health	Who can make me laugh!?!?  I bet you can't
-1	negative	emotional-health	Who else has been getting some awesome downloads from this amazing energy thats been coming down?
-8	negative	emotional-health	Why am I here in this little world nobody likes me I'm not important in no type of ways. Have no friends I just sad . Wondering what I did to them . Nobody pays me any mind. If I left nobody would care . I have them thoughts where I want to hurt myself . Im lonely don't know what to do anymore. I banned myself from all the social networks because of this.  "You should step into my shoes and walk a mile then maybe you'll see how hard it is to hold back the tears and fake a smile."
-4	negative	emotional-health	Why do I feel so alone when I am near the people I love, I am trying to prove to myself that I am happy and deep down I am not. I just want everyone to feel what I'm not feeling and that is pure happiness. I don't want to sound like a debbie downer because my entire life isn't horrible and i don't want to sound selfish and say i don't like my life because people out somewhere else in the world have it worst than I ever will i just want to vent, I just want to be happy and i should be i deserve it everyone does!
-5	negative	emotional-health	Why is it soooo easy for my husband to sleep after we've had an emotional, argumentative day and yet I'm wide awake for the third night in a row? He's just snoring away. He fell asleep after a somewhat awkward conversation in which we were supposed to be working some things out. Seriously?! I'm glad it's so easy for him. Meanwhile, I'll just be stressing and upset into the wee hours of the night. Don't mind me. Don't let me furious typing bother you.oh, it's not phasing you? Big surprise. Ugh!
-2	negative	emotional-health	Will I ever find someone that will accept me, flaws and all? Will i ever find someone that needs me just as much as i need them? I'm lonely and my heart is full of love to give but will I ever find the right one to pour it all into? I don't know
-5	negative	emotional-health	With every word, you make me melt. With every laugh, you make me smile. With every tear, you make me cry. With every story, you open my mind. With every bold step towards health and life, you make my demons die a little more. Never change unless you want to.
-2	negative	emotional-health	With midterm exams and having to make a decision on which college to attend in the fall, I'm so stressed it's taking all I have to not to just cry and give up.
-6	negative	emotional-health	Without a doubt, I am.  I know exactly how to stop letting myself get used, it's easy, just don't go out alone to parties where I don't know anyone.  If i'm at a party with friends, nothing happens. It's not even that they have to stop anything from happening, I'm simply a different person, I'm always in control, and can easily say no or stop to anything that get's out of line.. and yet I keep going to the other parties, thinking "oh, i won't let things go to far" but every time, i let it happen again, it's not that I want to go along with things, I just can't stop them from happening.. I'm my own worst enemy because I keep putting myself in these positions, where time after time I have let things go further than I should. 
-2	negative	emotional-health	Worrying can be one of the hardest things to deal with! We still worry even though it changes nothing. In fact it makes things worse.  Worrying becomes so tiring and I'm tired of worrying. I deserve to be happy and smile and I AM. I hope that you can too.
-9	negative	emotional-health	Yeah I feel like I do. The other day I went to the movies by myself and then I went to go eat by myself at a restaurant. It was weird because I would look on the other side and it's just empty. It's kinda sad that I really have no one to talk to. I spend a lot of time in my room thinking about stuff that's going through my mind. I just hope I get to meet people that will be friends with me.
-2	negative	emotional-health	Yea. Not to sound like some kind of stalker or something, but now that I've looked or seen into peoples " I'm new to EP" posts I've come to the idea that my " I'm new to EP" isn't really desc #ifeelstupid #iknowitsnottwitter
-12	negative	emotional-health	Yep this is a big one. And very difficult. I believe people in general like to think they have a certain amount of control over things in life. Well, in my personal experience, it doesn't seem so true lol. I've worked hard my entire life, always tried to do right by everyone, never tried to cause harm or negativity, yet my life is just riddled with it. I've been knocked down from every accomplishment, had every happiness taken away so here I sit. Trying to accept the things I cannot change. The unfortunate events in life that have gotten me to this point the lowest point of my life. Fighting for survival everyday with everything I have left in me. Yay for the Serenity Prayer; a constant reminder of reality. I believe everyone can find an inner peace a contentment with life. And that's what I'm trying to do. Accept the unacceptable. &lt;3
-5	negative	emotional-health	Yes I may seem to be sad all the time. But trust me I can also be one of the happiest person. I do appreciate everything I have and get. I also love making others happy (: smiling is something I'm pretty good at doing! But it just those bad days that get to me the most 
-8	negative	emotional-health	yes it's Xmas, I have my family, a roof over my head and all the food and drink I need. But the man I loved for 3 years, the man I stood by through every storm, through every issue cheated. I found him out through his guilty conscious. he ruined my Xmas, he ruined my whole year. Broken hearted.
-6	negative	emotional-health	Yesterday i was thinking i would really really quit this time,I planned to text him in the morning not to come today. Hmmm did I say I wanted to quit? lol I think I just needed very tight long hug
-1	negative	emotional-health	You can actually feel it. You can actually tell and feel when youre starting to fade away from someone. The conversations get shorter, they get less meaningful, less exciting. You can feel the wall thats coming up between you two. And then in the end, youre back to being strangers.
-2	negative	emotional-health	You can only be yourself. You have to learn to with it - accept yourself for who you are hun cause you're one of a kind and that's why people love ya. xoxo
-7	negative	emotional-health	You guys say what you want, I know what I did and didn't do. *sighs* but since i have guy friends in real life I'm supposedly sleeping with them . Not true but whatever.  But it's okay I'll give up for you so you can get your wish.
-9	negative	emotional-health	You have to be atleast decent looking but I value personality more than looks. Looks can only get you but so far. Personality alone can make someone look better than their looks alone. A real relationship between two people will thrive if both are drawn to who eachother is more than what they look like on the outside. An ugly personality can make a good looking person ugly.
-2	negative	emotional-health	You have to smile reallllly big and say  When someone ask you what's wrong. Eventually they'll stop asking.
-8	negative	emotional-health	You want to sleep because sleep detaches you from the world. However the moments between wakefulness and sleep are the loneliest. The lights are off so its dark. The tv is off so there is silence. This allows your mind to wander. You think of every negative possibility. What used to be monsters under the bed, turns into thoughts about not living anymore. Ghosts around corners are instead thoughts of loneliness. This is when the tears start. You cry until the sleep comes. You cry until it can take you away just for a while. Then you wake up, and remember you were crying. Mascara under your eyes. You remember it. You remember when you really don't want to.
-3	negative	health Confessions	1.cut off my hair. This was an act jay coulent believe that a woman would do something like that and be duped. 2. Cut myself once on video for him. Again didnt want to " if you loved me youd" 3. This guy is homocidal and tryong to make me into something im not. Im gonna have to call toronto pd. They know him w ell. friends Confessions
-6	negative	health Confessions	 i just wanted to sit there and talk to you about the stupid * that's going on. talk and let it all out. it feels like its been so long since ive seen you or spoken to you. its harder than imagined, to completely open up to someone then have to leave with the faith that they will keep you in memory the way you know i always will. its so hard to walk past andhave to look the other way. its so hard to not be able to talk to you anymore. mostly its so hard knowing that somehow, i could easily turn it around on myself and make myself feel like i pretty much pushed you awayi really wish that i could still talk to you. even occasionally maybe, but i wish i still could
-7	negative	health Confessions	1. My cousin and I went into the woods before and kissed him full on his lips. 2.  My friend Devin and me played "show yours I show you mine" when we were kids. 3. I've drank alcohol , done tried cigs and I've used sniff.
-1	negative	health Confessions	24 hours without hearing another person's voice, I think it would be life-changing. Maybe I just need to get drunk.
-4	negative	health Confessions	2 years ago i convinced my best friend that my mom died when i was 4 and that the woman she has met is my godmom. it was a huge lie but i dont feel bad at all and want it to actually be true. i hate my mother. i love her for raising me but she was a horrible person and still is. i cant forgive her ever
-9	negative	health Confessions	3 months ago a guy asked me out. He was not at all the kind of guy that I wanted. I knew that it would be a terrible idea to go out with him. But I did. Now I am crazy in love with him. I have pretty much kept him a secret from everyone else in my life, because he doesn't match their description of the man I should be with. But it doesn't matter because in 2 days I am leaving to go to India for 3 months and he is going to move on with his life. =/
-1	negative	health Confessions	4500 e-mails. My inbox is completely empty and I am not sure how I feel about deleting them. I could not check my e-mail for a long time so they added up and I just hope I did not delete anything important. I could never go through them all so hopefully anything important will come in a future e-mail again. My anxiety is still high at having deleted them all though -- I hope it will passso much for sitting and painfully going through 4500 e-mails, whats done is done now.
-8	negative	health Confessions	4 days ago my best friend committed suicide. No one knew he was depressed, no one knew he would ever do that to himself. He said he was going out shooting with his girlfriend, and that he wanted to borrow my new gun. We've been shooting before so I thought nothing of it.  Showed him how the new gun works and gave him a box of bullets. I would've never guessed his real motive, if only I would've known And it's all my fault.
-18	negative	health Confessions	About 8 years ago I took a bus down south to visit family. It was me and my grandmother. I was about 15 at the time. Me and my grandmother were not seated together. She was sitting in the front I was 5 seats behind her towards the back. I fell asleep and woke up to the man touching my leg. I thought I was just dreaming until his hands started to move up further and further. When I look back at the situation now, I know I should have said something or stopped him but I didn't. I just sat there frozen, trying not to cry. I cried the entire trip I told my mother but she blamed me and the skirt I was wearing I. And sometimes I think back wonder if maybe it was my fault because I just sat there and did nothing.Now I'm supposed to move and the cheapest way is to take the bus but I'm afraid to. Just the thought of getting back on a bus makes me break out into a cold sweat.

-1	negative	health Confessions	According to my horoscopes, tomorrow I should dye my hair and get physical therapy for back and knee problems? Weird.
-9	negative	health Confessions	A couple years ago I met this guy on xbox live. We started talking and he asked for a picture so I sent him a picture of someone else. We continued talking for several months and fell in love. I could never meet him because I'd been sending pictures of someone else. When he found out he was furious and said I was crazy. We haven't talked since. It's crazy to love someone you never met. It's crazy to lie.
-4	negative	health Confessions	A coward is someone who hides behind a fake name and a fake profile most of /all their time instead of facing the world. Those that have balls grab life by the horns and have true real friendships with those they can see and speak to face to face. Virtual "reality" can never substitute reality.but it is a good outlet for emotions that are destructive when kept inside.
-15	negative	health Confessions	actually all my friends are party goer and they ask me to come though , they even say come with us, so many girls in there,but i decline . i dont know why. im happy listening to old music even though my looks doesnt haha., and my friends are dating so manygirls they change girls weekly . but me my last real relationship is more than 2 years now . were still talking she even told me that she loves me.but the thing is shes married now and she has a kid . nxt year she told me that shes coming here and want to be with me for that time . </3
-4	negative	health Confessions	actually the vagi part goes back to it's place after a couple of months; some women are more elastic than others. It's a muscle, and with kegels you can get back in shape. And your body does not necessarily change for the worsemost women have stretch marks and cellulite without childbirth. If you have them then they might get worse.but there are women that never get them after childbirth, many in my family including my mom. If you do decide to get pregnant, get lots and lots of calcium!! Babies leech it from your bones and it takes 6 months for normal bone density to return after childbirth. Exercising often and eating well will keep you fit for life.
-3	negative	health Confessions	a employee of mine had an affair with my boyfriend so when i found out i gave her a really bad haircut with 10 bald spots in it
-8	negative	health Confessions	A friend of mine found a bunch of letters and pictures I had in a shoe box at my house and took them to class and passed them around. So I went to his house, got his skateboard outof his room, and redecorated it. I ripped the grip tape, Icoloredall over the deckwith sharpie, Iripped the stickers off of it, I took his skateboard completely apart and threw the truck bolts, theking pin, bearings, axelnut, the axel, the spacer, the bushing, the truck, the truck nuts, the riser, the wheels, all of that stuffout the window. I really don't care that it was an expensiveElement board and I really don't care if he gets mad at me. Maybe next time he'll learn to leave other peoples sh*t alone and mind his own business.
-15	negative	health Confessions	After 15 years of   and 4 wonderful children- I found out that the love and security that goes with building your future with someone can be shattered. I literally lost my best friend, my husband and my life that I helped him create and build. I was lost.. I was sick.. I was shattered. And founding out it was for the bottle and another woman was just a huge stab.. This was not all that long ago but I did however meet a wonderful man-- who cares, cherishes and loves me and the kids without hesitation. I recently found out that my X has since kicked this woman that he had his "fling" with out.. and my confession is this: I laughed.. I cried.. I laughed again.. and pretty much don't feel any pain for the man.
-1	negative	health Confessions	After 20 plus years of   i cheated on my husband with another woman
-17	negative	health Confessions	After being together over two years i'm not sure what to do.I love and care very deeply for this man but the way he has been making me feel and acting toward me it makes me question why we are together.I have never felt this way and want to do whatever it takes me makes us better and get us back to the way we were but i don't know how or what's going on in his mind.I ask him and i never really get a response.I wonder if he is staying with me because we have a beautiful child or some other reason.I have asked him if he wanted to go to counseling and just laughed at me.I dont know.Jusy wish i had the answers.
-1	negative	health Confessions	After bending backwards for a long time, don't expect me to care all of a sudden, i justcan't lift a finger for you anymore.
-9	negative	health Confessions	After three and a half years together, it has all ended, so suddenly. He lied to me. He cheated on me. He dumped me. All of these things he has done and I can only think of the good times. How much I loved him. Why is his voice the only thing I want to hear? How could he pretend like I never existed? Why is it so hard to wake up in the morning without falling apart?
-4	negative	health Confessions	After tomorrow, I may never see someone again. As long as I've known them, I've wanted a special connection. Something they've never had with anyone else. I often wonder if they want the same. I don't exactly remember what a crush feels like, but whatever this is, it's powerful. Whenever I look at them, I can't think straight. My heart pounds. Hard. When they look at me, I have a difficult time looking away. I can feel a connection. I can feel their emotions. Love. Confusion. Pain. I want them to know how I feel about them. But they've been hurt in the past and I don't want to mess things up. Tomorrow may be my last chance. They leave for college soon. I can't stand being so far away from them. I REALLY REALLY like them. <3
-2	negative	health Confessions	After years of unhappy   I have come out as a gay man. Life looks fabulous!!!
-13	negative	health Confessions	After you throw yourself at a man after he threw himself at you only to be rejected. Waited to give myself to someone that I felt a special connection with, but I want to be committed. I wanted that with you but my mind is still trying to piece it all together.at least I am not upset anymore or thinking about it too much. I remind myself that not everything has an answer and sometimes people don't give a Fck about you. Guess that applies to you. Still I wonder what it would have felt likeall that tension building, wow what a release.incredible would probably be one word. No way either of us would have been disappointed. Doesn't matter now you rejected me for the last time.
-7	negative	health Confessions	a futile exercise if one does not want to talk to you. Tell me what is the point if someone has made it clear as day that they have written you off their list. Let me have my fantasy, delusion, dream, whatever you want to call it.. but stop telling me to contact you, for heavens sake! You have been done with this soul a long time ago so please stop playing games with them. I think I will come to my senses one day. Please allow me to grieve. It might take a decade or a lifetime, but give me the chance to be myself on EP. Go live your own life instead of telling others what to do!

-21	negative	health Confessions	A group I regularly attend was mentioned on facebook- everyone except me was mentioned in the post.I am trying not to take it personally, but however hard I try there is always the thought that perhaps it wasnt an accident after all.Lets face it, Im not the top choice of friend.Im not the popular one or the rich one. Im "kind but boring" at least that's what I guess people think of me.I really have no idea. Maybe I dont even get thought about..I mean, it seems that Im always on the outside looking in, that Im not really needed or wanted. I attend the group because I enjoy it, but I honestly dont think anyone there would miss me if I didnt go at all.I hope I dont make others uncomfortable, Im better at listening than talking but I am friendly.I think Im just boring with not much to offer.sometimes I think I should just stay in.but why should I give up something I enjoy just because Im not really "included"?

-6	negative	health Confessions	A little over a week ago I signed a lease on a new place, hence beginning my separation. I move in a few days. This is the end of my marriage and the beginning of somethingthat I cannot even begin to imagine. We were together for 15 years. Wow, I never thought I would be single again. It's both scary and exciting. I don't know which of these two sentiments will be upheld. But I have a chance to make something out of it, don't I. I am very concerned about my now ex-wife who was in a bad place but for the last few days has seemed o.k. I hope that this continues and she doesn't coming crashing down. I still care very much about her. I wish I could do more to make her alrightbut..I don't know what I am supposed to do.
-3	negative	health Confessions	all day. Guess it's the peasant blouse. But there's only one person I want to love my breasts and hold and kiss them.
-1	negative	health Confessions	All I ever wanted is your listening ear, and not your arguments. What I want is for us to sit down together and talk, share, about our life, about our children's life, how we will plan our tomorrow. But unfortunately, it all ends up in fights and struggles - each one trying to outweigh the other. All this is so exhausting for me. I would rather just keep quiet. This leaves me all alone, trying to figure it all out on my own, making my own decisions and right now I really do not know what to do. I need someone to talk to. I do not know who will sit down and listen to me and help me find which path to go, if it is not you. I am tired of all this arguing.
-10	negative	health Confessions	All I had to do, was be honest and say I love her.  and there, my best friend turned traitor and left. Its been 6 weeks since we split, 2 weeks into that, 4 weeks ago, I tried to fix the friendship, but she wouldnt listen. I stil think about her. Everyday, every night. I feel so betrayed but I'll stil welcome here back if she ever decides to forgive me. It hurts to be without her. friends Confessions

-13	negative	health Confessions	All of my friends are married and they don't like to go out and do anything. Movies? Nope. Dinner? Nope. It really sucks, So I decided to broaden my friendship base and try something new, I joined a group and have been to a couple of events and had a blast. Friday night I met a really great guy and we continued the fun after the event was over. We ended up kissing and there was some serious chemistry. He text me on his way home, before I crashed, and later in the afternoon. Then nothing. And then I noticed he joined one of the singles groups I'm in He didn't text or call me.I feel like a complete fool! I'm no idiotI do realize we just met. I also know the book he's not that into you. Men that don't call are not interested. He really peaked my interest.I feel so stupid!!!!

Sick and angry, sad stuffing my face to feel full, the wrong way. I miss the man i really love and will never see again. I miss the man who loves me and I know I must spend the rest of my life with but can't be home right now. I am stupid emotional and did something so destructive for no good reason. I ate and ate until I felt sick. Then out came some of it. I hate what I did. I hate the feelings I feel right now. I am so damaged and now I must face that. friends Confessions

They even asked if we Had  And i had to tell them that I don't have  with polar bears. Sorry was the first thing came in my mind
-3	negative	health Confessions	A lot of people say, "You don't need a boyfriend, they are only going to hurt you..blah blah blah"But I think loving someone is what keeps us alive--content. It might hurt us, but it makes us feel like we are human.

-5	negative	health Confessions	am sick of being sick. I've got some chronic conditions that while not life threatening, make me feel tired, sore, run down a bit like having the flu on a regular basis. I have declined quite a bit this year with stomach problems and fatigue. I feel sick to my stomach from almost everything I eat, not sure why.  I have IBS but have never had it quite like this.  I almost think I may have acquired a bunch of food allergies to foods I had no problem eating before. I have sinus congestion in my head/throat with it in addition to a handful of other problems like asthma . It could be worse so I don't like complaining, just wish I felt better.

Create your character, defines your skills and start your journey into a gigantic galaxy of 1,000,000 systems.yes talking of space systems.about 3600 active players ( before it was 4000 but dropped a lot with the last year ). so we need a lot of players to come here and play. the game exists since 1999 and always was free. the game has so much evolved, i guarantee its the nearest star wars experience ever ( even more than SWTOR which is kinda fantasy-like ).swcombine(dot)com

-3	negative	health Confessions	And I also have a violent temper. I used to do kickboxing and that really helped me vent, but my temper got worse after that,
-6	negative	health Confessions	and I always thought it corny and cheesy and pathetic until I amactually in this situation now. I'm living with my boyfriend of 10 years now and he is in a relationship with a great girl. But these obstacles doesn't stop my heart from feeling this way. And I'm beginning to hate myself for being weak and not being able to ignore this feeling. I tried to stay away from him and I was proud of myself for being able to turn him down when he asked me out for dinner last week. But seeing him again today after a week proved that my heart is as stubborn as my head. What could I do? If I don't see him, I would miss him and when I finally see him, the feelings would come rushing in and overwhelm me. If I see him everyday, the feeling slowly builds until my happiness depends on being with him. friends Confessions
-9	negative	health Confessions	 and I am working hard. Yet never hard enough nor fast enough, to relinquish the anger and hatred you hold for me. Never have I worked soo hard at something which destroys my heart for anyone else, but myself.. until now. I only wish you could read my soul my every intention. Only then would ever you know. that things were never as dark as they had seemed, once ..then whence you looked at me.Everything could collapse around me, and a single word from you would send me peacefully home, to you.Though we live in two different worlds, I've traversed dimensions for you.I've never regretted all the battles lost in effortand I'd do it all again.

-3	negative	health Confessions	and if you think I am indifferent, i need to explain something. IF you are the person I know then you know the situation. What I can't put to words is being overwhelms with missing you and loving you is difficult, very difficult at times. I'm almost going under, it seems..so I distract myself.I let something catch my eye so the build up of emotion doesn't reach fever pitch so to speak.if this doesn't apply to the confession perhaps your person is like this
-9	negative	health Confessions	and I hate him too. I have often wished I never knew the SOB (he never my mother anyway, has never married any woman) or his little **. He is still a drug addict at age 62, and his brat is a druggy too! He claims he never did more for her than my brother and me, but it's not true. His mother always preferred her because she was mostly white (my father being half-white himself, and her mother being wholly white). A lot of mixed people, especially those that are half white, are snooty and think they are better than people who are black. I have gotten so that I detest mixed race people, which is bad because I look biracial myself and am often mistaken for being so. Basically, I have become more of a misanthrope than I was as a teenager and I don't want to change right now.
-2	negative	health Confessions	And I just want to scream from the bottom of my lungs!! Scream until this feeling of emptiness and frustration disappears. :-(
-8	negative	health Confessions	And, in a way, like me, years of feelings etcone thought to be null.suddenly make their presence known.   Turned up side down, inside out.  Its very hard.   LIive your life to the best of your ability for His will.   Lean (He means it) on Him.More clearly you'll see his will. being close to God & open that mind you gotta grow.  You are more wise than you realize and need to decide for yourself what you feel called to do. I love you and I'm here to help with love.

Ive sunken so deep I can't force myself out of bed. The house is a terrible mess, a direct expression of how I'm feeling inside. I WANT TO HAVE A LIFE! I want to enjoy it, not just struggle and barely get by. I want to get myself together, get this same guy out of my life! I've realized I've dated the same guy over and over for the last 20 years only with a different face! The answers not there! God PLEASE help me pick myself up and get it together, and help me to help myself! I want to enjoy some of this time before I am no more. I want to live, not just exist!
-7	negative	health Confessions	.. and I so let you go. But it was best for you couldn't leave her alone! But I still miss our endless talks and fun we had and pool playing and just random things we would do and I always had so much fun with you!  I am missing you tonight.. Last night I went out and was so bored with my bf that I began talking to anyone and everyone to help my situation. And I thought of you many times. God how it would be so great to hold heaven in my arms again. I am not happy. I know you wonder that sometimes. And no.. I am not. I wish we didn't have such a big age difference for I know it held us both back.  I still wish I had you though. You were awesome to be with.
-8	negative	health Confessions	.And it coincides with my heart of hopes. I wonder when the day will come when our barriers, barricades, and boundaries are broken down, so we may beseech our blossoming ballad of love . Our bashful blunders billow our borrowed time. We brainstorm bittersweet routes, for this forbidden abundance of romance. A boundless connection breaching our budding union. Bouts bend our brains, suffocating our broken chests, branding our beautiful souls, bumping ceaselessly into the black abyss we label our past. Bid those bloody bouts farewell, so we can bound these bulging hearts of ours. Once and for all.
-5	negative	health Confessions	and it worked. except. my husband says "I don't think you're faking as much as you think you are, I think you DO have a touch of ADHD." But I don't know. I think I just lack discipline. Anyway. I don't care. I had an Adderall scrip in hand by my second visit to a psych and have lost about 7lbs (I was not overweight or anything beforehand, I was at a definite stasis so 7 lbs is EXCELLENT for me). friends Confessions

-5	negative	health Confessions	And my friend asks me why I'm so down and I'm too ashamed to tell her there isn't really a concrete answer to her question. I wish I could just get her to understand that I'm just in a bad place in my mind and I don't know how to get out of it. I'm trying so hard to keep it hidden, but I feel like I've been doing it for so long, I don't have strength to anymore. Probably why I feel like I cry all the time now.

-1	negative	health Confessions	Anonymous. Good one. I'll have to remember that. funny Confessions
-20	negative	health Confessions	Another sad thing about what she's doing is that while she's "saving" this guy's marriage, she's wasting time she could be spending finding a husband of her own. What a horrible sacrifice to make for such a sleazy situation. Time passes faster than young people realize, and if she doesn't get serious about building a future, she's going to wake up one day and realize that she's alone and likely to remain that way. Even if she manages to marry at say, 40, she's wasted 15-20 years she could have spent with one person. A relationship started at 40 doesn't have the same history or intimacy as a relationship begun in your 20s. The couple have already missed so much of each other's lives and there's no way to make up for that. And she's giving this up for some guy who can't keep his pants zipped and who DOES NOT CARE what his fun costs anyone else. It's sad and disgusting.

-2	negative	health Confessions	As a child I used to like the taste of medicine and would go to the fridge and sneak some, drinking it in mouth-fulls while no-one was there to see.
-11	negative	health Confessions	As a general rule, people usually are drawn to people who listen to them and pay attention to them. It sounds like he isn't hearing you or trying to and you feel the relationship is off which makes sense. If he loves you for you, he should want to learn about you. If the discussion always seems to circle back to him, then it seems he loves that you listen and pay attention to him. It seems like your situation is about him not you.
-4	negative	health Confessions	as each day passes, it gets easier and easier to let you go. i can imagine you without me, falling in love all over again, starting a family with someone else. i can imagine you happy with that someone, growing old together, holding its hand all the things i once dreamed about with you. the reality is, they belonged to someone else. </3
-1	negative	health Confessions	Aside from family, I don't talk to anyone any more.
-2	negative	health Confessions	ASKED ME TO DATE HIM! And I couldn't be more happier.This has been 3 years coming. So ladies, if he thinks you're worth it: stay.

-2	negative	health Confessions	As much as I appreciate things being nicely sorted and in the proper place,as much as I'm willing and eager to learn how to organize my home, my life my timeas much as I admire people who follow structured, systematic and optimized action plans,l don't think I'll ever be perfectly orderly, methodical and efficient.
-8	negative	health Confessions	As much as I hate to admit this, I've noticed that I am at my creative best when  feeling depressed. My best short stories, songs, poems, jokes, critiques, essays, and witticisms all emerge whenever I am in a state of extreme emotional turmoil. The antithesis to this is that whenever I am feeling happy, I have no creativity. I struggle with even the simplest of tasks, which sends me right back into limbo. I have already seen several psychologists, and they all agree that there is nothing particularly wrong with me, and I outright refuse to take medication to even out my moods. This Faustian bargain, choosing happiness or creativity, is driving me to the Cliffs of Insanity (with neither rope, nor herculean Fezzik to help me conquer the indomitable heights). No wonder Kurt Cobain took a shotgun to the face.
-6	negative	health Confessions	as much as i   my mom and hated my dad for cheating on her, i still wish my mom would have the heart to forgive him. it's been 6 years since my dad left. im 28 years old now and about to get married. and up to know, i cry secretly from my mom and wish my dad would be able to walk me down the aisle on my wedding day. we don't even know where he is as of the moment. i just know that on the day he left, he said he was sorry but neither my mom nor i would accept his apology. i want to tell him now that i forgave him already. i just hope my mom would too.
-2	negative	health Confessions	As my life continues spiraling downward, Into this never-ending abyss, I begin to contemplate. Where am I going? When will I hit bottom, because it is sure to come As I continue spiraling down in this dark, black abyss I begin to lose myself. I begin to disconnect from reality. From all that is seen and unseen. My body begins to dismember itself. I scramble to collect all the pieces. Its too late. They are forever gone. As am I. friends Confessions

Telling me you still cared about her but not in that way anymore. At first It didn't phase me.. But now it's all just getting to me.. I want to walk away from you now. But you just won't let me go. God I pray there has to be some easy way for this to end.

-1	negative	health Confessions	Because I made my wife cry on accidentI beat myself with a bamboo stick.I'm disappointed I don't have any bruises now, I need to be hit harder next time.It's not right that I should not pay for what I am and what I've done.
-9	negative	health Confessions	Because I'm sure you would've been able to tell I had being crying all night. I waited till you left for work to open my eyes. I was crying next to you in bed while you slept because you don't seem to want to show me any affection anymore. I cried looking at the woman I fell in love with, wishing I knew that she loves me back.
-3	negative	health Confessions	because one is married it does not mean they have a perfect love. Being in a loveless marriage is like you are already dead. We have feelings, needs and desires. Sometimes we can give it our 100% but it feels like something is missing.
-5	negative	health Confessions	because you made me so happy.  that's all.  i used to be so comfortable being myself around you.  the only other person i've ever been so comfortable with is my best friend.  i miss you. i was looking so very forward to seeing you again but you left me.
-4	negative	health Confessions	been trying to reach me & haven't been able to. You should know it's intentional. You proved yourself untrustworthy, selfish, cruel, abusive, & emotionally bankrupt. Yes, Im avoiding you. You're the plague. You're not even human to me. So I just thought you should know yes it's true I don't answer your texts & even told you to stop contacting me because I know you are the lowest of the low. Your energies are wasted trying to keep up the act. I saw through your veneer last summer and won't ever change my mind about that.
-2	negative	health Confessions	Before you say but you are anon hypocritewell I just don't care. I am leaving ep. nothing for me here.
-6	negative	health Confessions	Being alone and single is so much better than being with the wrong person. After talking to people who are unhappy in relationships, marriages and after reading the confession yesterday about the Stepford Wife, I can't express how happy I am that I am not in that situation. I may be alone, but at least no one else is controlling my every move and I am available to hopefully one day find the right person.
-9	negative	health Confessions	Being alone sucks, I can barely stand looking at other couples. The thing that bothers me most is my roommate, she and her boyfriend are always so cute with each other. He buys her flowers all the time, the go out on walkstogether, they take cute pictures and for some reason the put it on the wall. I haven't actually told them I don't like it, i mean there in love, I don't want to be abuzz kill. It's just that their kissing and hugging all the time and it just makes me feel so, so lonely, sadbasicallyi feel like i'm going to implode. I don't want to be the third wheel, I guess I just feel overlooked that's all.It's not like anyone. ever pays any attention to me. I'm pretty sure I'm one of the few girls that actually getsfriendzoned. Howpathetic is that
-2	negative	health Confessions	Being sick succccccccks! Why do we have to be sick? What's the point of it?
-12	negative	health Confessions	Better to put all your faith in yourself and the people who love and care about you.    Religion is a diversion from this focus so that you will remain more "control-able".   I find it best to be as authentic a person as possible to yourself and those in your world. Life is full of ups and downs it is how you react is what counts.  Being a good person does not mean life is all rainbows and unicorns.   In fact, it takes more courage than most are capable of to remain on a straight path.  All I know is I feel like an alien here.

I dunno.I need people to SEE that I am trying my best.
-7	negative	health Confessions	Blah, I feel so inadequate as a grad student in theoretical physics. Maybe I'm just not good enough. The literature is so vast and huge and I still haven't published a paper yet. It's Saturday and I should be working and not bumming around on the internet. Why does it matter anyway, it's unlikely I'll ever discover something significant. What am I doing with my life?Well it could be worse, at least I'm pursuing something that I "love". I can't give up, I have to try and try again until maybe when my advisor gives up on me.

-8	negative	health Confessions	Brandon, you treat me like crap. You call me ugly, and say i have no friends. Long ago, we were such good friends. I told you my family problems and sometimes you comforted me. I miss you. But, you hate me. Now my self esteem is so low. I feel ugly standing next to her. You hugged me and i wanted to cry. I wanted to cry becausei am HEAD OVER HEALS in L O V E with you. . . and if you felt the same way it would be an absolute dream come true. but you have no idea.
-3	negative	health Confessions	Broke his heart a few days ago. So it seems like he's turned off his phone and isn't getting into contact with anyone. Didn't realise he'd fall for me so hard. I told him I was trouble, that I had nothing but issues. I'm 'crazy', you don't want crazy.He just couldn't see it. He said "crazy is relative" and just couldn't see any faults. Said I'm smart, funny and attractive, what more could anyone want. It would've been deceptive to pretend to be interested in him.I can't help it, I'm so numb on the inside I feel nothing for anyone or anything. I haven't been truly happy in 4 years. I miss what we had so much, but you've changed, and I've changed, and it'll never be the same. I just wish I could have that happiness just for a few minutes again.I guess I'm sorry for breaking his heart, but it's not my fault. I TOLD HIM I am physically incapable of having feelings for anyone or anything now. He just couldn't understand and kept trying to force me to like him.
-3	negative	health Confessions	But a lot of people seem happy to schit on someone else's doorstep.. be wary of those out of towners. They may talk the talk, but do they walk the walk? Maybe it's best to stick to the local yokels?
-4	negative	health Confessions	But at a certain point, you just rise above them. They don't matter. You learn to actually feel sorry for them and the misery that causes them to behave the way they do. These days, they're more pathetic than threatening to me.
-10	negative	health Confessions	but beause of the standards i carry 4 my self and my spouse i wouldnt have it any other way but too be respected and it given in return and to be loved as i am and respected took work and what im not going to putt up with and will exept lifes short and painful sometimes butt the thang about it is never give up god grace is somthing and indures 4 ever..i like too say this is my season im worth more than a side item if i wasnt married or not as a women and i desrve just as well as the man i married to be loved and respected and never be just an option thats me and always will be .. night ep

-2	negative	health Confessions	But if we ever came face to face, id say nothing.
-15	negative	health Confessions	But I get a bad, bad vibe from our neighbor, especially in the past two days. He gives me the creeps. No results are free for background information on this dude, but he's up to no, no, no good. I'm sure of it. All he does all day is pace around his house. When I go outside, he sits down. He's done this more recently in the past year. He first moved in here two years ago next month or something. That was after my mum and I were being followed by two black men from the post office. Then my brother and I saw a man standing in the street in the middle of the night, just watching us. And I go outside and see our neighbor behind us (the one that gives me the chilly willies) walking down our street, watching me take out my dog to go bathroom for the night. He smiles at me all the time when I'm out there. In the last two days, though, he has waved at me, smiled, talked, and sat down just to watch me. I'm scared. :'(
-16	negative	health Confessions	but i guess i'll confess it anyways. i know that people come into our lives for a reason, and that we're never really going to know exactly why. but i still can't help questioning, why YOU? why are you the guy that came and went and now seems to be coming back? why are you able to mess with my head the way that you have been? it's crazy how one minute there's this person that you see, maybe you know them, but you don't have any connection with them. then the next minute, they've made an imprint on who you are. it's driving me crazy. why you? aren't you just the random guy that i know through some friends? no, you're not. you're the guy that pulled me out of my bored rut, you're the guy i lost my virginity to, you're the guy that really hurt me for the very first time. and whether you know it or not and whether you like it or not, i'm going to remember your name for those things. when did you become this person in my life?
-10	negative	health Confessions	But I have to let it go. You are a good person. This is the wrong way to communicate effectively. I am having trouble forgetting all of the things that went awry. I am sad about this. I wish we could go back to the green. There are so many things I wish I would have done differently. Do you know that? I wonder what you really think. You made me happy, but I haven't seen you in centuries. Maybe that's why I feel hazy.
-1	negative	health Confessions	But I really do   you. With every part of me.. I love you so much.
-2	negative	health Confessions	but it's easier to live with than the things I used to feel.

-1	negative	health Confessions	But loving someone, and being loved means so much to me. We always make fun of it and stuff. But isn't everything we do in life a way to be loved a little more?
-7	negative	health Confessions	but no I'm serous this time, I'm thinking about avoiding this site or any websites. I just need to take a walk at night and think about what should I do to draw myself closer to God. taking easy steps first is more like fasting to the next level. I'm just enjoying my last time beforeif I have a strong that God wants me to break my addictions to websites.My dream goal is to draw and stay close to God, God loves me and he loves you all.I gotta go, goodnight pickle and JB, it was fun. friends Confessions

-4	negative	health Confessions	But the, um'life lesson people' in my life are all cracked out if they think they should be giving life lessons. They're just as bad as I am. Especially the kid who started it. Everyone elsewho the hell goes along with something like that????The people I should've been listening to are my friends who are currently convinced I should be in a mental hospital. Because they can't believe anyone would actually do this to someone else. Butyeah, no. I don't believe in getting people arrested forwhatever this is.
-5	negative	health Confessions	but the way I'm treated here is about to drive me over the edge. I'm mistreated, maligned, and bad mouthed at every opportunity, because I'm different. Now I'm told that by doing my job at my part time police job I'm endangering working full time here. The way people act in this center toward others is horrible. In all my years, I've never even imagined that a few people could make someone feel so badly. It's like high school bullying on an adult scale.
-1	negative	health Confessions	but we did   at you and you will never know how many times we posted for each other. he he he

-6	negative	health Confessions	Can someone please just hold me! I need to cry, it's all built up, i've carried everyone but they won't take the time to even look my way, let alone see the pain in my eyes. Everything is falling apart and I can't do this anymore. But I can't admit that to anyone. That's not me. To all my friends and family, i'm the strong one, the funny one, the tough one with the sassy comments. But when i'm alone, i'm a scared little girl who cries herself to sleep holding a pillow wishing it were a friend holding me back, smoothing my hair down and whispering that they love me and we'll go through this together. But none of you care, and how can I blame you when I know how I don't deserve that kind of treatment.
-12	negative	health Confessions	Can someone tell me how guys act after breaking up with you? Are they all cold? I find myself wondering if I ever even mattered to him. I wondered that at times during our relationship as well. I never felt like he loved me. It makes me sad that this is how people are treated after a break-up. I know I have done the same thingso maybe it's karma coming back to bite me. Who knows.

-16	negative	health Confessions	close my eyes and say a prayer. I ask for words that will draw my love for you, color it beautiful and give it life so as to step off the screen and embrace you. I ask for words to flow like the waters of a river and the breezes of summer.with warmth and flow right into your heart. This magical thing this beautiful golden thread that somehow has brought us together, I know is rare.So rare it is that the thought of not ever having you in my life literally sucks my breath out of my body. Instinctively I want to run and hold on and fight for what gives me hope.you. But, when I close my eyes and I feel this love I remember that it is in truth a gift. Suddenly I remember for the hundredth time today, all I need to do is walk the path I am supposed to and He will take care of everything else.

I was stunned.  What was I thinking?   Should have thrown what little you did have out in the lawn and burned it.  But I didn't did I?  What kind of man does such things?   I was so blind.

You seriously have nothing better to do than to think of outrageous reasons why someone would want to be friend you. I needed a friend too, and not someone who was so determined to look for ulterior motives. Get over yourself!

-7	negative	health Confessions	Days where I'm really feeling down I find myself wishing for someone to come in to my life.. give a smile, say "hello", someone who can take me away from all the sadness that has accumulated over the years. I just want someone loyal and honest and I will love him forever faithfully and unconditionally."True love" is so rare now, every couple I know of has at least one person cheat on the other. I don't understand people sometimes, how they could betray somebody who loves them very much. They throw in so many excuses but it will never make sense to me.It would be nice to be able to trust another with my heart again.

-3	negative	health Confessions	Dear m. I wonder what you are really like. If the fantasy is anything like the reality. The fantasy is not flattering though, so I guess the only place to go from there is up.
-6	negative	health Confessions	Dear my  , how I wanted you to be here with me. Sweet darlin', only you can can save me from my  haunted  memories. I can't keep pretending that I have fallen in love with you and I can only  wish that you will be forever mine. I want to give you all my love that is left in this heart of mine. I want to walk with you in our land of fantasy. I want to  watch your sweet face in early morning light and feel your sweet embrace at night.
-8	negative	health Confessions	Deep in your soul you know each and every act of harm you intended upon me most of which you thought would go unnoticed by all but me.   While that may be true I must inform your that funs over.  I am asking the universe for justice so I can finally go back to believing that this world will give me what I deserve instead of believing that joy only belongs to those who wear a mask.  I do not wish you any harm, not a all. I only wish for you to walk in my footsteps for every tear you knew I would give you. None of which did I ever expect or deserve by the way.

-7	negative	health Confessions	Disgusting  . My armpits smell like onions. Sucks! Even if take a bath daily, especially when I sweat a lot, oh my God, I hold my breath sometimes not to smell my armpit. I do not know what is causing this smell. When I shave my armpit, the strong odor comes out if I sweat. They said, I just have to drink a lot of water, apply some lemon. Ya, of course hydration. The lemon works though, but I can't remember to put them most of the time. But I'm just wondering why do some people who have underarm odor pretends as if they didn't smell that infact they smell like rotten fruit. If I  myself knows that I'm smelling and I'm very uncomfortable with it specially when I'm dressed up and with my friends. It's so embarrassing really! How can I get rid of this rusty smell I do not know.

-2	negative	health Confessions	Especially when a man sees a nak*d woman.. in movies, magazines etc.. The idea of ** clubs make me sick to my stomach.Something happened to me when I was younger that now makes me feel this way.. Fortunately it has not actually affected my s*x life in any other way. But when I see s*x scenes I feel like throwing up, I get major anxiety and sometimes even cry.I am most uncomfortable with my significant other watching s*x scenes..it literally makes me sick to my stomach. But even a conversation at work about a movie that has explicit s*x scenes makes me feel the same way.I wish I didn't have to think about this.. I wish it wasn't engraved in my mind. It's a wonder how things can stick with you even for over ten years.Does anyone else go through this???
-17	negative	health Confessions	even though i hurt him so bad by violating his trust . i hurt him so bad. Yet I am still in love with him.when we first went out, i wasnt in love with him. We broke up a couple of times but I went back with him because i kept thinking about him. i was drawn to him. with time, i got to know him more, deeper and i fell in love. i fell in love with him. however, he constantly told me that i always put other things ahead of him like school work. so last year, he broke up with me. its been a year and six months and yet I still cant move on. i think about him every day and write poems to him all the time.. yet, he has started dating someone else now. the other day he told me that he still loved and that he always would I dont understand ..i guess i can never win back his trust and that is why we have not gotten back togetherthanks for reading and i just wanted to get this out on paper.

-3	negative	health Confessions	Even though she hurt me I never stopped missing my mom. All I ever wanted was to feel that she loved me. I don't miss her anymore. I still love her though.
-6	negative	health Confessions	Even when our feelings are the same and distance separates our love, right now that doesn't matter. Only our feelings for each other does. Love has no boundaries. If there is a will there is a way. My heart is pure as gold. No sorrow will ever hurt the one I love. Pretty soon we will be united again but until then our love is written down in sweet poetic verses. Until we wake up seeing the dawn, until we come over the mountains together. But now we whisper our thoughts to the wind, hoping they would reach each other's ears. Sweet memories last forever, sweet sorrow fades away  Replace happiness with the memories worth forgetting  You will never regret this distant love, my dear!  Until we meet again under the everlasting stars  and watch the coming dawn together! friends Confessions

Besides him wiping our joint checking account out, he also has a credit card that he's got cash advances on and bought 2 dollar pops at a time, (on the credit card!!)  I just recieved the statement.  He has put us in financial ruin.  What do I do??

-1	negative	health Confessions	Every day that passes I feel like I hate my husband. I don't like him touching me, everything he does annoys me. I dispise sleeping in the same bed. I feel like he is responsible for my day to day misery. I just want to scream and tell him that I want a divorce! But I can't bring myself to it, I dont know if I fear him or if I fear the consequences I just can't do it. I wish I never met him or married him. I don't wish him bad or death I just want to get away. I'm so weak from bring miserable, nothing stops me from being miserable, not alcohol not weed or meds. I'm in a constant state of saddness. I don't know why I feel like this, I just want it to go away! I'm frustrated and I don't care to be in an other relationship, I just want to find myself again. I'm losing my mind and my life in going downhill. I don't know if anything can change this feeling.
-15	negative	health Confessions	everyday, You come home. go on the computer in the room next to our bedroom. your in there all night, I can hear you laughing over skype and playing games with your friends. You stay up till 2 am, and dont ever spend time with me all day. You work, come home, go onto your computer, go to bed. some where inbetween there I get a few, "hi's" "I love you's" and kisses. or the occassional "im hungry make me food?" It doesnt always bug me, sometimes I dont care, But sometimes I just want you to spend time with me. instead of us being in seperate rooms all the time. I go into the computer room with my laptop until it dies. then Ill sit in the computer room until I get bored of watching you play games, or until im sick of hearing you scream over skype to your friends while you all play games. I love you and sometimes I get aggrivated we never spend time together, or do activities we both enjoy. -venting-

-3	negative	health Confessions	Everyone seems to have mental illness these days. At least everyone here does. You'd have to suffer from some sort of obsessive compulsive disorder to keep coming back here.
-11	negative	health Confessions	Everyone thinks I over react about it, but I really can't help it. I recently got diagnosed with anxiety & I was put on medication for it. Ever since I was a little girl I can remember worrying about things most people don't even think of. I've now become more of a hypochondriac than anything. I've told myself that I have had ovarian cancer, gential herpes, throat cancer, I believed I was going deaf, blindness etc. I obsessively wash my hands and try to take 2 showers a day. I feel like this is consuming my life. I try to stay off google, but i always fail. I usually google treatments and diseases, that only makes me freak out more.My parents try to tell me it's mind over matter, but my brain won't stop thinking about what if.

I lost a friend, and tho we do text and talk at times Idk its like a part of him shut off to me cuz I had to walk away from him and now as Im texting him I feel dead inside and hating myself so much that I keep playing with my swich blade wanting to cut myself a notch to make myself feel a little better and make this throbbing pain in my stomach and heart go away. Just a little blood is all it takes to make it go away for a little while.

-8	negative	health Confessions	Every timeI leave home and go out while he is there I come back to check what was hie doing on the internet (history). I feel ashamed and disgusted for doing this but I have a reason I want more attention from him. I have asked this for last 6 yrs. Since we got married I want him to look at me then privately looking at those dirty websites. Where will this take me? I always question myself. Should I leave him alone?
-11	negative	health Confessions	every timeit starts to bother me that he is leaving next month for basic, i hide it from him because i'm in fear that i'm being selfish. this is something that he really wants to do with his life, and here i am making it all about me. i am being supportive but i am in so much fear of drifting away from him when he is gone. i dont want to feel this way, but i always feel so guilty if he catches me crying, or sees that its worrying me that he'll be gone.

-14	negative	health Confessions	Feb 14 and 15th this yr have been painfull. The man I love has a wife whohe also loves. No Valentine this year cuz he was distracted with going into the hospital for a tumor on the 15th. I cannot go be beside him, or call to make sure he came out alright, or even ask anybody how it went, because I am not supposed to know. I have cleaned all the pictures in the house, the kitchen walls and still my chest hurts and the tears are flowing. I never figured I would get into a situation where I would fall in love with another woman's husbandas this happened to me as the wife so very long ago and it hurt like hell. He tells me every day he loves me too and we both know he will never leave her after more than 40 yrs of marriage. I do not feel doom, so I will take that as it went alright. But I cannot wait till he contacts me to say "Hi Sweetie" then I will feel better. A couple of dayz of this and my house will shine like a mirror everywhere. If I do not have a heart attack first.

-4	negative	health Confessions	Feede, fat does not make one curvy, it makes them fat. Curvy is a body type, larger b reast s, slender waist, little extra in the hips and rear, legs with slender muscles.

I live in NC and want to attend BYU-Provo in Utah but my father told me that he will not be helping with any of the costs and I understand because he really does not have any money. I love NC but my dreams have been to go there.Gah what am I going to do?? I am so tired of living here, there is nothing for me only a ton of bad memories.

-2	negative	health Confessions	Fingers poised above the keys, thoughts roiling in my head, emotions churning in my heart, yet words somehow fail me. My fingers are frozen in the same state ofsuspenseas my heart and mind. I'm speechless, numb, and overwhelmed with a heaviness I can't seem to shake for long. I'm tired of fighting it, of denying it, of living it. Part of me needs to purge, to release the emotional pain. Part of me hesitates, wanting to hide from the shame and humiliation of putting it out there for others to witness. Part of me sees the pattern, and part of me closes her eyes to itignorantly clinging, hoping, wishing, praying, denying. 
-8	negative	health Confessions	First off I want to start this   with I love my husband more than anything in the world. But here goes my confession. I have been fantisizing and pondering being with someone else.  My husband means the world to me but lately he has been very distant. I think that he is depressed because he is working two jobs and even though we are getting caught up on our bills, it still seems as if we are broke all of the time.  My husband also has a hard time communicating due to a childhood of "if you have a problem keep it to yourself because i don't care from his parents" I know that my fantisies and thoughts are only because he is becoming distant, but I don't know what to do to help him and i am afraid if it keeps going i am going to do something i regret just out of lack of attention.
-1	negative	health Confessions	Fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, you are total scum, fool me three times, shame on me.
-6	negative	health Confessions	For example if I was waiting for a bus or in a long queue, I wish that nobody would think anything strange if I just got down and started knocking out some pushups or starting doing some jumping jacks. When I am at home and nobody else is around I do this. When I was in the Army people use to do this as well. I just want to see this norm be extended beyond these two settings. friends Confessions

-11	negative	health Confessions	for how many years im trying to move after we broke up, i dont know whats happening to you or to your life. but up to this time i feel the pain of loosing you. i've tried my best to live my life and after all this years im still hoping that when we see each other again there would be a space for me in your heart and in your life. but all this hope was shattered into pieces when i heared the news, you have a new born child, i dont know how i will react, the pain is too much, i dont have the right to be sad or to cry because im just a memory of your past.
-2	negative	health Confessions	For new year, i slept alone while my husband was in the other room.
-3	negative	health Confessions	For robbing me of my life. I hate you so very very much. You took so much away from me and I doubt you even know it. I lost everything.
-13	negative	health Confessions	For seven years I have been brutally bullied.I used to be beat up once a week by kids four years older than me. It was always because I was fat, ugly and nerdy. I don't eat any more, I don't like myself, I'm sick of pretending that I'm okay because I know that I'm not. Mum always says to me that I should just ignore them. That that's the best way to make them leave you alone. So far it hasn't really worked for me. I'm still ignored by most of the girls at school. I have three friends in total. My mother put me on Atkins. Everyone wants me to be perfect. I'm sick of pretending that I want to be perfect. I just want to be me.
-14	negative	health Confessions	For some of the same reasons as another person on this site, I have been labeled standoffish, too. My husb says he thinks because I am so pretty that some people dont know how to approach me. I say What? First I don't think I am pretty, and second, if they knew me, they'd have their share of surprises. I am human too! It's difficult to talk about because I feel embarrassed even suggsting that I am physically attractive! I believe everyone has good qualities, and mine are no different; I'm the way I was created, aren't you? So I try to appear more approachable; I smile more, I listen intently, and I care about what you say and do. I really care. Still, I can see the reaction some people seem to have: she thinks she's so perfect! NO! I don't! and I don't expect that from you either.
-1	negative	health Confessions	For some reason, I keep going back to those damn sites. I don't know why I do that to myself. It's just another wayof feeling rejected. I keep approaching guys and not one writes back. I'm no supermodel, but I'm not a freaking monster! What is it that men expect to find on a dating website? Ugggh I must have written to like 15 guys. Guys who, supposedly only care about personality and are interested in deep interesting conversation, but it's a bunch of crap. All they want is an easy lay. Tell me the truth guys. Do you agree with me?
-8	negative	health Confessions	for the baby room instructor. I smelled something so vileso very vile.And this could have reminded me of any number of things,but you know what?It brought me back to our marital bed - and your "toys" - and what I had to do to satisfy you.Everything was about you,you and your wants and needs,and your horrific baggage -literally, life with you was all about YOUR CRAP!!!!!
-1	negative	health Confessions	for the last two months i have been steadily losing interest in everything. I sleep until 11am. And then this week it has gotten a lot worse. I don't get out of bed at all. When I even try to get up, the strain of trying to get up rocks me back into bed. i feel drained all the time. just exhausted. i'm depressed and will not seek "Professional help" because of the way it was used against a friend of mine. My house is a mess. I don't care about picking anything up i have been taking xanex like pez and feel like i'm sleepwalking. My husband is deaf to my cries for help. he knows nothing even though i tell him everything. Idon't have the effort to find a job. I dont know what to do i'm so scarred and at the same time i just don't care.
-7	negative	health Confessions	For the last year, at least, I've had feelings for you but it's not right. I'm too young and I know it. You're not mine to want. I didn't used to feel anything for you, but the more time I spent with you, I don't know, I just couldn't help it. No one's perfect and Iknow that but you're everything I'veever looked for. All i think about is you. ALL the time. I'd do anythingjust to see you, even if it hurts. Ihate it. It's not something I'm proud ofbut I need to say something because otherwise I'll never be able to move on.
-2	negative	health Confessions	For the longest time I'd fantasize about someone listening to my side and his side and saying I was right and he was wrong. When we finally went to a counselor, she said I was right, he was wrong. It didn't make me feel any better.

-7	negative	health Confessions	For the past two years or so, I've become somewhat obsessed with giving up on life. There's not a day goes by that I don't envision taking my own life.The reasons vary, and if anyone would look at me they'd call me a fool; as I seem to have everything to live for. I recently got married, I have a decent job, andI don't have a lot of stressbut, I have some health issues and those things are keeping me from enjoying life"fully". I have a morbid sense of imagination and it's that which conjures up demons that haunt me. I am tormented by things which I don't know the whole story of, and things which I've done or failed to do. I regret my past and I feel as though I've wasted the best part of my life with someone who didn't have my best interests at heart. I've failed miserably athaving a life and now I'm suffering for it. I know that in my heart I won't do anything, but sometimes I wonder

-3	negative	health Confessions	Get mad when I think about the basic incompatibility of me and my spouse. Angry beyond angry at him, and his incorrigible defiance. I shouldn't have to act as his mother and nag him to pay attention to me. I have been told I am worthy of attention. His behavior certainly doesn't reflect it. Too many problems to even know where to begin. Will start counseling as soon as possible, but until then, lonely and angry and blood boiling angry. Did I mention angry? I don't even know that counseling will help. Our "relationship" has already devolved to the point of nasty. It's awful. The worst kind of lonely is when you're lonely in a marriage.

-1	negative	health Confessions	God dammit I am in   with the idea of being in love. And I make myself believe that I am in love with you when I really don't understand the emotion at all. Honestly, I don't think any of us do. Why does everything get ruined by feelings?

-8	negative	health Confessions	got back from Oregon last week. A 100 year old farm house on 250 acres of pristine woods. I would sit out in the early morning cold and watch the wolves, coyotes, bear and elk. I hated coming back to LA. She's very sick. Butwe enjoyed seeing each other so much. I promised her I'd be back by late February/early March. Sooner if she needs me.It's funny, it's a different kind of cold there. I could go out, into the snowin just a hoodie and gloves and feel comfortable. Hereon the coastI'm NEVER warm. It's a dampto the bonekind of cold:O(

-16	negative	health Confessions	Guess what Josephine, your one of a kind, your beauty shines and makes me blind.  If you read this, I hope your intrigued, so please stay a while and read, read, read. Your a star in my sky, so you always shine, just about every time.  You'll never know the truth  about me, so I wrote this love letter in hopes to succeed. So, if it does I'll feel hope, but the other way around and I may begin to mope. So, have you guessed it yet, is it clear, or is this letter a tad bit queer.  I love you girl just to let you know, and I'll climb the rope and never lose hope.  I hope you realize that your one of a kind, and that I will love you until the end of time. Written by: Me

-2	negative	health Confessions	Haha. That was obviously written by a dark skinned person who feels bad about themselves, SMH. A woman's pregnancy weight has nothing to do with getting sun, and it is NEVER grotesque to be white.

-2	negative	health Confessions	Happy Birthday to my beautiful husband in heaven! It's only been 7 short weeks since you left my side. I miss you so bad it hurts. Sometimes I think if I just wait long enough you'll come walking up the drive way and run straight into my arms and I will be complete again.

-8	negative	health Confessions	Have the worst cramps ever, they really are quite severe and I should see doc, I've been vomitting all day, constant needing of the toilet, and now I am paralized, yet my mother thinks i'm a hypercondriac!! I need to see doc and go on contraceptive pills because I can't stand living like this, I wonder what it would take for her to take me to the doctors -.-" should I cut off a leg? nope perhaps all my limbs will get a trip to doc =.="
-2	negative	health Confessions	Having chronic illnesses makes you see the pettiness in other problems. friends Confessions
-1	negative	health Confessions	Having to live with the affects of another's decisions.  I guess when It's. Goodit's danger great. When it's bad, It's real bad.   I worry my English might need more whatever it takes.
-12	negative	health Confessions	He cheated because he is a cheater. They have low self esteem and need constant validation. It's really quite pathetic. Think about it. If a man is good lucking, charming, successful and has personality for miles, he will like himself. He will look at the woman he is with and think, damn, I've got the best girl. If you don't like yourself, you will always think there is something wrong with the person who you are with because they do like you.   Cheating has nothing to do with you. It is a choice that your partner has made. BUT, it seems that you think very little of your own self. Might want to look into that.
-8	negative	health Confessions	He does not   me or want to be with me, anything that doesn't rhyme with that is the load of crap. I am trying to move on and my mantra is the TRUTH. This is not about my girlfriends, it is about him and me or rather the lack there of him and me. Why are you bothering me? I am trying to fall out of love..this is the hardest
-3	negative	health Confessions	He doesn't   me like he says he keeps on trying to change me
-8	negative	health Confessions	he GAVE ME UP! for his wife (not his kids, like he says - that's just what he tells himself because he's too afraid to admit that it's too big a change to get a divorce and he's too comfortable with things the way they are!) and moved back home and looked me in the eyes and told me he can't leave them no matter how much he loves me. And I was dumbfounded and devastated and hysterical and completely undone . . . I believe he still loves me, but NOT ENOUGH!!!! to leave her.The bottom line is the bottom line - he didn't want me. And I don't want someone who doesn't want me. This is why I would never try to reach out for him again. As much as I ache for him and feel desperate to see him and try to convince him that he made a mistake . . . I WOULD RATHER CUT OFF BOTH MY ARMS THEN GO DOWN THAT ROAD AGAIN!!!!! Nothing will change him, but I sure can change ME.
-2	negative	health Confessions	He got our kitty back From those losers two houses up Who stole her!!!!!

-7	negative	health Confessions	Here's the deal im in   but the girl im in love with is five years younger than me. I know her through my neighbor her mom is dating him and im freinds with one of his kids. The real kicker is that if i ever wanted to be with her id have to wait five years to be with her because shes only thirteen. I know its wrong that i love a thirteen year old and i dont want to go into why but trust me i really do care about her and love her. But i feel i really need to tell her and im afraid if i dont something could happen to where i could never be with her.

-12	negative	health Confessions	He's been texting me all week, he's meant to be on a family holiday, although we all know it's just his daughter keeping him there. His wife has told him there's nothing there anymore but she's keeping him for the sake of their child. He keeps telling me he loves me, that he needs me, that he can't let go, yet he isnt letting himself be available. It's really doing my head in, I try to pull back but somehow always end up with him back in my arms. I do love him, but what he has already, I cant ever have
-1	negative	health Confessions	he smokes and I don't he drinks and I don't and I'm paying for all of it. all of it.  selfish f'ing bastard.
-14	negative	health Confessions	He's too kind to her, but its ok. He was just as kind to me. In different ways but in the same way. He's just so much stronger than us, than anybody. Its nice to see he doesn't change much. Maybe its an aspie thing, but I'd like to see it as a Shadow thing. Its just who he is. He's going to leave her. I know that. I felt that after we talked, though he didn't say it out loud. I'm sure he was careful about his words and intended on me feeling whatever I felt. Its difficult not being able to trust my instincts around him, but I know I trust him. So if he pulls my strings a little here and there, and since I know he's doing it for my benefit, it doesn't bother me. He and I wont be getting any closer, though. I felt that too. But he was sure to say it, just in case.
-3	negative	health Confessions	He was  selfish pig. My kids were happy and sweet. He made them tough and brought pain. Never help, no follow-through ; just nastiness. Now I have to live with the fallout, the delays, the estrangement, the staff who try hard and he undoes EVERYTHING. I hate what he did to our family. Life is almost impossible and he created every problem. I detest him""!!!

-14	negative	health Confessions	Hi im a 30 yr old woman who despite being ugly has a pretty good life a man who loves me and two amazing children. I really hope that maybe talking about what its like to be ugly with people who also go through life feeling the same will help me.  most days i can put on a brave face and even have a little fun but being ugly consumes nearly every thought and the anxiety that goes with it can be dibilatating i cant help wishing and dreaming about what life would like if i were pretty i constantly tell myself that i should be happy with what i have and i pray that one day i will stop feeling so bad about myself and learn to accept it. I could really use some advice from people like me on how they cope with being ugly perhaps theres things i can learn from those great people out there in the same boat as me thank you

-3	negative	health Confessions	How can you BELIEVE that I am FINE when I said I just passed out? NO ONE NOTICED that I passed out. Does anyone hear a tree fall when it falls in the forest? I am NOT FINE - I passed out on the floor and NO ONE EVEN NOTICED and when I came to, no one STILL noticed and I am not so worried about that, but if I had cracked my head when I passed out, and been bleeding - I COULD HAVE BLED OUTand no one would have noticed? I guess that is how much my life means to ANYONE I am not fine.

My heart is broken, my lungs collapsed, my head foggy, my eyes tired, and my need to feel something is void. Please save me, I'm not sure how you could but please, just save me from myself.And through it all 
-5	negative	health Confessions	How dare you make light of this. We put up with you for YEARS! Poor little rich boy who lost so much. You are STILL playing the victim! As you leave a path of horror - you and your despicable first wife. You should sell your kids since you both love money so much, and disappear to wherever you elitest ingrates go. Then all will be right with the world again and we will dance at your new ex's wedding with JOY!

-6	negative	health Confessions	how many people think merely squirting out a baby makes them an expert on parenting. The current crop of teens and young adults is proof that a huge number of parents have no idea what they're doing and should never have had children in the first place.

-3	negative	health Confessions	how multiple personality disorder works. One personality can become dominate to hide and protect the others. This is one reason that people like Hurl withDissociative identity disorder, can be so difficult to treat.
-16	negative	health Confessions	how selfish it is to ask someone to go on living an unbearable life just to please you? It's not selfish to do with what is YOURS as you please. It IS selfish to take over what belongs to someone else and demand that they let you use it. That is what it means to interfere with a suicide. If you think someone doesn't really mean it, or that they really could solve their problems, that's different. But say you're talking about someone who is really out of options, and you can't find any practical way to help. By practical, I mean more than useless platitudes about how life is always worth living and things always work out, because things do NOT always work out. Ask anyone who's sleeping on the streets tonight. In such a case, it is supremely selfish of anyone to demand that another person go on suffering just because you want them alive. Unless you can give that person everything it would take to make their life tolerable, it's none of your business.
-14	negative	health Confessions	hye. i think i have problems but the thing is, i just dont know how to express my feelings. i get my result yesterday and that was not very good. i got all B's. my friends thought that that was pretty good, but my parents dont understand me. i have tried hard for this, eventhough it is not my type of subject. im not into science subjects. but i dont hate that, at least i tried. right now i just felt bad about myself seeing others got pretty good results but not me. haih. i gaveup. cause i think even my parents didnt show any support on what i like to be.
-6	negative	health Confessions	I absolutely hate it when people say I dont know certain things or that I dont understand things because of my age. It makes me so angry.Or when people say I like the things or say certain things because of my age, its like.. I like the things because I like it, not becuase of my age..People are so clueless.I honestly feel Im really mature for my age, yes I do have a sense of humor, like most people. I dont think the type of sense of humor someone has has anything to do with their age.Uggghhh, my gosh.

-1	negative	health Confessions	I also have this craving to be f@cked in the . The feeling is overwhelming!
-2	negative	health Confessions	I always feel pathetic when I cut. Mostly it's because I don't do it hard enough to count as real punishment Only a couple of minutes/hours afterwards do I start feeling disgusted that I did it at all. That's how I'm feeling now - disgusted.
-6	negative	health Confessions	I always find myself doing it again and again. I try to fight it but the more i think about it the more it starts to take over and then im doing it again. I hate that i cant control myself. It seems so hard to win a fight when the enemy is inside you Losing myself again.
-4	negative	health Confessions	I always have been different I guess. I'm the quiet type, the girl that will sit in the corner just listening to music. People around where I live dont like that, around here, you have to be a skinny blonde girl who jumps from one guy to another. Because I'm nothing like that, Im not blonde, Im not skinny, I dont jump from one guy to another. And Im writing this because I know there are people in this world that feel the same as I do. And they get treated different, and they feel like hardly anyone cares about you, or people aviod you. Well, your not alone! People push me around, People laugh at me, People bully me, I do well in school and I get treated badly for that, well thanks to that, Im not even showing up at school now. If you feel the same way, You are not alone! x
-6	negative	health Confessions	I always have this one wish that you will   me more than you had ever loved anyone else. It would make me so happy. I wish I could tell you I was in love with you, but I'm afraid to admit it. I'm waiting for you.
-3	negative	health Confessions	I always liked you because you treated me as one. Laying in bed cuddling watching movies but really talking. Being in your arms was the best thing. Your warmth was amazing. Your kisses are still on my lips. Always knew how to make me feel special but I didn't know how to respond. I would push you away and take you back like head games. I just wanted to say sorry for the games I played but now I realize I missed out. You treated me like a princess but didn't see it clearly until now. I miss you.
-7	negative	health Confessions	I always thought that I had never felt   for anybody because I just hadn't met the right guy. And now I met a perfect one. He makes me laugh, he desires me, he is nice and is always there. But I don't feel anything. Nothing at all. It almost seems like the years of disappointment left me too numb to feel anything.What is wrong with me?
-16	negative	health Confessions	I always thought there was something wrong with me when it came to matters of the heart.  I knew from an early age that I couldn't stand political correct guys. When I meet a guy on the first date I will already know in that first 5minutesif he is dominant or not. And for me a turn on is a dominant man. I like a man that holds the door and orders my dinner for me. A man that says I'm the king and your my queen and you will do what I say or you will be punished. Why is that so wrong? Why do i get looks from people especially women when I say I want to be controlled and not the one in charge. It use to be like that back in the day and life was so muchsimpler. And the problem these days is I can't seem to find that dominant man who takes care of things. I believe men have become soft!

Totally unrelated to the noncancerous tumors. I am trying to be optimistic. I am a massage therapist. My whole career revolves around my hands. My arms. My elbows. I will be out of work for a month. I don't think I will be able to pay rent in this time. I have already used the local food bank and assistance because my dad died this summer and I had to use all my money to get down south to see him before and while he died. I can't ask for help from the local places anymore. They told me they won't help. What do I do? I can't think of anything. Please help.

-3	negative	health Confessions	I am a financially independent woman in her mid twenties with a good career. I would be seen  as confident and self- assertive and at times even abrasive. However , when I am with my parents, I regress  and fall into the same relationship I have always had with them, very docile and biddable. They were highly authoritarian and disciplinarian and in their eyes I am very much still their little girl who must do as she is told because mum and fad know best.
-5	negative	health Confessions	i am afraid of the doctor. I have these things that are similar to seizures that happen to me and I told my doctor and he looked at me and said "I have no idea what that is, lets do some tests."

-6	negative	health Confessions	I   a man I can't have.  I think he loves me too.  We don't talk about it since he's in a relationship.  Yes, he's cheating on his girlfriend of many years with me.  Strangely, I do not feel guilt for my role in all this.  I don't know what he feels we just don't talk about it.  I wish I could stop all this, but I feel drawn to him.  Like there's a thread of life that connects us and to sever it would be like severing life.  Everything we're doing is wrong only because of his first commitment.  But, if I had my way, it would last for him and I forever. friends Confessions

-17	negative	health Confessions	I am at least now aware of it. I have only been dating for a little over 5 months. I have found that the guys that I really start to fall for I end up scaring off.I guess it has been so long since I have been in the dating world, and I just suck at it. At first all is well, they are really into me, and me them, then right as we are getting to the point where you decide to either be monogamous I get super insecure, attached and just scare them away. I end up getting my feelings involved and hurt. I want to be in love, I want someone to love me for me.. .I am so tired of being alone. It has been a year and 3 months since my ex tried to kill me, I am alive and I want to lvie, I feel like I am just walking through life in my prime years like a zombieWhat ever is meant to be will happen. And I know that somewhere there is someone whom can handle this kaotic butterfly. funny Confessions
-14	negative	health Confessions	I am at the hospital, Nichole is out of surgery and I have spoken to her and I know that she is okay so I decide to finally go to the restroom and go downstairs to have a cig. I went to the restroom and looked in the small mirror (only a head shot) and begin to walk down the hall to the elevator and notice ppl looking at me. I had a long sun strapless sun dress on but I thought it looked at the very least 'ok', so my first thought was "well * you I just got off a 5hr flight a few hrs ago!" My 2nd thought was "i must look as bad as i feel" but i went on walking to the elevator, into the gift shop and picked up a few things, and on my way outside when a very cute doctor says "Mam" and points to my chest. I automatically look down and notice that my left boob is hanging out!!! Yes, I did have a bra on but that didn't make the embarrassment any less at that moment!So please ppl if you see someones boob hanging out tell them before they share it with too many others!

-5	negative	health Confessions	I am currently in a relationship with a woman who isn't beautiful, and can be a real **. I feel like a jerk for saying all of this, partly because i am a scrawny and unappealing man. I am extremely tempted by this stunning, shy girl who my friends hate, but somehow she likes me. I am loyal, and whenever i start to be absent minded and flirt with her, i quickly  feel guilty and remember that I am going out with a successful and creative woman who I do love when I'm around her. I do love my girlfriend, but I am contently tempted by the girl of my dreams who suddenly changed her mind about liking me once i started going out with my girlfriend, that stunning girl i mentioned earlier, and a really cute girl I play music with. I feel like a pig, but i needed to get that off my chest. And in all honesty my girlfriend is not unattractive, its just that she is only a tad overweight, i don't blame her it runs in her family. But she is a ** to alot of my friends.

She said I am not back yet and that my work is a big mess (it was never true). So the salary controller asked her if they could not put me of for incapability.She replied "The sooner the better."My heart is broken about this. I went to our financial manager and he said that he will tell me in person if my work is in a mess - but it is NOT and was NEVER.

But I am afraid of that I wont be able to get through it and make it.I know that's dumb because smoking doesn't get you through anything and that's all mental.

Getting back into crossfit and boxing has helped.but those are only temporary spurts of distraction that elevate my mood for the duration of activity.and then I am back to feeling down.Work, family, love- I miss my best friend. I miss feeling free-spirited. I miss having mobility.I miss being a passionate person with many hobbies. I used to write, paint, play musicLISTEN to musicnone of it seems to resonate the way it used to with me, which further sinks me into the mire.I dont even care anymore how bland I sound, voicing my unhappiness. *&%#@^%$!
-3	negative	health Confessions	i am starting to like other girl.. though a am in a relationship..and i know deep inside that the girl i am in a relationship with is the one i love.. what am i gonna do???
-1	negative	health Confessions	I am still hereNever leftNever forgot And never will.Love moves in mysterious ways.
-13	negative	health Confessions	I am still paying bills you racked up from years ago.   Makes me sick that I have to go without to pay for things you did to spite me.    It was in the many many thousands. and my name was on the bills so what am I gonna do?  Ask you to help out?  Your day will come and you have no one to blame but yourself. I am patient and much smarter than you ever gave me credit for. My guess is you think it is all behind you forever.   NO.
-3	negative	health Confessions	I am still scared of what it could really mean to love you. I'd have to give up everything I've grown comfortable with, everything I have done to make a niche for myself here and go to you. You can't come to me. Not only must I go to you, but I must work at healing and protecting you when so often I feel like I can't heal or protect myself. Loving you feels light but the burden of being who you need to me to be feels heavy.
-18	negative	health Confessions	I am the kind of person that really cares. I accept others as they are, dont try to change them- just enjoy conversations etc. Im not the most exciting person on earth I admit, but I do care.Being dumped as a friend is painful. Maybe they wanted "something else" or they were just being polite all along, but I was being myself the whole time- that's why it hurts. I suppose Im naive, but if you cant be yourself on HERE then who ARE you? Im just me and I am not going to pretend to be someone Im not in order to gain fake friends.if someone likes me, they like me and if they dont, they dont. Simple really, but sad when you thought they were a true friend 
-4	negative	health Confessions	I am the manager (technically) of a shop that buys clothes of people to go to the poor. We get some strange customers. friends Confessions
-13	negative	health Confessions	I am thinking of having an affair. I am 27. My husband and I have been married for three years and we have not seen each other face to face in two years. He is from a foreign country and cannot come to the US until I am financially stable enough to show that I can support him until he finds a job here. And I cannot move to his developing homeland because I would never be able to earn enough money there to make my American student loan payments. We are stuck. He is depending on me, and I never tell him or anyone else how very lonely, sad and stressed I am. I dont know whether or not I would be tempted to have an affair if my husband was with me. But hes not. And he hasnt been for a long time. I have been alone for two years now and it has been so hard. I feel like I am starving for in-person intimacy. I love my husband, but I feel like I cant take this anymore. I am in so much pain all the time from being alone. Am I a terrible person for wanting to have an affair?
-4	negative	health Confessions	I am tired of being the strong one, I wish someone could take over till I regain some strength. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy helping others but it can be draining especially when I am the one who needs aid. I don't want to give up; I just want time to recuperate.
-8	negative	health Confessions	I am tired of fighting over and over again for a worthless gain; I've become the same * I hate a useless scum made to deliver "joy" and "amusement" to all brutes and selfish idiots, claiming nonsense. There is something that I win in death and that is something no one can give me alive and that is peace.
-1	negative	health Confessions	I am tired of my parents and I just want to move out and in with my boyfriend. I am so upset right now. I hate school and money.
-7	negative	health Confessions	I am truly ashamed to cry, especially around people. It is the feeling of defeat, weakness, and sensitivity all wrap up into one. I cried at least once a day in an area where no one can hear me. When I was younger, I used to cry at class a lot and got teased brutally about it. It was so bad that crying was the only way that I fell asleep at nights.Sometimes, I cannot stop the tears from flowing.I inform a friend about it, but she told me to brush it off. This is not a type of thing I can brush it off with. It can never be brush off.
-1	negative	health Confessions	I am truly blessed i have faced death and many horrible obstacles  and always come out on top.god is good
-7	negative	health Confessions	I am unemployed and in horrible financial straits. My husband is a Soldier so we have a guaranteed paycheck that meets our most basic needs but that is it. My 3 boys are going to get dollar store gifts for their birthdays and homemade gifts for Christmas. They are not materialistic and say they need nothing but I know they will be disappointed. I am digging food out of dumpsters to provide groceries. I am just beyond demoralized. 
-1	negative	health Confessions	I am very intolerant of others who are singing, brazenly,or generally playing,having a good time. I prefer people to be serious, because life is serious, it's not a joke, and those who think it is a joke, well they end up less successful (but perhaps happier?). It's because I'm jealous that I cannot do those things and they can. I feel like I'm wasting my life by being scared to do such things and I hate these people for it. Doesn't that make me sound terrible?
-1	negative	health Confessions	I am very relaxed today glad to see most of you are having fun *hugs*
-1	negative	health Confessions	I am writing my first letter to you Dearest sweetheart of mine.. Sincerely, yours true I love your sapphire eyes, genuine and blue. There is nothing like waking up to your dream come true. Cloudy nights, big, bright stars May I come and take you with me? We won't go too too far. The moon will shine through over us tonight. May I pull you in? This'll feel so right. Let's make this our last love. Darling, don't go. I will love you forever and I will miss you so.
-5	negative	health Confessions	I am young. I'm 17 but I still wish I was younger. It kinda scares me being a legal adult. I remember going to the hospital once and the guy brought that up. It made me feel like I had to be more responsible when I turn 18. I know that's not true but if I could, I would be 15 again. It feels like ever since what happened at 15, the years went by fast.
-10	negative	health Confessions	I   and hate getting hit on by guys. I love that it makes me feel special and desirable, like Im better than the others girls he could be hitting on. I hate that the only guys interested in me dont know me. They see me but they dont know my personality. I get hit on for how I look. So I feel special in the beginning but soon they realize who I am. They lose interest fast. But theyve already gotten what they wanted, at least a taste of what they wanted. Im smart enough to only give a little. But a little takes a lot out of me and I never get it back.So stay away from me. I dont trust you. You just want to hurt me. Were all selfish creatures and youre no exception.
-4	negative	health Confessions	I ate 2 big bowls of cereal last night and I shouldn't have done that.  I'm worried that it has made me gain weight or that it will in a few days.  I hate this I never stop thinking about food I wake up in the middle of the night wondering what I ate. friends Confessions
-4	negative	health Confessions	I attend   presently and get girls phone numbers often. However, I ditch the numbers ASAP to avoid temptation. My boyfriend loves me intensely and speaks of marriage often. I don't know what to do or say. I absolutely love him also, but my attraction to women and the missing part of me that I still desperately crave adds a self-destructive turmoil to my psyche.
-8	negative	health Confessions	I became bulimic to  . Meaning I would throw up after everything I ate, This really messed up my teeth. Well anyways, I became really skinny but whenever I ate anything even healthy snacks I felt like I had gained all my weight back, and that I looked fat. So I started throwing up again to insure myself that I wasnt going to get back to the way I was. Im 16 and I don't eat over 200 calories a day because if I do then I feel unshure and unhappy. I really wish I could get some help and start eating again, but without gaining any weight. I might even want to lose a couple more pounds. Help? friends Confessions
-16	negative	health Confessions	I believed every word you said. About how much you loved children, how you felt meaningless without them. Why did you say those things? I told you from the start that I only wanted to have fun, for a brief instant, until my life got crazy, until I went back to school to get a job to take care of my daughter. But you were determined to prove my perceptions wrong, to come in, like a hero, saying all of the right and beautiful things. And I believed. Why did you do it? Why did I believe you? Of course I was secretly vulnerable, secretly desperately searching for a father for my daughter. Well, I trusted you, and I made hasty decisions. So, now, I have two children with no father. And I'm to blame. For trusting. 
-9	negative	health Confessions	I believe I have found my person and I am happy. I have never wanted you back. I never loved you, never even came close. I don't care how you feel about me and I don't care that you will never see or know me. But I'm an empath and you have tapped into my energy. It drains me so. That is what this is all about. I feel your pain and energy because I let you in when I thought you were someone else. I am trying to get you out. I will send you goodness from afar without attachment, but I am tapped dry and have nothing else left for you. Please stop thinking about me. Thank you for the lessons.
-14	negative	health Confessions	I believe in God and jesus. im not a good person. I sometimes blame god for the way my life is . but I cant help but still love god. I feel like im in this crazy relationship with someone I cant see or hear. I have faith that there is a god and that my god is real. but why did he choose me to be me. I have so many defects and I have a hard time connecting with people. never had a friend that stuck by me even though I was there for them. always picking up other people so maybe one day someone might do the same for me one day. what peopledon't know is that im not happy and I cant remember the last time I was happy. its like I have an inner war between loosing myself and finding who I really am. friends Confessions
-11	negative	health Confessions	I booked a flight with them last year and paid for flight cancellation insurance but when I had to cancel the flight the insurance meant nothing. Now when I am trying to book a new flight with them they are saying that my file expired some time in the past year, they know not when, but it has expired. Now on top of the $200 processing fee I have to pay to use my $570 credit because they wouldn't give me a refund, I have to pay an extra $50 to book with the airline. And all this after being on hold for 1:03:41 and countingI am now telling everyone I know DO NOT BOOK WITH EXPEDIA!

-8	negative	health Confessions	I buried my   yesterday. This has been the hardest week of my life. I cannot even begin to express how devistated I am.  My grief is leading me to seek comfort from the wrong person. I realize it is the grief. I know I heading in the wrong direction. I know my actions would cause more heartache in the long run. But right now it's the only thing that feels good.
-2	negative	health Confessions	I buy ice blocks and melt them, I finally feel the power that I lost. I cut myself to feel the pain, it makes me happy. I watch myself bleed because of the feeling. I'm not weird, or insane. I just. Want someone to notice for once so they can hold me and tell me everything will be okay while I cry. Mum, the smiles you see aren't real. I'm not your perfect daughter. Dad, stop making me feel bad about myself, making me feel worthless and that I'm not wanted. Why can't someone see that I'm not okay?
-7	negative	health Confessions	I call my crush a Blue Moon because thats how often I see him. He always causing butterflies in my stomach but he whole heartingly always leaves me feeling like im one of a kind.this guy has no idea how I feel and it makes it more exciting when we do hangout. Im no different w him than I am w my other friends. since we live such different lives @ such a distance  apart he is something I look forward to having around even if it is once in  a 'Blue Moon'

-13	negative	health Confessions	I can keep myself from killing my  .My PTSD and depression are making me too hard to live with.I keep snapping at her for stupid reasons faster than I can stop myself.Apologies only go so far, and this is too old ground for us.She deserves better than me.I don't know that I will want to survive it being over, guess I'll find out when it comes.Another failed relationship, like all the friends I've lost and all the family members I've alienated.too bad I trust her more than I have trusted anyone before, love her more than anyone.My wonderful, generous, kind, brilliant wife.I still can't overcome the worst of myself for her, no matter how hard I try. I guess I never will.
-1	negative	health Confessions	I can never self-harm as much as I think I should. It may sound sick, but I feel weak for not taking my anger out on myself.
-1	negative	health Confessions	I cannot fly without you, without your wing.
-1	negative	health Confessions	I cannot knock on your door. I am not certain it is you. I need certainty. Otherwise, I will hope and pray that we cross paths where we both feel safe to meet. I'm still not convinced this isn't a game to have me come to your door, and then you slam it in my face.
-1	negative	health Confessions	I can not stop thinking about this woman who works for me.  She is incredibly cute and has very sweet liitle body.  We have a great time, but both being married What am I to do?
-3	negative	health Confessions	I can pretend I don't   you, but that doesn't change the fact that I totally and completely do. I love you. I'm waiting for the right time to tell you, but honey, you have had my heart since day one. It's hard to contain it, and I want for you to know But you deserve the best, because you are a queen.
-3	negative	health Confessions	I can read people's thoughts too. I have that power, not everyone does.
-2	negative	health Confessions	I can sense him plotting brooding watching us waiting  can you hear him breathe? hes here..
-7	negative	health Confessions	I can't believe how far I fell. I also realise at my lowest you just emotionally/verbally abused me. Got your own back for me hurting you? I was honest and said I was sorry. I explained everything I felt to you and all you did was use it ALL against me. I feel ashamed and weak for how open I was and how low I got. I am still a mess now as my depression got so bad. I hate myself for it all but I can't get out of this. I have no one to help me. My confidence has fallen to the bottom and I have shut myself away. I am a shadow of what I once was so vibrant and happy. funny Confessions
-5	negative	health Confessions	I can't believe I just randomly saw you in the store.  She is cute but doesn't seem mature enough to be your wife.   At a loss for words, but how I wanted to talk!  How many times have I imagined.running into you.  I miss you.   The end arrived before the beginning and oh how my heart broke that you wouldn't and didn't speak.   Thanks for giving clarity about what I misunderstood previously.
-5	negative	health Confessions	I can't believe I'm about to say this, and I know it's awful and prejudiced, but I've been brainwashed as a little kid to think this, and I know most of you have too. Whenever I see a man in a turban, I always get really scared. It's horrible, I know. I really want to be tolerant and I hate profiling and stereotyping, but this is just one of those things that's a little harder to shake off.
-4	negative	health Confessions	I can't believe I'm actually admitting this, I still love him. I'm with his friendhe doesn't want him and I still love him. I've tried to deny it for so long, but it's just undeniable, I hate myself for loving himwe were so close then everything just got ballsed up I just wish I could go back in time and never meet him, life would be alot easier.
-8	negative	health Confessions	I cant be with you, but I still   you. My heart is beginning to learn how to beat again without the pain. Before I sleep every night I pray you find someone special and wonderful like you. I know your soul isn't at rest and I wish would allow me to soothe your hurt.  You tought me that love isnt ownership and that by loving you and not having you I could give of myself and that expectations have no place when it comes to loving and being in a relationship. Love you good night.

I try to let you go, but when I try a little, it`s like you feel it from distance, and then you come back..to fool again with my heart. Why? I hope you`ll be loved and happy..you broke my heart and took it with you when you left. Because I see you in people. Last week I caught myself waching somebody who resembled you so much..I hated it. I hate how much I love you.. Please release me..or talk to me, d*mn it! Don`t talk behind me, don`t look in everyone`s eyes except mine..it kills me..it kills me to see you, but ironically, my heart brakes when I don`t hear from you.. I tried to fool myself..but can`t fool my heart. It takes a thousand miles speed when you talk to me..
-7	negative	health Confessions	I can't sleep againI detest being awake at nightly myself.   I took my normal dose of Ambienwaited.nothing.  Huh. So I got up and drank a glass of winethen two.then I decide to take a bath to get me really relaxed.  I am so tempted to take a Xanax, but I'm slightly worried that I could end up in a coma.  This generation has no qualms about mixing drugs.   Sometimes I don't think about it, and other times it scares me.
-1	negative	health Confessions	I can't sleep, far too much rushing round my head. Man, life is complicated but hey maybe one it will make sence
-3	negative	health Confessions	I can't sleep. I don't know why. There are tears in my eyes from the book I was reading. It was supposed to help me fall asleep, but here I am, awake, and teary eyed. Something struck me deeply. I almost wished I hadn't begun reading this book. Although, perhaps it was something I needed to read, for me. Personal growth is a positive thing. Why does it hurt so much? I could make a phone call but I don't know what good it would do. I'd only be waking him up. He needs his rest. Besides, I wouldn't even know how to explain this right now. Maybe I can cry myself to sleep.
-2	negative	health Confessions	I can't stop blaming myself for what happened between you and your group. Even though I didn't do anything to the person who did what they did. And they were the ones who went after me. But I feel like it was my fault that you are leaving your group.But they were not your friends, anyways. So I am glad you are getting rid of them. Well, at least him.I still can't make sense of the the whole situation. Why did that jerk do that?
-8	negative	health Confessions	I can't stop thinking about you- the man who both broke my heart & presented my karma. It hurts to know that I deserved it, but even more, that I still love you from whatever sort of shell is left of me. I wonder if I ever cross your mind I wonder if you regret what you did. I hate thinking that one day you will. It never had to be like this, and that hurts.

The other guy was a one time thing and wouldn't care if a bus hit me to be honest. And I can't bring myself to take a test and confirm it because my relationship is out the window and I know it's selfish but I want to keep him. If I'm pregnant, I need not to be. Can I bring myself to have an abortion?
-1	negative	health Confessions	I cheated on my husband with our best friend. We were both really drunk, not as if that's an excuse. I'm feeling outside my mind about this friend now. Can't stop thinking about him. Of course he is playing it cool. I wish I could to. I don't know if its the excitement of something new but it has my heart palpitating like it hasn't in a long time. I feel so stupid. I can't share this with anyone I know, not even my best friend. It would change everything. funny Confessions

Although I did not lie to you in words, I lied to you with faces that did not belong to me. I never meant to ruin the friendship that meant the world to me. You mean the world to me and now I come to you asking for forgiveness. If in your heart you find you can't, then I will understand and learn from this experience.

-6	negative	health Confessions	I confess that I am in great need of a vacation. Not just a vacation but I need three months of no one bothering me, no loans, no emergencies, no demoing for Chefs, no more 'trail runs' that really mean 'work for free'. I have been spending the last three years writing a few things, if I had three months to myself in a cabin somewhere, preferably near a lake but with electricity. All I need is the time and the place, well and a few other things, three computers, a * load of wine, weed, hash, cigarettes, food. And in three months I could have all nine of my graphic novel manuscripts finished and the notes for my other three completed. Is that so much to ask for?
-19	negative	health Confessions	I confess that I had an argument with my youngest brother last week and kicked him out of the house for the whole night.I felt that I've changed from an innocent Gazelle to a Monster and I was very rude with my youngest brother.It wasn't me at all. I confess that when I get angry I can get bitchy but it's not for nothing I was out of control because my brother disrespected my mother and began to tell her bad things.I felt pity for my brother but I was still to egotistic to tell him that. Instead I called him in the middle of the night from the balcony to get come home and when he did I told him in a loud screaming voice "Look you  hole I called you cose mom told me that I did it for Mom's sake but I'm gonna tell my older brother in Germany on the phone what you've done!!!"And he went in with tearing eyes.
-5	negative	health Confessions	I confess that I have not been to the dentist in about seven years, so that my children could have the money, and go themselves. No issues during that time, and I am expecting all to bewell when I do go in. I do brush and mouthwash at home.
-3	negative	health Confessions	I confess, that no one is right 100 percent of the time, and to assume such of oneself is a surefire way to prove oneself wrong from the get-go. Not only does it hurt one's self, it hurts those around them. To be treated as if one has no credibility with one they care about is like being pushed down repeatedly, and no one deserves that let alone the person one loves.

I am sick of all this.I have paid a heavy price for loving you.It took almost a lifetime for me to acknowledge the truthWe were never meant to be together because you never loved me.
-3	negative	health Confessions	I could sleep for up to 14 hours if I felt sad.I have done it many times.Only bad part is a pounding head when I wake.Some times I feel people (even my husband) should not have to deal with me.When I sleep that much I call it "turning myself off".Often I wish there was a button that could do that.Just until nobody is no longer tired of me.My husband says its not true.He really loves me.This sounds like a pitty party. friends Confessions

-4	negative	health Confessions	I crushed on him for about two years because if you knew him, everything about him is perfect and he's nice, always well dressed, good looking, fun to be around, and responsible. A couple days ago he called our relationship strictly professional. This means, basically, we aren't even friends really. I'm just "there" to him. I'm crushed.
-2	negative	health Confessions	i cut again today.  i couldn't stop the urge it's always there, so i gave in.
-2	negative	health Confessions	I cut and it helps short term. #honestly {{but it's also horribly addictive}}
-1	negative	health Confessions	I cut myself again tonight. And I really don't care about all the scars I've accumulated over the years. friends Confessions
-3	negative	health Confessions	i cut myself on my back because i know that if i go too deep, i wont be able to give myself stitches.  i wash down a few sleeping pills with some rum or whiskey almost every night just to be able to get to sleep.
-2	negative	health Confessions	I cut myself today.It felt nice.
-5	negative	health Confessions	I cut myself today. It wasn't to bad though. It's weird. I remember when i first started i'd get this rush, But I cant seem to recreate that feeling :c
-4	negative	health Confessions	I cut Waaayyyyyy to deep today. Started feeling dizzy, out of breath, and so I went hospital with my mum to have them bandaged and stitched. Schools tomorrow and my anxiety is kicking in. It's worse than ever, and I have no idea how imma deal with. I'm just so sick and tired of living. friends Confessions
-20	negative	health Confessions	i dated a married man and when i fell in love with him i never told him, he would ask me how i felt and i would tell him it was a good time, nothing more. when he stopped making plans with me for about two months i was heartbroken (used to seeing him 2 or 3X a week). completely devastated. last night we hung out and things started getting hot and heavy, when i said no and he asked why i lied and said because i didnt want him to cheat on his wife anymore. that i wanted him to be a good husband. should i tell him that the real reason is that i love him and dont want him if i cant have all of him? that i  am done being his dirty little secret?  i just dont want him to reject me. but maybe thats what i need to get over him.
-4	negative	health Confessions	I dated from the age of 13. I loved people before her, but I didn't truly fall in love until I met her. My whole life led to being back in school when I was 30. She was 20 and beautiful. We dated.. fell in love. She left me.I will never be the same.
-5	negative	health Confessions	I deal with   and one time during one of my manic episodes I touched a girls boob while I was in the hospital. Im lucky to not have gotten slapped. Its not one of my proudest moments and I certainly dont condone groping a woman. Im just telling the truth about what happened. I do some pretty crazy things during my manic episodes. Just check my stories.
-2	negative	health Confessions	i desire my cousin very much, sad thing is that not only he's related but also a devout catholic. so i'm trying hard to suppress this crazy habitnot only for my sake but also his to show that i care and love him too.
-3	negative	health Confessions	I desire to have a meaningful relationship with the people in my church, but I'm afraid that if they saw my world they would condemn me, for a simple wish, or desire, that may not be right, I'm afraid that they will see right through my imperfections and not agree with who I am in the Lord, and flip out on me, thus breaking my weakened soul, It's just happened so many times and I'm so lonely for good people and want to be a good person too. Please God don't let them break me, I long to find healing from my condition, I long to make friends that will last a lifetime, I long to stop being so helpless and become someone worth something to the Lord, and His people. I want to love people.
-1	negative	health Confessions	I desperately want my boyfriend to be here but he's in bed a hundred miles away. I miss him so much, it's been almost half a year now
-12	negative	health Confessions	I'd hate you. You'd be dead to me. I would have performed some voodoo ceremony where I took a picture of you and burnt it and peed on the fire to put it out. But it's not like that. I still love you, unhappily. People come along, interested in dating me - and these are good, decent people, mind you - and all I can think about is stupid you. Not stupid youlovely you. I'm in love with you, but I wonder why. You've treated me terribly and never even apologized. I deserve better than that. I deserve better than you. Yet it's still you who I want. I don't get it.
-6	negative	health Confessions	I did cheat because I opened my heart to one man, while planning my life with another. I am a cheater. I can't escape that. It's just that sometimes I'd like to forget that I am that low and that I ruined the best thing that ever happened to me.
-9	negative	health Confessions	i did it again. i acted selfishly when i could have done something to help. I decided not to help in regards to my wants the worst thing is i don't care, i just wanted to do something and in doing it i didn't help someone. i personally think my conscious is being to strict with me. no one was hurt, either emotionally or otherwise. however my "inner self" disagrees, claiming i did something that shouldn't have happened. geez, i wish it'd leave me alone i only ever complain when i can do something to change it so it annoys me that the voice inside talks so much. it'd be easier if it shut up every once in awhile.
-1	negative	health Confessions	i did not came to you (&stayed) for your work (i wouldn't bother, really).. but for a desire to protect &to know you happy &well.i genuinely just liked you. maybe i just didn't know you yet.
-12	negative	health Confessions	I didn't do a God damn thing and the first thing I hear when my mom gets home is her bitching at me. And it's over some petty bull crap. Yeah sorry youprobablyhad a bad day, but guess what treating me like crap isn't going to make anything better, and it's just going to make me more angry towards your sorry . Just because my brother does something and I'm the first person you see does not mean you should ** at me about it. It means you should take your lazy  up the stairs and confront him about it.
-2	negative	health Confessions	I didn't do well on my final and have been told that I will be expected to do better. It is only making me feel like there isn't any point to going to school. I amthinkingI will end up finishing with only it being pointless in the end.
-11	negative	health Confessions	I didn't have much. 3/4 of sandwich (I don't normally eat bread), two thumbnail pieces of flapjack and not even a handful of crisps. After I ate it, I mentioned that I was still hungry, to which the woman next to me said, "Why, wasn't that enough for you?" as she looked down her nose at me. Well, no it wasn't or I wouldn't have said I was hungry. Two of my friends left to go to the sweetshop, I asked them to get me something too. Again, the lady looked at me and said, "I'm sure you've had enough." The thing is, it wouldn't normally bug me but 1. She doesn't know me 2. It's none of her business 3. ..no, no that's it. That kind of ercked me a little. So I stuffed my face with an m&m brownie and bag of crisps.
-13	negative	health Confessions	I didn't know I had feelings for you. I just started imagining us being together. I admire you and you admire me - it might work. But I don't know. I'm attracted to a lot of people. I want a relationship, but maybe not right now. I think I'd like to test the waters of various relationships. I'm used to having these overwhelmingly passionate feelings for one person and wanting only them But maybe I just thought it was that way. I can want many different people at once. If anything should develop between us, I think I'd be open to exploring what we have. Might be interesting.
-4	negative	health Confessions	I didnt know they hated me until i read it here. I dont talk to them anymore now. I am not stupid.            
-18	negative	health Confessions	I did something really, really bad.  It just kind of happened.  This is my first time writing about it  Like a lot of people, I was molested by an older cousin when I was younger.  The effects that it has had on me years later are astounding.  Anyway, I was once asked if he raped me.  I was worried that if I said no, they would think that I am overexaggerating my problem.  So I said yes and I felt terrible about it. Now I am 21 and it has been 5 years since this happened.  I find myself looking for motherly figures in professors, teachers and other women in my life, probably because my mom never wanted to talk about the molestation.  I tell these women about my 'rape'.  And I know it's sick.  In a way, it helps me to be able to talk about these feelings. I just feel like a terrible person.  I know that I need help.
-1	negative	health Confessions	i dislike it very much when people have posts like this > I hate when ugly people say "I need to get my body right for the Summer." Like WTF are you going to do about that face?!?like if guys even care about that in the first place. Haven't any of you seen Scary Movie, just put a bag over her head. funny Confessions
-15	negative	health Confessions	I dislike my fil sooo much that its keeping me up at night. Yesterday was TG and i am 9 months pregnant and due any day now. Yet i end up going alone, out of town to my families house, because my boyfriend is being manipulated with guilt by his father to spend the day with him. Im tired of this stupid battle of trying to see who gets most of my boyfriends time when to me the answer should be clear. I invite his dad to come with us even and he doesnt want to. He wants to sit and wallow in his sorrow and self pitty and he wants to drag his son down with him. If he cant be happy he doesnt want any of us to be happy either. I completley understand why his oldest son has chosen not to have any type of relationship with him. I want to move out and just let them live happily ever after together. I know my fil would LOVE that idea.
-9	negative	health Confessions	Id like to meet someone but I keep attracting wrong men. Theyre all seriously messed.  I get addicts, pervs, psychos, don juans, stalkers, online playas or guys so bad looking they creep out my elderly mum!  Those are the only guys to ask me.  Cos Im not thin or goodlooking men think Im desperate & should be happy to get just anybody. : ( Yes.  One said so. Said I was picky & the way I look I should be happy to have any man at all. But Id rather be alone 4ever than be with somone I dont like or respect. So so sick of this.  I hate that people think a woman whos not pretty doesnt deserve anything but the dregs.  : (
-2	negative	health Confessions	I'd like to say "Happy Father's Day" to you, but I try not to talk to rapists.
-1	negative	health Confessions	I do not click on links posted to EP. Not only do I have to type it in manually, but some could be harmful. Post lyrics, more people may pay attention.
-5	negative	health Confessions	I do not find it weird. I mean if he is not physically attracted to you, who is he going to get it from? All the same I think you should make him sign the same fat clause.
-2	negative	health Confessions	I do not want to say goodbye to the one I have loved so dearly so so long.  I want to put your love in a box, somewhere safe and if you need it, really need it from me, I will take it out of it's hiding place and let you have it forever.   But you must decide what you really want, what you really need from me or I may forget where I have put it if you wait too long.  That is my truth.
-4	negative	health Confessions	i dont believe in religon is because they speak of things like right and wrong and sins. We are placed on this planet with free will. thats like letting a child pick out a candy bar and then punishing them when they dont choose the "right" one. We're allowed to chose, so we're supposed to make mistakes!
-1	negative	health Confessions	I don't care anymore. I don't want to. It takes too much energy emotions are all over the place. It's easier to just not care. It's easier to be alone.
-1	negative	health Confessions	i dont ever want to eat again.. ever.
-1	negative	health Confessions	I don't expect you to chase me. But, think about what you are saying?! I can't read your mind and you can't read mine. Please try to talk to me. I am human, too, and I need a little encouragement. Just because I come across as gregarious and confident, doesn't mean I'm not petrified and hurt. Please try. I can't do it alone. Am I alone?
-1	negative	health Confessions	I DON'T FEEL EMBARRASSED ABOUT HAVING A PERSONALITY DISORDER STATISTICS SHOW THAT PERSONALITY DISORDERS AND MANY MENTAL ILLNESSES COME FROM BEING BULLIED AND ABUSED!!!! friends Confessions
-1	negative	health Confessions	I don't feel your presence here today.I know you are probably busy enjoying with him.Loving you is a waste of my time.
-3	negative	health Confessions	I don't get mad, I get even. You got my goat out and I'm coming after you. I will wait in silence until the perfect opportunity and then attack. Don't underestimate me. Bigger than you have fallen. If you don't like it, then you  should never have been so dirty and underhanded.
-11	negative	health Confessions	I don't getalong well with my  . The strange thing is though that he doesn't seem to know it. I've told him many times how much I hate him for cheating on my mom ever since I was one and for stealing money from both of us. But he still thinks everything is okay. Because of this, I have been having a re-occuring daydream. He's at my door demanding I spend time with him. I yell at him to leave but he stays and yells back louder. I go back inside and get the metal baseball bat he got me and threaten to strike him if he doesn't leave. He challenges me thinking I won't. I hit himonce with it and knock him down. After that, I stop seeing this through my eyes and all I see is myself repeatedly raising the bat above my headand lowering the bat down past where I can see and a splash of red comes up and hits me each time. I don't really want to kill my father, I just want him to understand the pain he has caused.
-7	negative	health Confessions	I don't give a crap what happens with my husband. He might have to go to jail for awhileand frankly I do not care. He is not working latelydoes not do anythingand is not helping our family out at all anymore. Plus all he wants to do is drinkbut I wont give him money any more to do so. I am just so tired of all of his *If he goes to jail, I will have the best of reasons not to be with him anymore.
-1	negative	health Confessions	i dont hate them because they are black, i hate anyone who acts like an idiot in public, and talks with words that aren't real words, and have "baby mommas" and dont pay child support, and live on welfare and use drugs, and walk with a limp when there is nothign wrong with there legs, and where pants that are 20 sizes too big, and use the word nigga and would shoot me on the spot if i said it too.if you pictured a black person while reading this, your racist. i believe in equal opertunity, i give everyone the chance to be hated equally.
-6	negative	health Confessions	I dont have a lot of confidence to approach you. I think if you reached out to me it would be a lot easier for me to know it's a mutual feeling. I feel so strongly about you, but my reputation is at stake here. I cant be chasing you! Im scared of what people would think, especially if I've misread your feelings and you dont have those feelings for me.I've thought of excuses to see you or speak to youbut it all seems so contrived.
-3	negative	health Confessions	I don't have friends anymore. Over the past several years everyone has drifted away. I go days and weeks without talking to another person except my husband. Sometimes, I look forward to answering junk phone calls, but these days they are mostly recordings  friends Confessions
-10	negative	health Confessions	I dont know what my husband does to my  , but it always has a really nasty taste. Really bitter. He used to try and bring me coffee in bed and get me to stay in bed (Im ill) but I've started to try and be more independant, getting myself dressed and going downstairs, making my own coffee and breakfast.He's controlling. I want to get better and more independant but he likes it when Im ill in bed :/ I've started a new breakfast routine, which he doesnt like and now refuse to have him bring me up coffee. When I was in hospital with severe stomach pains I actually suspected that he could be poisoning me. I have been ill ever since we got back together :/ which makes me suspicious when I was very healthy and active before
-5	negative	health Confessions	I don't know what's led to your change of heart. You don't talk to me much about your feelings. Never have. So if you no longer love me, I'd never know. I'm getting strong signals that you've decided to move on. It's fine. I didn't think this would last forever anyway. I just wish we could have enjoyed at least some of our time together being an actual couple, but maybe that would have been a bit too much of a commitment for both of us. Overall, I think this was a missed opportunity. We could have gotten together, but work and rules got in the way. It's too late now.
-14	negative	health Confessions	I dont know whats worse, not being able to trust him or not being able to leave him. My life is complicated. I am young and have children. Which isnt easy but no regrets at all. I feel by myself anyways so why is it so hard to say its over??? Only if people knew the truth, I wonder how they would walk in my shoes? Sometimes I pray for him to leave but he needs me. I pulled him out of a mess now he brings it in our life. We use to be happy, we use to talk and all that mattered now we are two roomates with children. He cant even save money when I know he has it. I fear he is doing things he use to and its sad. I love him but now not enough to keep fighting for. I know my children and I deserve better so why is it so hard to let go I will never understand
-3	negative	health Confessions	I don't know what you want from me. You tell me you don't want a relationship.You tell me you don't want it anyone else. But then you tell me you miss me.. that you want to be with me.I don't know what to think anymore.I want to let go. But i'm so drawn to you. I see myself with you. I see myself loving you even more now then before.I just don't know what you want.. do you even love me?Then if you do, make a way to be with me. Otherwise soon i will let go and i won't come back.
-23	negative	health Confessions	I don't know who you are, what your name is or what your story is. I just know that I called a distress line tonight, and I talked to you. I want to say thank you, you helped more than anyone else I have ever talked to on that line. I felt like we had a lot in common, and that has been an unbelievably rare thing for me. I have not felt like I have genuinely related to another person in a long time, and that closeness was more valuable than I could have ever imagined. I wonder how much of my struggles have been yours, and how much you have had in common with me. I hope that if you are as close to me as I believe you might be, that you find a way to help yourself like you did me. But for now, thank you. I really needed that conversation, thank you for truly making me feel not alone for the first time in over a year.
-11	negative	health Confessions	I don't know whyand it makes me feel horrible. I used to run from the 'L' word, and I'm realizing just how much i hurt those peopleand if any of them were to pass by me today, i would tell them just how sorry i am. I've ran from that word for years, but nowi have found someone that i have fallen so deeply for, yet i can not seem to say those three simple words to himi want to so much, and when i see him i feel like it might burst out of me, but everytime i try,,,it seems to get caught in my throat and choke me.Why am I so afraid to tell him "I love you" ?
-4	negative	health Confessions	i dont know why but sometimes i'm obsessed with the whole thrill of scary movies. not the ones with tons of gore, but serial killers, how psycho people can be, the cat and mouse chaseit excites me. I don't want to copy these actions, but i'd love to make a movie. only sometimes when im really sad or upset do i have the urge to do something so terrible, but im strong enough to overcome it is this a problem? or am i okay being so obsessed? Why is it i love these kind of movies and tv shows?
-1	negative	health Confessions	I don't know why I tried to be friends with him again. I just missed him but obviously he doesn't care about me. Sigh, why do i let him get to me when its been a year later?
-6	negative	health Confessions	I don't know why nor coul I explain it , but I have an insane fear of analabaster statue depicting the goddess Ishtar..I get a bad vibe (Even if its a photo of it ) from it I just want to throw up or go into a fetal position & wish it never existed Curse that statue!!!!
-5	negative	health Confessions	I don't know why people judge me for no reason!  I've been judged al my life by my friends, family, everyone :/ I don't know why people don't like me just by looking at me.. i mean, do I have a sign in my forehead that says "Stuck-up **"..  no one has really tooken the chance to get ta' noee me in reality! Only one person truly knows me and that's my bff angie that i truely love as a sister. Because that girl never judged me and even though she heard people talk abt me this and that yet she still managed to hang around with me and get ta; noe the real me, and now we're bestfriends!!<3' but other than that, everyone has givin me the same look and attitude! but i guess.. i promise that if theygot to knew the real me everything would be different, and they'd probbly be giving their lives for me. but nah i guess that's how people now a days. So stereotyping..

-2	negative	health Confessions	i don't like my boyfriend at all. he actually disgusts me most of the time. i just want to be with someone. i got too excited and made the relationship into something else in my head, but it's worn off now, and i don't think i can fake much longer without becoming totally numb or exploding and having a mental breakdown.
-2	negative	health Confessions	I don't live online. I was silent because my daughter called and I gave her * for not coming around enough. Then my parents called and gave me * for not coming around enough. Then I made dinner and looked to see you giving me * for not coming around enough.

-4	negative	health Confessions	I don't really have a specific   to make right nowI'm sorry but I'm in a psychological mess and I really need someone to talk to. I couldn't find any sites in my country that offer psychological support so I signed up here. I don't know what my real problem is, I just had a fight with my boyfriend and generally I'm going through a period full of stress and anxiety. I don't know what really bothers me and for what reason I'm nervous, maybe it's the exams that I have for this semester at college or maybe it's something else that I really don't know. You see, I'm very confused because it's something that I don't really understand so I can fight it back. I don't know what to do.
-6	negative	health Confessions	I don't really know what I'm doing. I feel confused right now but that hopefully doesn't matter. I just really need someone to talk to. I've been alone for nearly a year now. I just recently moved from an Air force base to another. Which were both in different continents. Since then I haven't had anyone to talk to. I haven't made any friends. I feel like its my fault that i Haven't. Mainly because the people that will talk to me, I don't want to talk to them. Its just hard living in one continent your whole life and then moving some where brand new. I have been really lonely. I wasn't like this before either. I had a lot of friends before, we hung out a lot. I was never at home or by myself but now I haven't been able to talk to someone in nearly a year. I just really need someone to talk to..
-5	negative	health Confessions	I don't see myself as me. the way I think does not describe who I am now. I feel like I am something else another, another worldly thing. Everytime I look in the mirror I don't see me, but something or someone else. It is like identity theft, I'm trying to find myself, but where do I start? I draw self portraits but they are not me, but a yellow cat like creature. What does this mean.
-5	negative	health Confessions	I don't snoop you. I am even embarrassed to look at a picture you put out there public on that other place. I mean.I couldn't even tell you where a thing in your room isI don't even know where that is. Snoop. I make it a point never to start that. Doesn't mean I don't care just means I want to keep myself in a better place than where snooping which just brings on all kinds of worries and silly thingsleast to me.But, meet you? I'd have to be sure SURE you are the you that you know, you should by now.
-8	negative	health Confessions	I don't think it is about putting gas in your car.something else seems to be bothering him. My advice is to let it go. It actually is very nice of him to offer to do that in the first place, he certainly doesn't have to. Maybe do something nice for him to see if you can get him to open up to you about what is going on with him. Sometimes in relationships, you have to be the giver in that moment, even when it seems unfair to you. Otherwise, little things like this can actually build into much bigger things. Just my opinion.
-3	negative	health Confessions	I don't think I will be doing it again, lol. Too weird for me. Also brought me back down to Earth and reminded me we've both got our own lives to live Nope, I'm just not cut out to be a stalker. Anyone want to share cyberstalking stories? Stalkers and stalkees welcome. : P
-2	negative	health Confessions	I dont understand why people have lost faith in GOD and are falling in tracks that harm themWhat makes them go on drugsThis is really SAD..And for those who sell and harm the innocent why cant they stopWhy cant we have a peaceful environment and be free of such  environment of DRUGS etc
-12	negative	health Confessions	i dont want to be a parent anymore. i was a single parent for 16 years and then here comes my ex deciding he can be a grown up now. my daughter seems happier now. maybe i will let my son go with him tooit may be good for him since apparently im a crap parent. it so jacked up that he went off and did what the hell he wanted while i stayed to be a mom.i did the best that i couldor at least i thought i did. wth. friends Confessions
-1	negative	health Confessions	I dont wear underwear. Im 25 years old and I haven't worn underwear since I was 18!
-4	negative	health Confessions	I don't   you. When you left me for the other woman and wouldnt even explain why you left, you tore my chest wide open and pulled my heart out and set it on fire. You handed the ashes back to me and then walked away, leaving me hurt and alone.I waited for you to come back though, Cause deep down I knew you couldn't stay away from me. You told her that I was a stalker, though i wasnt and that you were the one that couldn't seem to leave me alone.Now your back and though and we have decided that we would try to have this relationship again,But, I don't want you. I don't love you, not at all. You hurt me, you suck and I can't find it in my heart to love any of the things that I once loved about you.
-1	negative	health Confessions	I doubt myself a lot. It's one of the most horrible feelings in the world. I feel like I'm becoming stronger as the days go bybut sometimesI just don't know. I see it, but very few others do.
-3	negative	health Confessions	i dreamed about killing you, even though you are already dead i still want to kill you, like you've killed me a long time ago.
-3	negative	health Confessions	I dreamt of you again last night. Almost three years later, is it possible I'm still not over you? With all the unanswered questions, is it possible I'll ever truly get over you?

-3	negative	health Confessions	I'd write a final letter to you. But I don't think you could accept it calmly and respectfully. I don't think you could Hear  But you would judge me and proobably make fun of me in your blog
-3	negative	health Confessions	I eat my boogers, I think they taste good.
-3	negative	health Confessions	I even feel the gross feeling you get when you run into them again and are like ew.  What was I thinking?  I still have the idea in my head, but it's becoming fewer and farther between without the emotional rush.  I knew those feelings would be temporary but it was still longer than I expected.  I feel like I can be more mechanical and devoid of human qualities like I normally am.  What a relief.
-7	negative	health Confessions	I ever tried to was be his friend. The only thing he ended up doing was making me feel disrespected like I ama piece of meat. I am not the kind of woman who disrespects anyone. You and me can't even be friends, because you don't respectmy boundries, or care about my feelings. You make me feel extremly uncomfortable around you, to the point it's scary. You scare me.

-5	negative	health Confessions	I fall In Love Way Too Fast. I always fall in love too fast and get hurt. It sucks because I am that emotional type of guy, and get my heart broke soooooo easy. Dammit i suck at this game.
-3	negative	health Confessions	I fall madly in   with every boy that seems to like me.  Especially these three that i have been in love with for three years.
-3	negative	health Confessions	I fantasize about my death every day, sometimes I think i am dead and I'm in hell.
-1	negative	health Confessions	I fear loveing you..because i know it will be wiped from my memory ..before i wake
-4	negative	health Confessions	I feel as if i have so much on, everything is just too much to handle. Too much to do! Shower, wash my hair, catch up on homework, edit my photos, cruise tumblr Why do I have my needs and wants so mixed up! I hate school, whats the point? I mean I dont learn anything. Especially my school, Rudolph Steiner Education is a peice of * And a waste of my time.
-6	negative	health Confessions	I feel disappointed when I have no missed calls. I cry if my boyfriend doesnt call to let me know he hasn't forgotten me and this is driving him away. I blowup my boyfriends phone until he blocks me so I get the opposite reaction than what I feel I need. Im tired but I cant sleep straight through the night because I have to make sure I didnt miss any calls and I try to call people and make sure they are ok and just so they dont forget me. I am so afraid of being forgotten that I think people wish they could forget me I get physically ill and throw myself into a depression if it has been more than a day since I spoke to my boyfriend and I feel like I need to quit living my life to be where ever I need to be so I dont miss someone when they need me because I wouldnt want them to feel the way I do.
-3	negative	health Confessions	i feel hated by everyone in my life. i know i don't deserve it but so many people seem to hate me. people that don't know eachother. it really makes me wonder if it's me but then i know i am not a bad person if anything i am too nice. maybe that's the problem. i dunno. but i feel like everywhere i go i make a new enemy.
-1	negative	health Confessions	i feel im capable of so much more. all i want is for someoneto fall in love with me, and make me their world, their everything.
-4	negative	health Confessions	I feel incapable of being loved or being in a relationship. The only one I have been in was a week long because I stopped having feelings for her and whenever I look at other girls I have the feeling of wanting to date them but feel as if they will never actually want to be with me to be with me or if I do date them I will just stop caring again
-2	negative	health Confessions	I feel in my heart that I have no more love in my heart for my husband. There are no more real smiles, no more of anything left. After years of emotional abuse, I do not love him. As a matter if fact, his presence makes me feel somewhat sick. He continuously lies and I have zero trust for him. His verbal abuse has erased good memories and has replaced them with bad ones. I bend over backwards every day to please him and he is extremely ungrateful. His breath, his loud voice and his sarcasm is repulsive. I dream of the day I am free. Free from him.
-2	negative	health Confessions	I feel just a little bit closer to letting it all come out.but the truth, that *bitter, acidic, glaring, in-your-face, stuff you've never said aloud, leaves-a-bad-taste* kind of truth is terrifying to me.. Once I say it out loud, I feel required to do something about itto take stepsand I'm not sure where those steps may lead. That is some scary *
-5	negative	health Confessions	I feel like I am nothing. I feel like I screwed my whole life up. I dont even know what I CAN do with myself. I feel so unproductive. i have depressionand sometimes it seems too hard to bare. I am very lonely. I need help. I need to love myself and to go after what I love. Trouble is. I dont know what that is anymore.
-1	negative	health Confessions	I feel like I deserve nothing friends Confessions
-6	negative	health Confessions	I feel like I'm going through another crisis. It's not as intense as others, because I've been through a lot of crises already. Things just feel reallyunsettled and unsettling. It's one of those moments where everything I thought I knew and was confirmed is suddenly open to argument and up in the air. I'm changing, I get that. But no matter how often it happens, I still can't get used to all of this change. I get used to one set of circumstances, feel cozy, and right away life pulls the rug out from underneath me.
-7	negative	health Confessions	I feel like I only push people away from me rather than draw them close sometimes I just wish that I wasn't who I am, but then again why do I have to strive so hard to be someone I'm not in order to have someone like me, in order to have someone love me Relationships in my opinion are a waste because it's hard for anyone to be themselves cause everyone wants perfection
-2	negative	health Confessions	I feel like time is running out. Life will be over and I won't have had much of one. Please God- help me find the strength to be better. friends Confessions
-1	negative	health Confessions	- I feel lonely. My husband loves me. There is no question about that. I love him too. But I cannot help to feel empty and lonely. Nothing in life is fun or interesting. I hate chit chats and small talks people have to spend the awkward moments. I dont like who I become to hide my feelings of loneliness. I dont like what i see.. I dont like what I do I dont like what I am.. I feel misunderstood. I dream of being on a deserted island quietly. I feel lonely. I feel sad and empty. I feel empty.
-1	negative	health Confessions	i feel practically nothing for any one or any thing unless it affects me in some way. but then i stop and think about how thats pretty much the main part of being social is to gain something from them. but im quite possibly a sociopath without knowing it. but i kind of know it because i suspect it, so does that make me not a sociopath? i have no clue and its been bothering me for sometime. hopefully im not numb to the world. friends Confessions
-21	negative	health Confessions	I feel really alone right now. My girlfriend isnt texting me (i think she is mad at me) and my family is asleep. Im tired and have church at 10 but Im afraid to go to sleep because I have been having bad dreams. last night I was the only person alive in the world and Im walking down the highway. Some of the cars i find are wrecked but I can still tell that they belong to my friends and family. I check for survivers but I just find chard bodies but I can still reckonise them. The other dreams havent that bad but close. I havent told anyone about them, not even my parents or girlfriend, i dont want them to worrie about me and Im deffinatly not going to tell my friends cause I know that some how the whole school (which is like 300 people) is going to find out and the kids will think im crazy and spread more rumers about me. I really hate my school
-10	negative	health Confessions	I feel so alone even as we speak. As we confide in our feelings, tears fall as they weep. I hope and dream of you by my side as we promise day and night. But do I have the right? You do belong to another. You do have a life. I know what's in your sight, but you're unhappy as I am every night. So where is my right to ask you to leave. You know what I desire. All I want is you by my side. I want a good woman like you by my side.
-3	negative	health Confessions	I feel so freaking' horny right now!! I don't know why either!!! I'd give just about anything to make out w/ someone right now.oh manthat would be AWESOME!! I am still a virgin, and am going to stay one til I'm married, but I can still get horny. AAhhhhbasically all I can think about right now is making out with someone, really anyone.is that pathetic or what?? I'm thinking yes
-5	negative	health Confessions	I feel so happy ! I have not felt like this in while hes just so perfect and hes just what i needed. I wake up everyday and I have something that keeps going, something happy to look forward to. I love the way he is and the way he treats me feels so right. I cant stop thinking about him and I want to please him in every way that I can. Sometimes its a pain to think about all the things that I want to do with him and cant do because we are far apart. I wanna feel him, his skin, his warmth, smell his scent, how his hands feel intertwined with mine. I wish i could make him feel my desire for him.. how strong it is. I love you so much baby. Please dont ever leave me.
-4	negative	health Confessions	I feel so little motivation to do anything. I just feel really tired, like there is this big race that I'm a part of and I just don't care about making it to the finish line anymore. I know I'm not supposed to feel like this and I worry that eventually I'll snap out of all of this, but not before I screw up everything I've worked hard for for simple lack of motivation, or laziness, whatever this is.I have a "rising" career as a young professor and a book that I'm working on with an agent. But I don't really care about getting tenure, and I'm totally uninterested in the material I'm teaching my students. I know that I've felt this way for a really long time, but I've more or less stuck because I don't know what else I could do or even what I'd want to do. I don't even care about my book anymore, but so many people have invested their hard work and time and of course my job depends on it as well.Every year I wonder how I survived another year. friends Confessions
-8	negative	health Confessions	i feel so sad, there is no bigger word for me now. i wish i could say i feel depressed but i don't think i can even get myself to say that. i just feel so down, so let down and so sad. i feel that my world has crushed down on me. for so many years i have enjoyed being with friends and now i have none. i have lost my friends. my best friend i have lost because of my husband. he is an alcoholic but he would not admit it. i hate myself for not being strong to stand up to him and to tell him that we should just go on our separate ways. i feel so weak. i am not asking for sympathy. i hate him evere hateytime he gets drunk. don't get me wrong. i like drinking from time to time, i like having a good time. but when we drink together i jkudt don't feel good, because i know what i will be facing. i will be hitting the wall. i will be suspended in hate. pure hate. friends Confessions
-2	negative	health Confessions	I feel trapped. I am in a triangle affair and have fallen for this "taken" person. His look melts me. I long for him so much. I want him daily and yet feel so comfortable with just his smile or touch.
-3	negative	health Confessions	I feel used.  Bitten into.  Chewed up.  Spit out.  Slap on the fannyHe feels good, he says.  I cover my head.  Tears are shed.  I get up.  Dinner is fixed  The tears are not noticed.  I feel used tonight.
-8	negative	health Confessions	I feel utterly horrible right now- I got to meet my ex husbands girlfriend for the first time along with my kids.  He had the nerve to bring her to my childs recital without any of us knowing about it ahead of time!!  He hasn't seen the kids since January too that jerk- also way behind in child support.  He pretty much abandoned us when we were married too.  What does she see in him- he has no money(well that I know of), always has the same clothes on every time I see him, left me homeless with nothing!!!!
-8	negative	health Confessions	I fell in   with someone online but I'm afraid to show him pictures because he wont want me anymore. Now its pretty serious, Im supposed to go see him soon, and I cant bring myself to sow him. Not because Im afriad of being ugly- but because of how hurt he'll be that I lied and kept this from him. I'm so scared, I just want to throw up until I'm skin and bones.
-17	negative	health Confessions	I fell madly in   with you, even though the reason I spoke to you was because I was sad and desperate for help. You told me I was something special, that I would be somebody. I would have lassoed the stars and made a crown for you. I used to dream of your voice, your skin, even your smell. Then you tore at my heart, left me like a broken doll suffering from an emotional gunshot. I'll heal with time but I'll always have a scar. I carry you with me, in my thoughts and dreams. It drives me insane, the thought of becoming anything like you. I hate you so so much but I can't let you go because.I do love you, and it's killing me from the inside. So thanks, you've committed the perfect murder.
-12	negative	health Confessions	I fell totally in   with the most wonderful man and we were together for 20 years, then he died and I found out all the terrible things he had done, he was not the man I thought he was, now my love has turned to hate and he is not here for me to tell him that and how dispicable he was.The sad thing is I miss him but the hate has turned all my memories sour, and I will be on my own for the rest of my life as I could NEVER, EVER trust a man again.
-1	negative	health Confessions	If fat people are gross rate this as GROSS
-7	negative	health Confessions	If I came across a car accident where certain people were either unconcsious or semiconscious, I would most definitely hold a cloth or something over their mouths/nose to ensure that they stop breathing. And if I was able to, I'd stand there for as long as possible to ensure their deaths before calling for help. And if anyone came up to me to ask what I was doing, or if the victim survives and tries to say I was trying to stop them from breathing, I would calmly say "no way.I was trying to stop your bleeding!"
-4	negative	health Confessions	if i had a burner right now id be gone. last night i bought 5grams worth of blow finished it in a night hopeing for a heart explode, if only i can get a burner..blah blah blah life is stupid.

-4	negative	health Confessions	I finally got the end conclusion of never caring about someone again by just finally getting my brain back.I am in the club now tht can say why did I ever like that,Best feeling in a long time.Closure completed check
-5	negative	health Confessions	I find myself attracted to other women when i am in a relationship with my gf. She tells me she loves me and i do the same but i keep thinking how can i really love her when i am attracted to other women. I really care about her and would hate to see her hurt. We have been together for about two years. I dont believe this to be healthy and i dont know what to do or to think.
-4	negative	health Confessions	If I wanted so badly to be with the wrong person, just imagine how much better it will be when the right one comes along
-2	negative	health Confessions	If I was ever really drunk, it would be of dreams with you.  It would be from drinking every last drop of your Soul.   If I'm buzzed I am transported on the night train to another time and another place.

-5	negative	health Confessions	i fooled around with a female client, and the guilt has been killing me.  Everytime i look at my kids, i feel worthless. After 12years, I have never cheated on my wife, but i often thought about it. The worst part is, that I want to go and spend more time with her. I went to church this week and felt hollow. how do i recover?
-2	negative	health Confessions	If someone gets a spare moment would you please just shoot me. Thank you. Much appreciated.
-6	negative	health Confessions	If something bad happens to someone and I dont know what to say or how to be there for them, I tell them "I'll be praying for you". I havent prayed, truly prayed, in years.
-7	negative	health Confessions	If such doctrine like Hellfire, salvation to only a few, strict right wing morals, and authoritarianistic dogma become the norm, we Americans are going to be in big trouble. Our culture is going to become very intolerant. Our Government is going to become very authoritarian. Life in America would be hell if these ideologies became popular. I dont mind being a minority, but I will not be a chastised minority. But seriously, why do we get stuck with the lame religionadvocating Eternal Torture? India gets reincarnation, New Agists get ghosts, Native Americans get cool indigenous beliefs. And yet we get the lame religion, telling us that were dirt deserving of nothing but eternal torment. Stupid religionists. Do people seriously think like this? Or are they just saying it to avoid conflict from bible thumpers?
-8	negative	health Confessions	If there comes no tomorrow and I dont get the opportunity to reveal my true feelings to you just know I love you more than anyone else in this world. No matter how things are, how many walls between us,dont know how many obstacles to clear still I want to gaze in your eyes and whisper in your ears I love you only you". I desire to be in your arms and dream a dream to weave a world of love just you and me. friends Confessions
-10	negative	health Confessions	If we were not estranged right now I would call you up and ask you to go to the city or a harvest market, or even a giant trail to go hiking. Point is I want to see you. I want to spend time doing things, sharing moments. Sober.  I like you just the way you are. You make my heart smile and I feel happier  when we are near each other. I have not had more then one beer at a time since the meeting. I don't want to drink a lot ever again.
-2	negative	health Confessions	If you anivt got friends what do you got? friends Confessions
-3	negative	health Confessions	If you have never been chased by a north american black bear, then you know nothing about the experience and nobody can expect you to. I have never experienced love or happiness (same thing) yet people all expect me to be happy and to understand it.

-2	negative	health Confessions	If you're married and fooling around with other women it's best to make your Facebook profile private otherwise the truth will be known to all parties involved.
-9	negative	health Confessions	If you've never read any of my stories or confessions, I have a mad crush on this guy at work. Well, my one friend feels the need to flirt with and tell me about talking to my crush, even after I've told her repeatedly that it makes me jealous. I wish I wasn't this way but I just am. Same thing goes with my cousin who works with me. I know him and her have ran into eachother at the bar but she has to constantly say stuff just to get me riled up. I don't know how someone can claim they love me then do something deliberately to upset me. I know they're both insecure about themselves, just as I am with myself but if they said they liked someone I would never do that to them. They both have no trouble finding men and my friend has a serious boyfriend so why can't they just let me have my crush? I wish I didn't care but I do.
-4	negative	health Confessions	I gess im not what i seem to be. i always have an agenda behind the things i do, the people i choose to be around or the way i act. its just the way ive always been. al;ways looking for the next big thing. friends Confessions

-2	negative	health Confessions	I go through the self-check out line at the grocery store and ring up organic produce as ordinary produce. So, am I going to hell for this? Maybe - but my life expectancy just got a lot longer. friends Confessions
-17	negative	health Confessions	I got involved with one of my good friends  .It caused alot of problems in the friendship but after several years things have gotten better with my friend.The thing is that   her father is somewhat of a polygamist.I did have knowledge of this prior but I never thought he would try that with me.It was horrible for me. Ihad just had a baby and I was already feeling blue. For about 6 momths I had to share him.She evan ended up in our bed once. I wanted to see how far they would go. She gave him oral sex while i Watched in SHOCK.After that I put into action aplan to get rid of her.It took alot of drama to run her off because she really was willing to stand by him at all cost. Now I have reoccurring nightmares about this woman. In my dreams she is alwayes back.I know my partner would like the stimulation of another partner but I do not know if I could handle the big share. I just had to get that out because things like that u just can not share with all.

-12	negative	health Confessions	i go to an amazing school, have a great family, and a group of supportive caring friends, i should be happy; and i am on the outside. i moved away for a year, and in that time my best friend died, and i should have been there for her. i dont know how much longer i can pretend to be ok, or pretend to not mind going to the school she should have been with me at every single morning. it hurts. and every second im thinking of her. people say it gets better with time, but its not getting easier, and its nearly been 8 months. if anything, its getting harder. i cant talk to people about it; i physically cant. i hate complaining and hate people seeing sorry for me. but cant someone see that the smiles are false? cant someone tell that i dont laugh like i used to? everyone thinks im getting over it, but really, im just getting better and better at hiding it, but the better i get, the more it hurts inside. i need help. soon. please notice.
-4	negative	health Confessions	I got pregnant and read online that overdosing on vitamin C would make you miscarry. I ate vitamin C all night and the next morning I started to get these really bad pains in the shower and I started bleeding alot. I gave birth to a bloody mass of tissue.To this day I feel like i murdered my baby
-20	negative	health Confessions	I got stood up tonight. It makes no sense to me because this guy called me out of the blue telling me that it wasn't his roomate that wanted my number, it was him and that he didn't want to hurt my friends feelings because he thought that she liked him(she doesn't) and that he really wanted it. So we made plans to hang out when i got off of work and he told me to call him. When I called him he didnt answer his phone. So I texted him asking him if he still wanted to hang out and no reply. So I waited awhile and was like well I guess not have a good night. I know I shouldn't be as hurt as I am but secretly I really thought we had hit it off when I met him and that he felt the same. It was confirmed, or so I thought, when he called me out of the blue today. Why would he do that? I don't understand.
-9	negative	health Confessions	I grew up in a happy home with a solid family. Mom dad brother and me. My boyfriend grew up with a young single mom, father took off, mom always yelled and swore at her kids. My boyfriend had numerous "step dads" throughout his childhood. Drugs and alcohol are a common thing in his family. I've been with my boyfriend for 3 years and I'm starting to see red flags(why didn't I see them 3 years ago) I'm starting to wonder if this has any hope of working
-8	negative	health Confessions	I grieve the loss today, the loss of her chance in life. I messed it up so bad. I thought I could.I thought I could. You were once so special to me and now, now you're dead to me. Whatever you were, whatever brilliance you had, I no longer see it. All I see is your hatred. Today is the last day I waste. friends Confessions

-7	negative	health Confessions	I had 4 miscarriages. 2 of them within the past 12 months. The last one happened a few months ago and I didn't go to a doctor. It started with normal bleeding (period-like), but then after a few days got really bad, including a lot of serious pain. Even though I passed out a few times, I never went to the hospital. The bleeding went on for over 5 weeks and I still to this day did not go to see a doctor. I know I have been risking my health and my life.
-16	negative	health Confessions	I had a child at a young age and was forced into getting married, I just started going to college and I have to be with this person for the rest of my life, I wish I hadnt been so stupid, I cant enjoy life anymore, I wasnt ready for this type of commitment. However, I wont leave my family because the values I was taught dont permit that, and I just couldnt face the hatred and emotional damage that leaving them would cause. To make things worse, Ive met another woman, and were just friends but i really like her, but Im married. I know it all sounds really inmature and I sound like a horrible person but I just wish things could be different. Im too young to be in this situation, but I guess I got myself into this

I realised yesterday how old some people are around me my mum reminded me today she is 70, and I looked at my cat and realised she is aging so much.I wanted to cry. I am nearing 40 but inside I feel sometimes younger sometimes old my body is aching however - how did things get this bad. my family and I are so morbidly poor and like indian peasants - can't shake the loss of life or hope. my mum said she has given up thinking she will ever get to travel. I feel that way too. were did we go so wrong? was I too selfish thinking it would all work out? were did my life go? I want to live. I want a life. just not here anymore.

-6	negative	health Confessions	I hate being in  !!! I mean I love the feeling but I hate feeling vulnerable and feeling that at any given moment my love could just leave me if they wanted and I would be extremely depressed!!! I know that we are soul mates but just the thought of not being with that other person makes me cringe. Sometimes when he doesnt text me during lunch or the whole day I start thinking to myself that he doesnt love me anymore or something crazy like that even though I know he does. I just hate love! I see other peoples relationships around me and ive seen how sometimes it doesnt last and that scares me to death because I love this person so much! And even though I love them soo much, other times when I think those crazy thoughts I repeat to myself that Ill get over it, and the whole day I dont call him or text him until he calls me with no clue to what I have been thinking.

-1	negative	health Confessions	I have 5 months clean and sober today!

-12	negative	health Confessions	I have a hallucination problem. These shadows visit me every night, and I freak out everytime I see them. I hyperventilate, cry and pray that they leave me alone. They talk to me in theirhorrible voices that sound like nails on a chalkboard. I scream and scream for help, but no one else sees them. I think that I am going crazy. They say things like 'Why havent you realized yet?'. I think that it is my own mind trying to tell me something. But I am scared that these things will hurt me. Sometimes after they leave, I have cuts on my arms. I am scared of myself. I cry from them. I need help, but I am afraid that they will take me away or something. Put me in a crazy house. I dont know what to do. I am afraid

-9	negative	health Confessions	I have always had too high a threshold for pain, and too much trust in love. I gave faith one more shot. Miracles, soulmated, magic, twin souls. My grief has given my heart the go-ahead: torment that naive girl, make her stop this nonsense once and for all. How many signs does she require to comprehend he neither wants nor needs her? He is doing dandy and all but forgotten her. Let the poor thing mourn only a minute more and then open to something real. She fought hard; let her find one who'll fight for her. See, she is nearly dead. Let her be now.
-9	negative	health Confessions	I have always lived here with my entire family, and I've never had to pay for anything. However, next year I'm gonna move to an art school far from my city, far from anyone I know, all by myself. I have to buy and afford things myself, I have to find a job, and I have to find somewhere to live. I am terrified that I'm going to mess things up, that I won't find the school, that I will be too scared to find a job, that I won't be able to pay for whatever apartment I have to stay in. I know that you won't get anywhere with a negative perspective all from the start, so how in the world will I survive?

I have never felt such strong feelings and never wanted to kiss or hold someone more than I do him and everytime I see him, my feelings double! I haven't actually done anything with him, so don't worry. But I just want.. him to kiss me passionately and have no one else find out about it, like our little passionate, forbidden secret.

(and no it is not edward cullen!)

But I miss him something fierce right now and I know that if I left my house right now I could meet him on his way home from work. I just spent 10 minutes looking at his pictures on facebook. Why do I torture myself? I cannot have him He loves his family. He says he loves me too but God this hurts.

But she recently broke up with her boyfriend, and I think she's interested in - or at least curious about "us". I get mixed signals from her. Some days she keeps her distance, and other days she's quite flirty with me - and I really like it!!! I fantasize all the time about us and I don't know how far I'd really go if given the opportunity, but I'm dying to find out!

I know that there is nothing in his marrige anymore, has not been for a very long time. I know I should get as far as I can from him. I only found out about him being married about a year and a half after we had been dating. By that time, I was lost. I did dump him and spent the next three days crying. I did not cry so hard for my fiance as I did he. I am seeing him again and I feel as though he is a drug and I am sooo addicted

-12	negative	health Confessions	I have been evaluating my life lately and I feel like I am paying for all the times I've harmed and it helps to first get things out off your chest so here is mine.It was about 8 years ago in middle school, there was this kid named Alex (?), he was a weird kid to be honest. But, not a bad guy, just off, like everyone else in their own way. Now-a-days I could see myself talking to him because I've become that weird kid and I hate myself *that's a whole different story though*. I don't know why I did this, but I did, and I regret it to this day because I'm not one to harm anything unless being harmed myself. I was a kid, i dont know. I spat in his face. maybe exchanged a few slurs but I only remember hawking a loogie in his face.I'm sorry Alex (Alexander?)

I WANT A NICE HUSBAND WHO IS SWEET AND LOVING AND RESPONDS WHEN I SPEAK TO HIM!!!!

-6	negative	health Confessions	I have been having an affair for sometime now. I've come to the realization that your heart doesn't control who you fall in love with. My spouse has no idea and I don't plan on ever telling. I know my lover likes me but has never expressed feelings to me; also is single now.
-19	negative	health Confessions	I have been having an affair with a man for 3 months and I have fallen in love with him. We are both married and I can't talk about this with anyone. We see eachother about once a week and sometimes its for several hours and sometimes its for afew minutes. I miss him all the time and wish I could see him every day. I feel like I have found the love of my life, when we're together, he makes me feel good, he gives me what I'm missing in mymarriage. He has 3 small children and he is a very good father. When he does things with his family, I feel very jealous and wish I could be in her shoes. He says he is not in love with his wife anymore and he stays for his children. I have 2 older children and I stay for financial reasons. I need to talk to someone who has been through this or is going through something like this. Sometimes I just want to end it because its an emotional rollercoaster. One day I'm on cloud nine and the next day I'm crying. friends Confessions
-20	negative	health Confessions	I have been having surgeries since i was like 16 or 17 years old.. I'm 22 years old now. My biological mom died of cancer called FAP. Its a rare cancer.Before she died, she wanted to make sure me and my brother had it and we did. Its hard making friends my age because they dont' know what i'm going through. I'm a lesbian and i've been in and out of relationships but I'm in a relationship with this amazing girl, she's 23 years old, she's sweet,loving,caring, gentle, she doesnt judge me and she's a good listener and she understands what i am going through.

-8	negative	health Confessions	I have been lying since i was little, and my therapist says it's because of my past. I've lied saying that my dad abused me (i was in 2nd grade when this happened) I've lied saying that my brother molested and raped me (on two different occasions to different people). I just lie a lot and it hurts because I'm scared of losing everyone once they find out the truth. I was doing good for a little while, but then it started back up again, which has happened multiple times. I don't know what it is, and I don't think it's because I think I need attention I get a lot already. I just don't know what to do.
-5	negative	health Confessions	I have been lying to everyone for the past 6 years. I told everyone that my grandfather had died. That was such a huge mistake. The truth is My father is the one who died He died so young. My grandfather is still alive I just really want to tell someone I know, but if I do, they might hate me.
-14	negative	health Confessions	i have been married for a long time but as time went on i found we were not in love.  Sex stopped over 15 years ago.  I found myself working two jobs so i would not be home.  I then put all my life into my grand kids so i would not be home with my wife.  My wife i think is bi polar and it has really affected the marriage.  I started talking on the internet and found people liked me and we all had fun.  It gave me a will to live again.  My wife and i fight every 5 minutes over nothing and she really get angry.  My doctor says i deserve to be happy..  I would like to leave her but we have been together a long time.

I was constantly having to lie, sneak in urineto pass my drug tests, lying to my counselor, now i can focus on my treatment and what i have to do to stay sober. I'm getting there but boy is it a slow aggonising process!
-6	negative	health Confessions	I have been refusing to put myself out there and meet new people in fear of rejection, and i have reduced my social circle to two people. My best friend and i guy i met online that is potentialy using me in order to get some kind of unknown twisted satisfaction which i wish not to go into detail. . . Feeling low self worth and no one to talk to or no way to vent these emotions i am left in a endless depressing cycle. Though i want to improve and am welling to change, i fear i might fall back into my bad routine like a bad cocaine addict. So this is not so much as a confession as it is a promise to myself.I will love myselfI will be more expressive in some way or formI will put myself out thereI will at least five more friends by the end of the yearAnd i will do this for my self inorder to get my life back.
-6	negative	health Confessions	I have been seeing this girl for 9 months now and I am afraid we moved too quickly. I love spending time with her but deep down inside I know that she is not that one true love. I want to tell her but I hate the thought of losing her friendship. She thinks we are the perfect couple but I know we are not. Unfortunately I cannot see myself growing old together with her. I have never felt this lost before.
-12	negative	health Confessions	I have been sick for a very long time. I was in a cardiac ICU unit two years ago and I did not call my husband. I called my daughter to let her know I wouldn't be home for a while. When my husband came to the hospital we did not speak. He stayed for about 10 minutes and then left. I had a lump removed from my breast last year. I didn't even tell him about it. My daughter drove me home from the surgery. He never even knew. Last week I had a biopsy done and the results came back negative today. I will have to have surgery but I am afraid how he will react when I am out of work for several weeks. My daughter will be here to help me through this but my husband will not even ask me how I am feeling.

-3	negative	health Confessions	I have been thinking about my life and the way things have been going and I have decided that I'm done! I don't want to sleep with my roommates any more, though when I do things between us become better for a time. I also am done pining away for someone who I feel doesn't return my feelings and I doubt would ever appreciate everything I would be willing to share and give them. Finally, I am just so ready to move on to the next step in my life. I am willing to do all that I have to so that I can leave the place where I am and do something on my own. While I'm getting everything off my chest I'm so sick of the lip service everyone has been delivering me. It's gotten to the point where I don't believe anything anyone ever tells me. I need new friends on top of everthing else!
-6	negative	health Confessions	I have been trying to get help. Since i have been going through a rought time and I have been wanting to really talk to someone about everyting. I have told all my close friends about all the * I'm going through, but they think its a good idea to really talk to a psychiatrist. But I don't know where to go and talk to a psychoatrist without my parents knowing. Hopefully I can find one soon.

-22	negative	health Confessions	I have dated good looking guys and not good looking guys, but this guy when i seen him for first time I didn't like him until the point of not even wanting to even kiss him but we were alone and we got hot and we kissed I fell in temptation because It was a long time i didnt feel that passion of having a new person touching me. Time went by and i got used to him, couple months after i had pictures of me and him on fb but my friends started making fun of my pics, some people were cruel ,others would say they are very disappointed  of me. I told them off.. I even lost friends because of the confrontation i had with them then I had to close my fb.. And I didn't care what others said I kept seeing him, I know I am not perfect..

-2	negative	health Confessions	I have figured out the reason I don't want a roomate. It's selfish, but if someone is living in my house I want that person to myself..  Someone I can feel, someone I can be with. That's selfish, but I have come to that conclusion of why I don't want just any 'roommate'.
-2	negative	health Confessions	I have four fears: Firstly, of washing my face and opening my eyes to someone standing behind me. Secondly, of someone/thing chasing me up stairs. Third, I'm scared of getting to my door and fumbling with the keys as someone chases me. Finally, of someone being in the backseat of my car waiting for me.
-8	negative	health Confessions	I have got to confess that I lied to my mom of skipping on school I actually went to my boyfriends house and we were just cuddling but my mom and dad totally disagree with me to have a boyfriend and more that i attend to their houses.
-2	negative	health Confessions	I have learnt.  Never play with people. It brings trouble.
-3	negative	health Confessions	I have lost myself completely. My life that was full of singing and dancing is now replaced with medical supplies and ungrateful patients. I am no longer creative and music can no longer make me feel better. I am alone.
-7	negative	health Confessions	I have my boyfriend, we've been together for 3 years and I have this married guy that I have been messing around with for the past two years. I guess I am that good.
-8	negative	health Confessions	I have never believed in the concept of  , but still i find that i long for it with every fiber of my being.i'm 18 years oldnever been in a relationship, never been in love, never had that feeling that everyone keeps talking about, so somehow, i feel like a huge part of me is missinglike there's a void inside of me.like someone ripped out part of my soul.and it hurts..oh God, it hurts so bad.
-15	negative	health Confessions	I have never had a boyfriend at age 26never partiednever had a group of friends that I can have fun withI been brought up with strict mother.I live my life in my head, through books, etc. I have anxiety, low self confidence, and resistance to anything outside my comfort zone. I feel apathetic and indifference if I died or lived tomorrow. I have strong feelings of anger and hate in my heart. There that's who i really am. If you saw me outside, you would describe me as a normal, quiet, nice girlbut it's all a farce. Why can't we be ourselves in real life? And behind closed doors, like in EP, that's when our masks fall off
-4	negative	health Confessions	I have never had great social skills. Now, I am in high school, and I have about two friends. The worst part is that I have nothing in common with them, and they do not consider me a close friemd. It hurts to be constantly rejected, and I just wish that I could feel happiness in talking with a real friend. Someday, it will happen, I hope.
-2	negative	health Confessions	I have nobody to talk with anymore. The loneliness got the best of me. After a long time of sobriety I started using again. It's the only thing that keeps my mind from thinking too much. I need to get out more.

-1	negative	health Confessions	I have not been leaving my house. Want to go out and do things or visit people but get all anxiety weird and don't go. Just want to walk my dog around the block.
-4	negative	health Confessions	I have not eaten anything since Sunday.  No, I am not anorexic, and I am not overweight.  I do it to punish myself because I am a failure.  I tried so hard to be a good husband and father but it is never enough for them.  I thought marriage was a two-way street.  That was a lie.  Maybe I am hoping she will care, I don't really know myself.  I would cash in my chips but it would destroy my mother.
-3	negative	health Confessions	I haven't all in   with two different people at the same time. I don't like to think that in time I'll be hurting the one I love or he'll be falling for another woman in the end. Loathe the fact that some cheaters uses 'Love" as an excuse. And that they just made a mistake. But in reality, indeed, it is possible.

-3	negative	health Confessions	I haven't had an easy past and have met bad people. Some experiences from my past still make me anxious and unhappy, angry and bitter in the present. I would like to let go but I am reminded of the past all the time. Memories have a tendency to haunt me. I feel like I could be living a much more valuable life if I could only let go of my demons..Any advice?

-1	negative	health Confessions	I have so many things I want to confess.  I feel so dead inside, like anything I do has no impact whatsoever. I feel so small. Just like that song "Dust in the Wind."No, I haven't been smoking potnot recently. But I feel so powerless. So freakin insecure. Like is anyone going to notice me if I'm gone? I don't know. I'm sure that's the only time my husband's going to give me a second look. friends Confessions
-9	negative	health Confessions	I have spent my entire life wanting my   to have a part of it. I haven't seen him in nearly eight years. I didn't even know my grandmother had lung cancer. I heard it through a mutual acquaintance of my uncle. I did get to visit her, but did not find out she died until my brother contacted me. He found out through a facebook message of a friend. What a bunch of losers. My father couldn't call his children. My father has erased my brother and I from his family. When I visited last fall my cousin didn't even know my dad had two older children. He only knew of the three he had with his second wife. How insulting? I don't know. Just venting. I have spent my whole life wanting him in it, and yet he has no interest. I surely need to quit hoping. And let sleeping dogs lie.

All she ever did was love me, I treated her like garbage I regret it all I've cheated on her 24 times. I love her so dearly.

Then say ice cold soul crushing things to both. Got them both to love me. My soul is heavy and tarnished this vessel isn't happy with me. I love the one of 3 years I fooled the other one into thinking I loved her after the birth of the kid and the loss of baby weight. I can't feel anything though.

God everytime I'm around you I want you more. It's not her that makes me want you, it's us! It's you! It's who I am when I'm with you!  Hahaits just like a clishe pop song. Girl meets boy, finds out he has a girlfriend, becomes best friends with him, then falls for him. Haha your stupid girlfriend doesn't even give to ** about you. I do. An I know because.she's my closest friend.  I font even give a *. We're perfect for eachother and I want you so bad that I'll keep having this faith I've been holding onto now for months.
-9	negative	health Confessions	I have wanted to end my life for a long time. But promised myself I would never do that to my kids while they were under 18. My wife is most likely pregnant again so I guess I will live for another 20 yearsish. I have never in my life broken a promise and I wont now. I dont know why I keep letting her talk me into having more kids. We can just barely afford the ones we have. Life is difficult. I almost died from health issues earlier this year, stupid doctors helped turn me around though.damn . I will be an old man before I get to die.

I have hurt a lot of people, At first it was unintentional, but then it became more as a habit.And i met this guy, He was a great guy..he asked me if we could give it a try, I said YES..I don't love him, but he's a sure choice..I'm a hundred percent sure that he would never find the courage to hurt me.And that he would do everything to make me happy.PLUS! i won't deny. I LOVE THE ATTENTION.But Every time, He looks at me with his big brown eyes and tells me how me he loves me.I feel ashamed.. Because i couldn't even tell him that i feel the same, because i don't.The weird part is, I don't want to let him go.Guess I'm afraid that somehow i would never find another man who would treat me like he treats me.YES! I'm a self-centered b*I would not even try to justify myself.

I have lived my WHOLE LIFE being degraded, abused, mistreated, rejected, and discriminated against by christians.  Many of my friends have gone through the same thing.  I feel badly about it, because I try so hard to be tolerant of everyone, and if I had the chance, yeah, I'd fight to make sure that the christians there had equal rightsbut all I could think when I read that post was, "GOOD."

-12	negative	health Confessions	I keep   about a guy I took things way too fast with,(backstory) I lost my virginity to him and we said we would be together forever and everything just felt right then he broke up with me through text and said we just took things way too fast. That happened 6 months ago. But at least three nights in a row I've dreamt about him. I've dreamt about getting back with him, about me talking to his friends about wanting to try again, about being around him. I know subconsciously that I do want to try things again with him, and to slow it down. There will always be a place in my heart for him. I just dont know if he feels the same way. He moved away just for the summer, so that forces me to give it more time, which is probably a good thing. HELP.
-1	negative	health Confessions	I keep walls around my heart. If a man is willing to take the time to tear them down then he deserves my love. I would love with all of me.
-8	negative	health Confessions	I keyed a car quite badly yesterday all down the length of one side. I've never done that before. Only it was more serious than that because it was a brand new Porsche and it belongs to my sick in the head, satanic ** of a boss who dances in the blood of puppies and small children. I heard her complaining about it this morning and my only regret is not sticking around to * on her windscreen! Feeling very empowered! :D

But I wish that just for a night I could have you all to my self, and show you a bit of fun. You have made me laugh a thousand times here on confessions and I would like to give you some just payback in the form of the pleasures of my body (as I am not very funny). I just wanted you to know that a young lady out here has admired you from afar, and dreamed now and again of sharing a long night of passion with you. Thanks for all the laughs. Let me know through confessions if there is any way I can ever pay you back. xxxxx
-4	negative	health Confessions	I know you haven't seen me in months or heard from in a week, but I am thinking about you. I have read all your confessions and I'm sorry for not responding. I have been busy. No need for Fb to know where I stand with you. Know that Imiss everything about you and that I love you.
-10	negative	health Confessions	I know you lied about where you went? When you started acting funny I checked to make sure I wasn't crazy! I didn't have a thought in my mind not to trust you. What is going on? The not knowing is worse than actually knowing. I already know if I ask you, you will lie. If I tell you how I know you will just make up an excuse. I will still know your lying but you will look me in my eyes and do it anyway.
-1	negative	health Confessions	I know you like to f uck other men.    Can't say I'm surprised.

-7	negative	health Confessions	I know you're not talking to me, but there is someone in my life who just might say something like that to me, and here are my answers: I don't miss you. Yes, I am hurting. I have nothing to say sorry for. And no, I'm not okay, but it's not about you.
-2	negative	health Confessions	I know your with someone elsebut I'm still in love with you. Your beautiful blue eyes. Yes it's meand yesI'll always feel this way about you.
-20	negative	health Confessions	I know you still wonder why I did what I did? I was trying to teach you a lesson, over the years I notice how you used women as s$$ objects . You will tell them and make them feel special and as soon you gottired or found some other girl you dump them and jump to another. You never been faithful to any women and felt sick to my stomach just to think another human being can be so selfish and so I though not realising how much harm I was doing. I'm sorry for lying to you and pretending that I cared when all I wanted was just to teach you how it feels to be betrayed and lie to. I guess we were each others karmas in the process you made me look at myself and that's when I realised how much of a hyprocate I was. Now I hope you understand why we can never be "friends" not even in cyberspace. and btw don't worry or feel guilty for ant bs and fabricated lie created in here, I never believe any bs written here, I was just playing along like everybody else so no need to feel bad.
-19	negative	health Confessions	I know you've been talking to her for months now. I know about every call made on your phone and hers, every minute you stayed on the phone, and everyday a call was made. You made more calls to her than she did to you! and you say you love me? I know everything about her, her address, her full name, birth date, I've even driven by her house a few times. I have the phone records so I cannot believe anything you say about your relationship. I have even read the e mails and although you deleted the most recent one, I know what that was all about. Her pictures weren't even cute. They say when you go looking for stuff you find it and get hurt. I can't help it, i want be the fly on your wall.  I'm in love w/a liar 
-10	negative	health Confessions	I laid in my bed today and was going to take a nap. But I didn't take a nap, instead I laid down and just cried. I'm tired of sleeping in an empty bed.I know it's been a long time since I broke up with my ex, but I'm missing him again. I want to find love again, but it is so hard. And it isn't like I don't try. I don't want to sleep in an empty bed anymore. I want to be held again, and kissed again. I want to be embraced.I know I am so emotionally fragile. I know that it's hard for me to trust sometimes.But I feel this longing. this need to find a mate. This need to find love again.But at the same time, I know I am a special person. A special person with special needs and special wants and emotional desires. I know that finding what I need is very hard for me. I need a kind, understanding person; someone who can accept me for who I am, and be involved with my emotional needs.This bed is just too cold. This hole needs filled once more.

Now nothing has changed but the scenery. At first we kept talking but I told her that only makes it harder because I'm so far away. I made her cry and I feel awful about it, who knows maybe I'll move back in a week or a month but I won't tell her that until I do, now I want her back but I can't undo what I did, and I'm still so far away

And I'll never get to know my mom, because my mom is an alcoholic. and I bet when she was young, she never saw it coming.
-7	negative	health Confessions	I look at your perfect happy family picture everyday. I am happy for you and for her. It reminds me that NOW is the time for me to move on.It gives me the force to face reality. A lesson learnt; there is no such thing called true love, soul mates and happy endings.True love is but a fantasy.
-2	negative	health Confessions	I lost a relationship with my ex for some crush and now that I know my crush likes me I don't want him. funny Confessions
-14	negative	health Confessions	I lost both my legs when I was ten years old. My right leg, right below the knee and my left leg right above. I was in the car with my big brother, Tomas driving, he was sixteen at the time, he wasn't paying attention to the road, he was yelling at me and my twin brother, Chance to stop fighting in the back seat. That was when he heard honking and saw we were about to crash. He veered off the road and the car rolled. Both him and Chance walked away with bruises, cuts and concussions. But I was pinned inside the car, they had to use the jaws of life to get me out. They amputated my right leg on the scene, my other leg was burnt severely and neither could be saved. Even now, sometimes I lay on my bed, without my prosthetic legs and look at my stumps. Sometimes I can feel the pain of my legs as if they were still there. It comes and goes, even five years later. And sometimes I don't want it to go. I want to feel connected to my legs still. Is that weird?
-16	negative	health Confessions	I lost my mum a long time ago now, for the longest time I just missed her, I was sad. I wasn t that young, but I wasn t that old.I missed what she did for me, I missed how she made me feel. I missed her so much I couldn t even tell you what it was I missed about her, just her.No I realise it is the everyday things I miss the most about her, cooking with her or for her, having a look around the shops. buying groceries together. Just having a chat. That feeling of family, that feeling of belonging. That is what I miss the most.Most people my age want to go out, party drinkI like or would like to sit at home with my mum and have a chat and watch the tv. It s that close warm cosy feeling that I miss. The one that you completely take for granted and bores you silly when you have it.I don t really like clubs, and drinking and empty superficial emotionally dull ways of life anymoreguess I m just boring. And that is how I like it.

-11	negative	health Confessions	I loved you, I really did.The times we spend together, seems like a distant memory to me now.All the times we would cuddle, laugh, cry, love and every bitter-sweet moments seem to slowly dissolve.I guess it really was just us growing apart.Me with my independence and you with your ambitions.I guess we really weren't meant to be.As of right now, I don't love you anymore.I don't know if you feel the same way as I do.But, I just hope that one day.When the time is right,That we can look back at the moments that we've had together.And maybe ask ourselves, "Where did our love go?"

I'm addicted to weed, tobacco and alcohol, i've lost my virginity due to alcohol, I broke my foot from falling down a hill and nearly all my friends have started ignoring me because they cant be bothered to help me if i need it. I have 5 different 19+ year olds asking me for sex and I wont but if they flirt enough i am afraid i might fall for them. i am falling out more and more with my mum and now cant stand my grandma and I REALLY need more independence. If i had more independence i feel it would help towards quitting my addictions and pulling my life together. xx friends Confessions
-11	negative	health Confessions	I`m 167cm tall and I weight little less then 50 killogrames. My parents and my friends think that my weight is normal,healthy and they also think that I look good. But, there is one problem inside me I think that I`n fat. Everytime I eat a candy, I say to myself : ,,You stupid pig, that will make you fat!``  I`m a professional volleyball player and I have trainngs 5 times at week, plus games. But, that is not enough for me. I do some extra push-ups, I do jogging, I dance I am sad and never happy Recently, my mother noticed that and she had a loooong conversation with me about that. Unfortunatly, that don`t have any effect.
-11	negative	health Confessions	I'm 19 years old and I'm a closeted lesbian. I experimented with  girls before I ever messed with guys. I am and have always been attracted to girls. But I grew up in the church and my entire life have been told what I am feeling What I am Is wrong. I got to college but I still go back to my mom's during break. If she knew that I truly like girls and wasn't just "going through a phase", I wouldn't be allowed to go back. I'd be an outcast in my home town. I just want to know if any one else has/ had a problem with the whole church thing
-7	negative	health Confessions	I'm 19 years old and my   is terribly controlling my life.If I go out (which I do rarely because she won't let me) she will call me every 30 minutes to check where, with who I am, what I am drinking or eating and so on.Whenever a guy that is not even my friend talks to me, my mother thinks that it's my boyfriend and starts insulting me by calling me a liar and so on. To avoid this psychological shock I decided to ignore all guys , absolutely all And guess what My mother still makes up stories about imaginary guys of mine.So yeah. 19 years old with no life.

-10	negative	health Confessions	I'm 27 with 2 kids ages 6 and 5. I've been with the same man since I was 17; married since I was 20. We lost a home to a house fire in 2008;followed by the birth of our 3rd child who passed away when he was 2 months. I'm a stay at home mom and now I feel like I'm struggling to hold my head above the depression and anxiety that constantlyoverwhelmme. Reba McEntire's song Is there Life Out There feels like my theme song but sometimes it just seems like it would be easier to walk away from everything and disappear. I love my kids and husband dearly but ifeel like there is nothing left for me. I'm so empty sometimes i curl up and just cry. i don't know what i'm doing here anymore.
-10	negative	health Confessions	I'm 27 years old and I have $37,000 in credit card debt and $100,000 in student loans. I've cancelled most of my credit cards and the ones I still have I only use in times of emergencies. I also owe several friends money. I am still in graduate school and my cash will be completely out by the end of April. I work part-time but the pay barely covers my rent. The job market still looks very bleak but I've started apply for full-time work for the summer. I am so sick and tired of being perpetually broke and in debt.
-13	negative	health Confessions	I'm 29 and about to turn 30 in a few months. I have no job and it sucks. I was given money from an old co-worker for my car insurance. I had a job interview that went well but they chose someone with more experience.I hate when people say don't settle for less maybe I'm meant for less in life. I'm re-tooling my resume and inmproving my typing skills b/c I need a job and I want a job where I learn new things even if the job at the same time becomes repetive. i'M BORED OUT OF MY MIND. Oh and I still live with my folks. I never planned anything I had ideas not goals or plans. I found an old list from four years ago that said my goal was to move out by 2007. Here I sit three years later at my moms' house. Oh vey I hate it! I should stop my complaining get off my  and apply for every job I'm hafway qualified for b/c I'm an awesome person and worth more.
-9	negative	health Confessions	im 2O years old and ive never been kissed, , gone on a date , got asked on a date, never been told they like me or im interested. ive never been in a relationship not even close. basically ive never had a boyfriend. i honestly don know whats wrong with mecause i know im not ugly and def not overweight. i mean ive seen far worse looking people than me who have found someone to call theirs. the being single doesnt bother me so much ..its the lonelyness that kills me is killing me. and the feeling of not having someone to share your life with. i just fear that i will end up old and alone. that i will never find someone or that no one will ever be ineterested in me. I hope to get married and have kids one day..but that just seems so impossible. ive just about lost hope.
-8	negative	health Confessions	I'm 31 years old. I never been a relationship. I've been alone my whole life. Every time I try, I've gotten rejected or pushed away. Or in this last case, it's just not possible. All my friends love me and I love them. I've been there for them through thick and thin. I'm always the one that makes everyone smile and the one that's there to pick you up when you're down. Now, I can't do this for myself. I feel so horrible and lonely. I just don't want to be lonely anymore. What did I ever do to anyone to deserve this? I'm not perfect, but I'm a good person. What am I doing wrong?
-2	negative	health Confessions	im35 and never been out on a date never been kissed never told i love you

-8	negative	health Confessions	I'm about to enter completely new territory It's exciting. It's what I've wanted for a long time, but it seems I had to pass some tests before I could get here. I've conquered bad habits and ways, I've moved on from people who were no good for me. It's going to be a new dawn, a new day, and a new life for me.
-1	negative	health Confessions	I'm about to have a friend with benefits and am so happy about it. We're both married to other people. friends Confessions
-15	negative	health Confessions	I'm about to start a new venture, and I am frightened. Scared. Physically scared. So scared, and no one understands. Anyone I try to talk to wants to give me the practical advice I already know, or discounts the emotions that are based only on past fears, not rational thought. They see me as an accomplished adult. I'm not. I'm a 5 year old with separation anxiety who has never had anyone to talk to my whole life. Well, I had one person, but that was a therapist, and that ended several years ago. I used to be able to talk to my spouse, but he is pretty unavailable, and has been for, well, many, many years. I have no one who gets it. How bad does the need and the fright have to be for me to broadcast it out into the web to a universe of strangers?I have no one here for me in my deepest need, no one who will just understand the depth of my fear, or where it comes from, or why I have been so lonely, or troubled, or stuck down a deep well.
-2	negative	health Confessions	I made a few mistakes by drinking too much in the past and getting taken advantage of. Guess isn't ra .pe if I didn't say no even if I couldny stand and was passed out  Mostly love but things happened to me on a few occasions.
-15	negative	health Confessions	I made a horrible mistake by falling in   with a married man. He made me feel special for awhile but soon realized how selfish and sef centered he really was. I heard all the typical, I cannot leave her, we have been together so long, its because of the kids etc. He dumped me so many times and never once had the courage to do it in person. He tells me he loves me and yet his action show me he does not. I really hate how I let him use me. I know I was wrong to fall in love with him because he belonged to someone else. I paid dearly for my indescretion. I lost so much because of it. I learned a valuable lesson from this experience and will never allow this to happen again. I know I was vulnerable and weak and now i am broken hearted and alone. He gave me nothing in return for all the love and affection I poured into him.
-3	negative	health Confessions	I'm afraid of being single for the rest of my life. Nothing ever seems to work out for me. I'm 17 and I have never been in a relationship. There I said it. It's not that there haven't been any guys It's just that any guy who has ever been interested on me I've just been so turned off them and then the guys I like either don't like me back or don't do anything about it and when I do something about it I mess it up! I always told myself it's ok because I'm young there'll be someone but I feel like I'm missing out on the teenage lovestory that grandparents tell their grandchildren about  I guess there's always collage but I still feel like I'm missing out here..
-9	negative	health Confessions	I'm afraid of going over other peoples houses because I hate being put in environments that im unaware of. I get tense, and become the most socially awkward person you'll ever meet in your entire life. I go from being some loud, obnoxious, open 17 year old to  someone who's stuck inside a shell. I'm petrified of what people will think of me, because I have this mind set that nobody likes me or I get judged everywhere I go. That's why I won't go over other peoples houses Lord have mercy upon me when I have meet my boyfriends family.
-2	negative	health Confessions	I'm afraid of the dark, inside and outside idk why, I feel like a baby :| I honestly would tell anyone I know it real life.
-2	negative	health Confessions	I'm a girl and I have just been friend zoned it isn't the best feeling either
-11	negative	health Confessions	I'm a girl who's recently moved to a new town, and I found a really great music store. There's a guy working there that I was attracted to and starting to become infatuated with. I'm incredibly shy, so every time I'd go there and he'd be working, I would just sift through the music trying to think of something to say to him.I'm not happy with myself about this, but when I learned what his name was, I did a little Facebook creeping. I learned he has a girlfriend. Normally, when I find a guy I like is taken, I'm okay with moving on. I understand that since I don't know him, I shouldn't be upset, but I'm a bit distraught. I mean, rather than thinking "OK, that ship has sailed," my mindset is, "Oh no, what do I do." I need to find some other guy, right? Maybe one I can actually talk to without feeling like an idiot and doesn't have a girlfriend?
-1	negative	health Confessions	I'm a girl with hemmorhoids that have dropped out. I'm afraid to get intimate with anyone because of this. I don't want surgery because they don't hurt and the surgery scares me.

-1	negative	health Confessions	I makeends meet byselling my used panties to men on craigslist, sometimes I worry for my life but I work 2 jobs and barely make enough money to live. I hate it.
-6	negative	health Confessions	I'm almost begging for the numbness to come back. Maybe a little self-destructing will even feel better. 2 steps forward, 5 steps back. How bout I just accelerate the process and just let myself fall completely? Again? For good? I feel myself ceasing to care even for those reasons that have until now held me together. I swore I wouldn't go back to this place. I may never have left. The numb is back.
-1	negative	health Confessions	I'm alone in the universe.

Was happy to spend my life with you..  I know you werenhatingnmemfor loving you thoughmhe he.. Sorry. Couldn't help it
-8	negative	health Confessions	I'm avoiding going to bed because I know I'm going to toss and turn for an hour before I finally fall asleep. It's 4 am, and I'm still not sleepy at all. I'm beginning to wonder if something's wrong because this has been happening for a few days now. It's just that when I try to get to sleep, I feel really restless and I can't sleep. I hate this. I want to sleep, and I think I'm sleepy, but I can't go to dreamland. Also, these days, when I do finally fall asleep, I have very vivid dreams. Which means, I'm having REM sleep (deep sleep). So, if I do have REM sleep everyday (and I even remember my dreams), why is it so hard to fall asleep in the first place? I don't think I'm conflicted about anything (or maybe I am subconsciously), but I don't know. All I know is, I totally hate this.

-13	negative	health Confessions	I'm becoming a despo. I've become too desperate now. I can't handle being single anymore.I'm a 15 year old guy. Never had a girlfriend. Countless attempts to get one, failed at all of them. There's something about me that keeps girls away. I just can't figure that out. I've always been good with girls. ALWAYS. I've had some very close attempts, but in the end the girl always leaves, or friendzones me. "You're a really nice guy, and I hope you'll find a girl better than me."I've been getting dreams, nightmares. This desperation is growing inside me. There's something about having a girlfriend that attracts me toward having one.I don't know how to do it right. I can't get a girl above a "good friend".There's this loneliness in me. I need that loneliness to be filled."Till I look at my hands and feel sad 
-7	negative	health Confessions	Im being observed tomorrow, on how I teach spelling. It's only for 15 minutes, but it's doing my head in! My class are really bright and I know they'll get it, we've been learning about prefixes and suffexis since last half term Argggggggggggggghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
-5	negative	health Confessions	I'm cooking too much for dinner tonight on purpose so I'll have something to take to my internship for lunch tomorrow. Otherwise, somebody who is buying take-out will ask me if I want anything and I can't say "no" because I want to fit in with the employees.I can't afford to keep buying lunch. So my alternative is to bring leftovers that smell delicious and attract comments in order to fit in more.
-9	negative	health Confessions	I'm crying alone in my room.. again. I have him, and I know he loves me. But I feel like for him to be with me he'd have to give up everything to be with me. He's seen worse. I know.. I want him happy..and wonder if I am good enough. I wish he was here.. Long distance.. age difference.. worth it? Without a doubt.

-4	negative	health Confessions	I met an amazing guy, he was sweet, and he cared about me a lot. However, I realized I didn't want to be with him in the long run, or forever. He hates me, won't talk to me and I lost one of my best friends. I wish he could forgive me.

We used to chat day in day out. My wife never realised that. This relationship lasted for six months. I felt guilty thereafter and had to break off. I still remmeber her and the good times that we had. She got engaged and I think she will get married as well. I dont really understand what would i have done.

-3	negative	health Confessions	I'm feeling overwhelmed. I don't know how this is all going to happen. I don't know how the chips will fall. Sometimes, I enjoy the suspense of life and that, at any turn, you never really know what comes next. But when it's something as life-changing and somewhat life-determining as this, it's terribly anxiety-provoking. I already feel like the odds are stacked against me. My past is affecting my present. I don't want for it to, and I don't think it should, but it is and there's no way around it.
-6	negative	health Confessions	I'm feeling quite depressed and alone right nowbut, I'm too scared of being seen as a pathetic failure to ask anyone for help.I try to throw indicators out but the only time I can actually say something is after a drink, which may be starting me off on a drinking problem.I need help.

They've got a one track mind. The normal ones they haven't figured themselves out yet so in a moment of crisis, you don't know what they're going to do. The most average of you could kust slip right over the edge one at a time.

How can I tell you and how many time do I have to tell you that I love you and you to believe me ! ? I have loved you for more than a year and from the very first day I seen you.! Not because I don't talk to you or because I don't show it . Doesn't mean I stopped loving you or that I have never loved you. I have - I do - I will always.  I'm sorry for loving you. For being in love with you .. Is that a sin ? funny Confessions

-1	negative	health Confessions	I miss her so much!  I feel a part of my heart is missing and she's the only person to fill it upwith her love!  :o(
-4	negative	health Confessions	I miss my ex-boyfriend. He's now with another girl, and that breaks my heart. And I hate to admit this, but I feel he's going to come back to me. And despite all we've been through, I would take him back. I sometimes apply the principals of the law of attraction to that, even though I know that's not right.
-14	negative	health Confessions	I miss my grandmother so much. She left us 4 years ago but i can still remember the funeral and everything like it happened this year. my birthday's coming up, i don't care if anyone remembers, but i know that she does. She'd call me every year just to wish me a happy birthday and tell me that she was one of the few that cared enough to tell me personally. God i miss her so much, i'm crying right now just thinking about her, listening to one of her favorite songs, Ave Maria. This Christmas is depressing me so bad, i wish it could just end, it's not the same and i know a lot pf people that are really sad this year. God bless all of them. May God be able to bless everyone in time for the holidays.

-6	negative	health Confessions	I mix the truth with outright lies.I lie about everything, to protect myselfbut from what?Now, to some people, I point out personal and secret truths to them, often to humiliate them and make them aware of how much I know. But, other times, I flat out lie. And I repeat my lies over and over, hoping they'll be mistaken as one of the truths.I lie even about small things, like if someone asks me if I've seen a movie or what my favorite song isI'm an expert at lyingI like to distract people from thinking.from figuring out who I am. 
-4	negative	health Confessions	im jobhunting and yet i feel bad more not having a job. i want to cry right now. lord help me. pease dont beat on me, dont beat on me! dont beat on me!!!
-2	negative	health Confessions	I'm just a pathetic little mental patient. My   is the only family I have. My sister hasn't called me in weeks. When I complain to her that she never calls me she says she's been busy. I feel so sad sometimes!!
-3	negative	health Confessions	I'm just really really tired. After the last 6 years all these mind games I play on myself have caught up to me and now I'm physically drained as well. For the last year or so every day has been a rollercoaster of emotions. And 9 times out of 10 I end up calling my mother 2-4 times a day to tell her how much it sucks. It's not really comforting though since she deals with the same thing. I just cannot stand trying to try anymore. I feel emotionally blunted. Like I only feel extremes and nothing in between.
-4	negative	health Confessions	I'm kind of the same way. I didn't grow up rich and I'm still a poor *, but I don't really care much for/about other people and don't understand or care about their problems. My response is generally "ohthat sucks" and I think "it doesn't have anything to do with me, so I don't care."  Somebody could be in front of me crying that their baby died and I'd probably just put on a concerned act, give them the usual "I'm so sorry" when in reality, I'm just happy to have my kids safe and alive. I also feel really uncomfortable around crying people and want to get up and leave.  Call me ignorant, evil, an icy **, but that's the way I feel about tragedies.  There are times when I think there may be something wrong with me. I am capable of feeling emotion, I do cryjust not about things like that.
-8	negative	health Confessions	I'm leaving soon and i just want you to know that i'm going to miss you! Don't worry, while i'm gone i will only be thinking about you, exactly the same way i have thought about you for almost 3 years now. I truly love you and i hope that when i get back we can finally be together.
-3	negative	health Confessions	I'm lonely I wish I hadn't mad the mistakes that I have made in the past that have caused me to end up single today.I learned a hard lesson from them and pay a heavy price today. 
-1	negative	health Confessions	I'm losing my job and my boyfriend. Life is reali
-3	negative	health Confessions	I'm lying to everyone I care about. I still engage in my eating disorder almost daily. I am not okay.
-1	negative	health Confessions	Im mad because my new boyfriend says he cant spend everyday with me. Am I overreacting? he has been single for two years and is probably used to having his space, but then why start a relationship with me? He is very sweet and treats me good but maybe I should leave him if he cant give me the attention i want?
-1	negative	health Confessions	im madly in   with you and every second im not with yuo is killing me
-19	negative	health Confessions	I'm married with 4 children and for the past 4 years I've been having an affair. He wasn't married when it started, but 2 years into it, he married her. He has yet to spend an anniversary with her. As a matter of fact, we went to Florida together last year during their anniversary. It was the most amazing time I've ever had and I can't get that memory out of my head. My husband found out about him, but didn't blow a nut?!?! I even left my husband for about 6 months hoping he would follow me, but he stayed with her. He's never told me he loves me.  You would think that would tell me something. After every encounter I say that it's the last time. . . I'm done. And then a few weeks later I'm right back there with him. Deep in my heart I know he's just using me. . . and it hurts.
-1	negative	health Confessions	I'm no beauty queen! I'm just beautiful me!
-5	negative	health Confessions	i'm not allowed to see him anymore and i was going to kiss him last time i saw him but i chickened out. now my parents won't let me see him. but if i had another chance to, i'd kiss him with no hesitation. that's my confession. i love him.
-12	negative	health Confessions	I'm not exactly the BRAVEST person on earth, and my self esteem is lower than an archaebacteria, and I have a nack for wellhating myself, with a passion.But today wasn't the bestof manyI brought my rifle home today, and through school, today in lunch i was playing with it, and tossing it (i'm in colorguard, with band and stuff?) and everyone around me was egging me on to drop it, and they started throwing acorns at me (i was outside) then this boy, who'se not very nice, told me i was a rifle **..which confused me, butyou know.that's what insults doyeah, everyone around me was making fun of me, and then some popular chick came ut to watch me and i dropped it infront of her, and yeahwasn't exactly the best of dayslike i said.~Destiny
-3	negative	health Confessions	I'm not gay.I'm not handicap.I'm not poor.I haven't announced the difficulties of my life.I have not had to overcome 'against all odds' odds.I have not had any life threatening illnesses andI have not conquered major physical feats.Yes, I am nothing special.I am just invisible and do not matter.
-7	negative	health Confessions	I'm not happy, and its taken a long time for me to figure out that it is the people in my life that are making me so unhappy. They drain me of energy, and of emotion and I just want to be rid of them all. My life is too short and my time too precious to be dealing with people who drive me to sit alone in a dark room with the door locked pretending to be asleep. I have to go somewhere I can be free, where people don't know who I am and I can just live in peace. I'm just so tired of my people
-1	negative	health Confessions	I'm not hungry at all since I let you go. I have zero hunger.
-2	negative	health Confessions	I'm not into women but damn your hot ! Debs a lucky woman ! If I was into women I'd wanna be your Deb , your one hot mama ! You go girl ! friends Confessions
-1	negative	health Confessions	I'm not okay. I have strange thoughts. I don't know where my life is going anymore. I have trouble concentrating. I'm ready to ask for help. I don't want to go into a dark place.
-3	negative	health Confessions	im not skinny enough and you i think im not cute enough this is mehttp://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=137503569649146&set=a.101198536612983.1701.100001685104554&type=1&theater
-14	negative	health Confessions	im not sure what to think. my wife is talking to her old crush from high school. she wants to visit the guy alone this summer. my wife has already fell in love with 2 guys in last 2 years. If she visits this guy alone, this relationship is over. we have finally got our relationship going in the right direction and there goes another  interfering with it. sometimes i wish my wife just wake up and see what she is doing to me. she doesnt know i know everything bout her and her  x lover boys.i should have left months ago. i feel like im wasting my time.screw this. there is another woman for me. a woman that wouldnt treat me like meat on a rack.hmm all this * will pile up and im throwing it right back into her face one day.
-5	negative	health Confessions	I'm not that dumb and it's not a coincidence. I'm not doing anything for the class because I'm wondering if the entire thing is phony or if it's real, but you're using it as a way to get to me. How about you come clean now instead of making this more complicated.
-1	negative	health Confessions	I'm not the only one having a breakdown.trying not to drink, lately, but I needed some beer to get me through this monster of a nightI'm sure there's gonna be some interesting stuff on this board for the next couple hoursyou know who to blame.
-3	negative	health Confessions	i'm obsessed over a guy i humiliated myself in front of several times.  i can't function around him now without feeling embarassed and vulnerable.  i have to willingly avoid a potential good friendship bc i'm so self conscious.
-3	negative	health Confessions	I'm okay with a few misspellings. I get it. It's a natural mistake to mis-type something. But some spelling and grammar errors I keep seeing drive me up the wall! Why the hell are you capitalizing random words in the middle of your sentence like This and This? Use a space after punctuation please. I just don't know if it's illiteracy or laziness that's responsible for all these silly grammatical errors and misspellings.The real reason why it's annoying to read all these crazy mistakes is because I don't want to lose memory of how proper grammar and spelling is supposed to look. If there's any reason to read, it's to restore your grasp on the English language.
-5	negative	health Confessions	I'm one of those people who seem crooked or full of * but I'm honestly I'm the kind of person youd want your kids to babysit. I have no real hidden intent and im an honest hardworking person. People often assume the opposite of me and pick me apart. I'll admit I have an eating disorder even though it doesnt show on my body I have a problem with not eating. I always think im gaining weight bc i used to be so skinny but the reality was i never thought about anything besides not eating and i may have been better looking but i wasnt even a person with thoughts outside of being pretty. Id rather be a little chubbier and less appealing and actually have a mind that isnt starved of nourishment to the point where all i can do is sleep.
-4	negative	health Confessions	I'm only 15 but I have already decided I want to be in medicine, but I want to do dentistry aswell. So confused on which to choose

-1	negative	health Confessions	I'm real, everyone else around me is fake, and it's probably because I can't stand the realness they have to offer, so they are fake.
-13	negative	health Confessions	I'm really embarrassed by this, but I have to shave my faceA LOT. And unfortunately, I forget a lot. This morning was the first time I noticed myfacial had grown in again. It was so thick. It's normally just a thin line of hair on the bottom of my chin/top of my neck. But this time it was turning into an actual beard. I also have some upper lip and sideburns. I haven't cared about my sideburns because I thought it was just hair that was too short to go behind my ear. But then I realized it was actually attached to my face and only guys are supposed to have them. But today, I decided that I'm not going through this again. I shaved my upper lip, chin, and sideburns. I'm going to remember to check my face for hair every morning and shave it right then. I'm mortified to think who all noticed my facial hair.
-7	negative	health Confessions	I'm really good at getting what I want.. It just kinda happens for me. I'm also, very patientI find it comes in handy to act like you don't give a * then catch them off guard. Just wait till college. I'm very convincing, and you know it. Why else would you go to such lengths to keep me away from you. Haha, I think somebody's hidind from their feelings. Be they small or notthey're still there. I intend to play on them. I'd say good luck but let's be honestyou've got no chance. As for her.. I'll apologise. I won't mean it, but neither you nor her will know how insencere it is. After all.. "I never meant for this to happen, I would never want to come between you guys." I'm an 'innocent' little ** aren't I? Oh and by the way. tick tock tick tock.
-2	negative	health Confessions	I'm really petrified about my soon to be fianc going into the navy. I love him and I want to support him but I can't help but to feel selfish and wanting him to stay. But no matter what he does I'll be there.

I'm sending an awed stare at how beautifully cute you are. And I'm sending you a hug, though you won't feel it yet. I'm sending a memory, ao you won't forget. I'll give you all I have.

-7	negative	health Confessions	im sitting across from his ex girlfriend and his new born baby (5 days old) and all i can think about is how much i love him. How much i miss him and the times we had together. He told me the other night he loves me and wishes he could be with me. I LOVE YOU!
-7	negative	health Confessions	I'm sitting here tonight completely obsessed with what my body has transformed into. i used to be so skinny and it was effortless and now I feel like I just keep gaining and gaining weight and I have no control over it. I hate what I see when I look in the mirror. Who is this girl with the fat roles all over her stomach? When did I get like this? How did I allow myself to get here? I'm gross.
-5	negative	health Confessions	I'm sleeping with my boss.  he's 30+ years older than me.  He's leaving his partner.  I think he's seeing too much into this, he's a great guy but I don't want to actually date him.  My mother would kill me if I bought him home!
-3	negative	health Confessions	I'm so completely happy for my godfather. He's one of the oldest survivors of cystic fibrosis and just got the news that he can go in for his (long-awaited) double lung transplant!!! I love him to pieces and know that this is a new day for him! HURRAY!!
-3	negative	health Confessions	I'm so desperate for friends that while im laying in bed, italk to my cieling, pretending its a group of friends. sometiems, i even text myself to talk things out, becasue i literally have no one i can tell my problems to, except for my phone and cieling, apparently. and on top of that, im pretty sure i have split personalities. Awesome.
-2	negative	health Confessions	I'm so f**king tired of everything right now. The economy, my dysfunctional family, and my lousy job; its all too much.Don't know where or how I can get some peace,rest or hope for tomorrow. Don't know where to turn. The regular alternatives are drying up. Can't just get another job like in the past. Family thrives on dysfunction and tearing each other down. I'm tired of trying to stay positive and pretending like everything is alright. Just tired of the same ole thing each day.
-2	negative	health Confessions	im so incredibly lonely. i wish she would talk to me.
-4	negative	health Confessions	I'm so mad that my   posted on a public site was read by people I know!!!! how dare they!!! I feel sooo betrayed. My life is OVER! friends Confessions

-3	negative	health Confessions	I'm sorry i hurt you. I'm sorry themedicationcouldn't control me. I'm sorry i couldn't control myself. I was a little kid my mind was already so confused and the world was so big and messed up. icouldn'tmy anger and i lashed out at you. Now when i see the scars on your back it pains me. to know that i causedthat.It makes me feel disgusting.I love you big brother and i'm so sorry.
-16	negative	health Confessions	I'm sorry. I'm sorry. How could I have ever lied to you? I want to see you, I want to touch you. So badly. Talking to each other everyday ISN'T ENOUGH. You just HAVE to be over seas. Right? HaI lied to protect myself, and now i'm just hurting myself because I fell for you. The urge to speak to you day after day, even if it's in text. I love you. I think. I hope. If this isn't love. Then what is? You're only my mind at every spare moment I get. Maybe I just fell for what you stood for? I don't know. But I care so much about you, soStay. I'll continue lying to protect you.

You know I love him though, I know you love me too. I love you too, just not in the way you want. You have no idea how much you mean to me. You love, you let me know. Because I love you, I'm letting you goGoodbye. friends Confessions
-6	negative	health Confessions	I'm sorry that I've betrrayed you in my imagination.I'm sorry that I go solo more often because I need variety.I'm sorry that I can't tell you these things. Sorry thatmonogamyis so difficult for me.I want to do this, I want to marry you. I love you, and I am soooo happy with you.If you knew I would never be able to apologize enough for my dirty thoughts, thoughts that will never be acted on but I know you would never look at me the same.I'm just going to continue to apologize to myself and strangers until one day our marriage falls apart, or we're old enough to not care to think about it anymore.
-12	negative	health Confessions	I'm standing at the edge of a yawning expanse, with everything I have done both good and bad equally irrelevant and behind me now. At first you were a lifeline in a sea of mediocrity; an angelic voice above the clamouring of the unwashed sinners. I clung to you desperately although I wouldn't have dared admit it at the time. Now I can't picturelife before you. Knowing you has expanded the breadth of my experience. You've exposed me to soberingrealities as well as delicious vice. Even as our hurting hearts have made liars of us both, the truth of our loveexplodes the conventions and machinations of those who would be our judges. When I'm with you, I can laugh at the world. So to you, my dark goddess, I pray let me worship in your temple Allow me to lay down at your altar and drink deeply of your love until I am drunk, then drown me in your sweet depths falling forever in your arms, lost in a reflection of myself
-8	negative	health Confessions	I'm still in   with my ex fiancee. I can't stop thinking of him not to mention he was a big part of my life for two years. But we broke up due to the fact I needed to get my life together after being in debt and drinking abuse. The thing is though we were madly in love and he was the love of my life. After I dumped him, he emailed me a bunch of times along with calling me. I've tried to contact him and no luck so far. I don't know what to do. Can someone help please?
-1	negative	health Confessions	I'm such an ugly, worthless piece of crapp. :3
-5	negative	health Confessions	I'm sure there are many lovely people who are also lawyers. But most of the lawyers I've worked with have been rude, arrogant, with huge egos, and seem to lack normal social skills. Is it just me or is this common?
-5	negative	health Confessions	I'm terrified, honestly.  It's taken for granted that everyone will fall in love and that it'll all be grand, but will it really? What does being in love feel like? Will I know? Will it be unrequited? Is it fast? Is it slow? Do I just realize out of nowhere that I live and breathe for this person? Is it that powerful? Will I be disappointed by love?
-10	negative	health Confessions	I'm terrified of 3 little words, "I   you".I've been hurt so many times by people that say they love me. Boyfriends, "best friends", my fatherthe list goes on. And they have all told me that they love me only to abandon me when I need them the most.The only people who are always there for me, my mom, stepdad & brotherI can't remember the last time they said itbut I know they really do love me.Now everytime I hear those words I brace myself for the emotional smack downthe day they look at me and say you're not enough.I'm 28I want to marry and start a family but how do I do that with this in they wayI've been alone for over 2 years
-4	negative	health Confessions	I'm the only one keeping an eye on her, I told her parents but they don't seem bothered by it. She hasn't really got any friends so I'm the only one talking to her and stopping her when she tries. But, while I never would, a part of me just wants to let her and be free from this. friends Confessions
-8	negative	health Confessions	I'm thinking about you. I'm wishing you were here with me so we could kiss and cuddle. Just the thought of you next to me turns me on, your body next to mine for me to touch and lick all over. And your hair down so I can smell it and play with it as I kiss you. I want to hold you all morning, all day, as long as you'd let me. I'm so in love with you.
-7	negative	health Confessions	 im thinking abut deleting my account asap. my reasons for this is because im always being bullied, no one really talks to me, no one really likes me, and im always ignored. so i think i should go 
-1	negative	health Confessions	I'm tired of loving you. But I cant stop
-14	negative	health Confessions	I'm trying so hard to not talk to my ex tonight. He's started seeing someone new and we had agreed that we could remain friends if we didn't talk about other people or relationship stuff. But he broke that agreement last night and told me somethings about his new relationship and it made me want to vomit. It's hard enough to still be in love and know he's with someone else but I was working on accepting it, but to hear about it I just can't take it. So I am struggling to make it through the day without talking to him.That might sound silly but we talk everyday and it's just really hard. I could use someencouragement.
-4	negative	health Confessions	I'm trying to start a business that casts an image of wanting to help others but in actuality, all I want to do is take your time and money for myself.
-17	negative	health Confessions	I must be a deadbeat  ! I haven't seen my daughter in a month and my deep depression is driving me insane! I used to tell myself I can't let her (my daughter) see me like this, she's only 3 years old. But really its me that can't bare to see her while I feel like this! Her perfect smile reminds me that I am doing nothing for her. I quit my job to follow my wife and I have been unemployed for months in a different city. I haven't been paying my child support and the bills are racking up. I miss her so much. I have allowed my wife to pretty much control me and take over my life. She claimed she wanted to take care of me and would take care of me, but allowing her to has been a strain on our relationship. We have been married a year and because she is financially well off, she feels as though she wears the pants. I put myself in this situation by allowing her to take over everything and I am regretting it now.  I THINK I WANT A DIVORCE! I WANT TO START OVER..

-4	negative	health Confessions	I'm with someone I don't even want to be with. The only reason I'm with him is because he likes me. I'm afraid to break up with him because it wll hurt him. Badly. I don't even want a relationship right now because I have yet to figure myself out. This has gone on for a month no w. I feel like a bad person.
-6	negative	health Confessions	I'm wondering if my kitten is outdoor or indoor? Whichever she is I'd like to keep her that way so she's happy. I found her outside but whenever I let her out she mainly stays in my front yard and just frolics for a bit. Once I go inside she stands outside my door and meows and scratches and wants to come inside almost like a dog hah. I'm not really sure what to do
-4	negative	health Confessions	I'm working on my   giving it my all and it's gotten better but I still cannot get this other man out of my head . I want him like I haven't wanted another in many many years . I won't cheat but it's hard dealing with these feelings . I've been avoiding him but ..
-9	negative	health Confessions	im worried my husband cheats on me and when i really think about it i dont think i could ever bring my self to leave him unless he was like physically abusing me which hes not although two weeks before our wedding 3 years ago he punched me in the arm in a fight and gave me a really bad bruis which he laught at 2 days later and i didn't leave him then. i feel weak when it comes to him sometimes i wonder if he really loves me or if he just loves the fact that he has me to take care of his kids and give him sex whenever he wants. i find myself doing things that i normally would never consider (sexually) to keep him interested.

-1	negative	health Confessions	I   my girlfriend.. I mean really love her.. But I have to be really careful around her sometimes, she has a short fuse and can be manipulative and I hate pussyfooting around her should I talk to her about it? and whenever she's on the phone I have to be extremely quiet or walk out of the room cause she doesn't want some of her friends knowing about me I'm getting sick of it and I just don't know what to do I don't want to dump her
-3	negative	health Confessions	I   my husband but have cheated so many times. I think I have been in love with thisother man since I was 18. the other man is a loser compared to my husband- I feel like Sharon Stone in Casino who cant drop that loser I feel destined to be torn, and a liar- and cant stop myself. Each time I say no more- and every time I go back
-5	negative	health Confessions	I   my husband but I don't know how to get what my nieces said about him out of my head. I believe him, but its just hard at times, I think what if they were telling the truth and i putting my daughter at risk. I just don't know what to think or how to move past this problem.
-8	negative	health Confessions	I'm your average sized 15 year old. I often go on a website with amazing clothing which I would love to buy in the future (at the moment, parents won't let me because it's online), but everytime I go on, all I see is these skinny models who rock any type of clothing. I, on the other hand, cannot. Everytime I see them, it makes me feel all depressed and makes me want to go excersize myself to the bone, literatly.
-1	negative	health Confessions	In all my life, i never saw a girl more beautiful than me . Yet
-10	negative	health Confessions	In between the pages  of my well read book, I found a memory of you. I always knew it was there, but In the middle of nowhere I saw a little flower waiting for the sun, and I've been wondering why? I remember a long time ago when the sun came out  to shine.and I was happy, that's when I was happy. Baby, to me you will always be.beautiful, and in my head trying to make sense of a maze and then I'm crazy. I'm a little crazy, baby. How can I tell you what's on my mind?

-7	negative	health Confessions	I need help. I'm starting to lose control again. Too much is happening at once, it's dragging me down. One part of me is screaming out "get a f#cking grip, b#tch you can handle this!" and the other half is crying out: "just end it, it's never gonna get better it only gets worse for people like you, you aren't strong enough." I want both parts of me to just stfu. This is the part where I'm supposed to go into shutdown mode to keep from doing something stupid, but something is wrong with the fail safe switch. I think it's malfunctioned. NOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!
-1	negative	health Confessions	I need more attention from you but I don't want you to think I dislike how we are right now. I seriously love you and it's starting to hurt.
-3	negative	health Confessions	I need someone to help from from my burdens from time to time, someone to give me a day of rest, I am tired. If I pay someone to help, pay to go anywhere, my burdens increase ten fold. I must move on. I cannot leave my family homeless, I cannot plan my future, I cannot change my job, I cannot make relatives move or care, I cannot change schedules or workloads, on a on, but I cannot make my physical body take much more!! I need to rest, but my family and my survivial depend on my getting up and continuing to move. God please, I am crying out, give me strength!!!!!
-5	negative	health Confessions	I need to know what I should have done that night instead of what I did. The route I took was of desperation but also generosiity; leading to the biggest event of my life: sacrificing everything for love. I want to go back to that night and just go to bed so these last few years never happened at all.
-1	negative	health Confessions	i need to vent. i feel alone and want to run away.right now my depression is rising and the pain in my body is horrible , but even with anxitiy i think i going to leave soon i cant stop hurting.

-13	negative	health Confessions	I never like going to school because I was always being picked on. Just because I was shy made me a target for other boys to ridicule me. I always felt something bad was going to be done to me when I least expected it. The teacher was waiting for me to hand her my exam and left as soon as I turned it in. I was packing my things when this boys came into the classroom and locked the door. They began making fun of me in front of the four girls that were with them. They put me over the teacher's desk and pulled down my pants and undeware so those girls could see me naked. I could sleep that night thinking how embarrassing it was going to be the next day in school. I was so embarrassed that I din't dare to say anything about it, but everyone in school knew what they did to me.
-4	negative	health Confessions	i never meant to hurt you if i did, im hurting myself..i love you and think you don't. if its who i think you are let me know the next time we meet. just tell me you feel the same.

-10	negative	health Confessions	In our class there are 19 people. And my Pe teacher gave us a quiz on football without explaining anything. I was sooooo mad cause there are only 7 people who understand football and the rest got C's And F's. He told me tootalk to the guys who know football and they told me to quote- I'll tell you later- unquote and they never told me. I got a 8/20 on my test! What should I do??!?!?!?!?!?

-12	negative	health Confessions	I now know that I don't ever want you back. I now see you for who you really are. I miss what you represented, but I now know that if we were ever to get back together it would be as it was before. I loved who I thought you were, and what could have been between us, but it was never meant to be, you weren't one of the good guys. I thought you were the one, but you're so not. The one is still out there for me, somewhere. friends Confessions
-6	negative	health Confessions	Insecurities break my heart.   How in God's name can you believe that? I love you and these words are meant to help you see.if you think that as you have thought I had someone before, there Is something wrong with your thinking.   This is outrageously wrong.
-8	negative	health Confessions	Inside I am so jealous, feel horrible because I want my ex to want me back.  I am going to see him soon and maybe even his new girlfriend.  What is the best way to act around them????  Should I just act really nice??? Should I say things like- I am so happy for u?  Will putting up a front like I don't care make him want me back?
-1	negative	health Confessions	 Instead I'm neglected most of the time and starved for love, affection, and touch.  My husband is a selfish jerk and I'm the moron who married him I've been so loving, so affectionate, such a dedicated and devoted wife for so long and have barely gotten anything back for all I've given him.  I just wish I never married him.  Fighting so hard for love and affection from someone it should come easily from is getting less and less worth it and just making me feel more and more pathetic and alone.  friends Confessions
-7	negative	health Confessions	In the morning I would go on saying "I moved on, finally", but at night he occupies my mind. I think of the things we've done together and the conversations we shared, the joyrides in the middle of the night and the kisses in the kitchen while he cooked. I don't cry anymore. I only hear the sound of my heart breaking.
-1	negative	health Confessions	In the quiet corners of my mind,i am always thinking of you.Its horrible.
-1	negative	health Confessions	..in ur sadness close ur eyes and  tomorrow will b better..in sadness,in darkness someone will listen and see but u just close ur eyes and sleep..hide in ur dreamsgoodnight and sweet dreams*
-5	negative	health Confessions	I often ask myself is this all there is? If so whats the point? I cant imagine a life so devoid of passion as my own. I dont want to spend everyday of my life doing something that makes me feel like a drone. I dont want to feel guilty about my contribution to the downfall of society by eating meat, or driving a car. I dont want to subscribe to the belief that I have to do certain things to be considered beautiful. Part of me thinks that I am a lesbian. I have only ever had unfulfilling relationships with men emotionally and physically. But isnt being gay something you just know? I think I am just searching for something to explain why I always feel as though something is wrong with me
-11	negative	health Confessions	I often check out my boyfriend's Myspace/Facebook page to see if he's flirting with other girls. He has chick friend who calls him "my love" when he's clearly mine :-(  I guess I get jealous easily but ummI wonder if his friendship with her is serious.  I hope he's not cheating on me with her.. HATE when girls interfere, grrrrrrr.

-6	negative	health Confessions	I only thought he made me happy, but is was just an illusion. He turned my world upside down. Showed me what love really was. Showed me that Alli had ever known of love wasn't. Then he took my world right from beneath my feet. I then realized it. How was he able to just turn around and walk away in the blink of an eye. Must have all been an illusion.
-1	negative	health Confessions	I only want you for Christmas, baby I don't need nothing else I only want you for Christmas, baby Tie a ribbon 'round yourself Oh, tie a ribbon 'round yourself
-2	negative	health Confessions	I overplay my health issues so that I'm sure people believe that I'm actually injured, sick, etc. Now, in the end, I feel guilty, as if I've lead them on. And as if I've somehow lead myself on, convincing myself in the end that I'm worse off than I am.
-3	negative	health Confessions	I passed my Writing 90 Class! It felt so good to. I am going to be taking  Writing 115 next Month. I am so happy to be able to do that. It will be good for me to do. I  am so happy that I can write for the rest of my life. crime Confessions
-5	negative	health Confessions	I picked my nose and wiped a green boogar on a blue anon person and then they bit me. Every now and then I also turn blue and nobody knows who I am.
-13	negative	health Confessions	I pooped in a fast food restaurant bathroom for over an hour with no paper on the seat having a conversation with a fat guy next to me pooping  Me and him made very many Groans and screeches  And the worst part is the side stall door was broken so we were seeing each other pooping and our facial expressions me and him both were explaining our favorite poop in grave detail. We even finished at the same time but I had to go for round two right as I was pulling up my pants then he said why not he pulled his pants back down and tried to push a whole nother turd and we takes for an nother 5 minutes
-3	negative	health Confessions	I popped 9 vicodin last night. I never thought I'd follow my moms path of drug and alcohol abuse, but now it seems more realistic.
-7	negative	health Confessions	I prayed you would wash away, far away; never to be seen again.And I begged the tree, the big one, to fall on her house and wipe out those drains on society.Surprisingly, both my pastor and my therapist smiled and said they hoped for the same.Yes.Yes, you and your ilk are THAT evil. funny Confessions
-12	negative	health Confessions	I pray & hope that this is not my husband.  This is one of my biggest fear is losing the one I love, but at the same time I wouldn't want my husband to be unhappy at all, all I ask from him is his honesty & loyalty, that's not to much, is it?  I love him so much that I would never ever be disloyal to him, but i love him enough to set him free to be happy too.. Honesty,  ill respect you more,  and ill understand but plz don't do me wrong behind my back. That's the worst betrayal ever friends Confessions
-3	negative	health Confessions	I probably belong in a mental hospital. If I go too long (like 5 or 6 hours) without talking to my boyfriend I start freaking out and I tell myself that he probably doesn't love me anymore, and if he knew this he would think that without question. I'm always wondering if people actually love me and care about me, or if they say they do just so they don't hurt my feelings (which is why I don't tell many people I have depression).
-3	negative	health Confessions	I promised myself for a year ago that I would never cut myself again I just broke that promise. And I don't feel bad about it. When things goes bad in my life I dont know anymore how to handel it so I cause myself pain.

-6	negative	health Confessions	I ran to the bathroom to go boom boom, i mean literally RAN i rushed so fast i didnt turn on the light sooooooooooo i sat down and let it all go realizedi left the toliet cover down fml friends Confessions
-1	negative	health Confessions	I read about articles where men and women can't stand their spouse, and feel it was different for us Had we had the chance to cohabit, or a normal relationship, things would have been so much different Those spouses took for granted what they had each day I didn't even get that chance Yet, when we did, utter heavenly blissThe way our future would have been had we got the chance to get there But We never really got to have a relationship though, did we? Not a real one. Not a real go. And it was over before it even began.
-7	negative	health Confessions	I read confessions in hopes that one might be from you to me that you would say something only I would know to know that it is you sending out a message to me.
-2	negative	health Confessions	I realized tonight that i am lame and I don't like myself much. I got in trouble for bad judgement at work. I'm just useless. Awkward too.
-1	negative	health Confessions	I really couldn't tell you why Im so upset right now. Why I am feeling so hurt and abandoned or even why I am battling to even bring myself to reply to your messages. And on top of all of it I'm feeling guilty as hell because of it.
-5	negative	health Confessions	I really don't know what to do, we have been together for 4 1/2 years and have always gotten along great. I want to spend the rest of my life with her, but now everything is different. I found out through a friend that she has been seeing someone else behind my back. I just have to decide how to address it, and then decide if it is worth staying. We have never had a huge fight, sure there have been differences but always talked it out and became closer.
-18	negative	health Confessions	I really don't like when people think I'm helpless. I'm not. I've lived alone. I've been there, done that. But they still treat me like am some sort of newborn kitten! I'm not. I'm a girl. I can take care of myself. I had for years. I'm not weak. I'm not stupid. I'm not helpless. It makes me wonder if I was a boy if people would respect me. Or at least if I looked tough. Does a 4'7" tall girl wearing pink really seem all that tough? No. That's why I wear black. Even then I look weak. I'm not. I swear I'm not. And when people think I am incapable, I try to prove them wrong. Have I done alright? No. I need to do better.
-1	negative	health Confessions	I really don't want to end up at that depressing place  Not because of myself it's because of the people around me, I want somebody to stop me! before it gets too late, I belong to theexperienceproject not thesuicideproject (I'm not kidding there is really another website called thesuicideproject, if you think i'm joking go find it yourself and trust me when i say it a depressing place) I haven't logged in there for over a year and I have horrible experiences in the days I used to go on there  I feel like an idiot for complaining about such thing.. I had to say that. sorry.

And no more love confessions. You broke up the fukker doesn't love you get over it. People are fukking irritating mabye I ought to be stoned for this.
-12	negative	health Confessions	I really hate it that my neices boyfriend of 10 years is still free and she is dead.She died over a year ago and I think constantly how this man gets to walk free why her kids suffer the loss of their mom,my sister her daughter,and the rest of us a wonderful family member.He does not care about the kids either they were in the same accident she was in being hurt seriously he was doped up the whole time kids were hospitalized only coming to see them twice when his mom made him for about 5 minutes each time.He is a contributing factor in her death when he cut the seatbelts out of the truck she was driving.He only wants these kids now to support his drug and alcohol habit.Where and when is Ky.state laws going to change this guy has been arrested so many times its not funny.Where is justice for my neice Rebecca and her kids ??Kentucky change your laws.
-3	negative	health Confessions	I really hate my life, everyone I meet treats me like I'm ancient because I'm over 30 and anyone my age I meet doesn't want to even talk
-8	negative	health Confessions	I really   him.i cud not tell it to him.i am sure he loves me..he is my well wished.he always tried to improve me..whenever he comes near me..I really got erotic..but he never shows interest in ladies..even he doesn't have lady friends in facebook..I really love him.he is my dream hubby . Hey..guys how can he b so silent
-8	negative	health Confessions	I really like him. I'm not saying I'm in love with him or anything, but I do like him more than I usually like guys I meet. But I'm terrified to make a move. It's not a big deal, right? Say I make a move, and he rejects me. No big. Yeah, big deal, actually. I've been scared away from ever making a move, and people just don't seem to understand that. Other girls don't get constant rejection, but I do, and maybe I just don't want to get hurt again. Maybe I'm not strong enough to handle it, I know I'm not. Instead, all I can do is look at him from afar, wishing that my luck was different and I could actually be with someone I like for once. I've had my three strikes of rejections, or more like five or six strikes, so enough is enough. This is one guy that won't have the chance to reject me cruelly like the others.
-3	negative	health Confessions	I really like you, but I'm afraid to tell my father about you and that I just might be falling in love with you. You're black, I'm white. They would disown me. This terrifies me, but I want you. You make me so happy
-4	negative	health Confessions	I really miss you too much.There is no one who misses you more than ME! Hide my tears when I say your name, but the pain in my heart is still the same.
-2	negative	health Confessions	i really want a boyfriend who will   me for who i am
-1	negative	health Confessions	I really want to be peed on!!
-9	negative	health Confessions	I really want to get rid of my dad. Not that I dun love him but he has made himself a pest to everyone. He kick my brother out of the house over nothing, made my mum work like hell, made my mentallity unstable.  He don't agree he's wrong even if the whole world think he is. Whoever said or commented he is wrong will be his enemy for life. He lie, hates, curses and swears. He is not faithful to his family too I want him gone more than ever. Better for one and himself too. He puts the blame on others except himself. He never listens if you are not praising or helping him. He only care for himself.  I know it is wrong to think this way but what he did is too much to the extreme. What can I do???
-11	negative	health Confessions	I really wish I wasn't here.  I stay in my room by myself almost all the time.  I'm tired of the abuse, the addicts, the users, the liars.  It's safer.  Have gotten to the point that I don't enjoy life.  I don't see things changing.  But if I left, no one would take care of my dogs.  They have been here for me through the dark times, like when I got through advanced cancer. I wish I could find some hope, some caring, some love.  I can't.  My own child just takes from me.  Then threatens to leave home if I don't comply with demands.  My family is full of addicts and abusers.   I'm on meds and I have a counselor.  Even so, it is still this bad.  I see no hope. Is anyone out there happy?  How do you find kind and loving people to be with?  I'm not looking for a spouse, just friends who care.
-1	negative	health Confessions	I really wish my husband would just show me some kind of affection 
-10	negative	health Confessions	I reallydon'tknow whether I have been able to really tap the potential of myself.I have an inner feeling that I have not fully explored the untapped potential of my own personality.My intelligence, competence and wisdom has not been properly utilized in my life.Still I can do lot of things butdon'thave the right opportunity. My basic grief is that I have not been able to now find the correct thing to do after having wasted lots of golden opportunities to improve and upgrade my self .The problem is also that Idon'tknow whether all this is true or not.At one hand I feel that my competence isunderutilized. I also feel that every one else in life is superior to me in every aspect. I reallydon'tknow where I stand in life.Successful or a failure.Idon'treally know how to assess the performance in life .How to rate oneself in career and life .What are the basic parameters on which I can say whether I am successful or not. friends Confessions

-1	negative	health Confessions	I refuse to believe I matter that much to you. I'm not buying that one. I know that much.
-12	negative	health Confessions	I relized I am very competitive. If I am going to get a new phone a need the one that everyone wants. I use to live in Arizona not to long ago and right now there is not enough jobs for everyone. I happened to not be affected by this and I just NEEDED to live in a big, fancy house just to have the best. I relized this sickness also affects me when I am playing computer games. When other players are a higher 'level' I need to be a higher 'level' than that person. When 'Silly Bands' where the big thing, I convinced my parents to bring me to multiple stores and spent about 100 dollars on them. Yes, I do in fact, relize that I am spoiled. Honestly, I don't even think it could be called 'competitive' anymore. The correct word would be, spoiled or a brat.  Also, believe me, my life is not perfect.  P.S Please give me advice to end this horrible way of life.
-9	negative	health Confessions	I remember in middle school and high school when I had the most amazing friends ever!But now, I have no one.It's like everyone has moved on. Everyone is in college or moving to other states for job opportunities and some even getting married.

She feels sorry for him since both his marriages failed and he has to give most of his money to support two kids who aren't even biologically his. He hates his dead-end job and has a weird family. He was abused when he was little and still has a sick relationship with his mother. My wife is his only friend and I understand jews like to stick together, but my friends think this guy is really crossing the line. He writes about my wife on some lame blog and has a history of wanting to get back at "macho" guys who bullied him. Should I keep ignoring this or rip the guy a new one? Oh, he's gay, too, and likes young guys. friends Confessions
-4	negative	health Confessions	is a fantasy, and I want to be loved. So tonight, for the first time since last summer I am going to go out with an open heart and open mind. When a man looks my way I will not turn my gaze, I will look single because I am. I am single.

-5	negative	health Confessions	I saw a glimpse of you this morning while you were out riding your bike. It was brief enough for me to realize that I still love you, and I'll always love you.
-7	negative	health Confessions	Is a waste of time, like everyone else believing in them or what they say is rather pointless. 2 vacations planned, been threw many a person in here's town. Not once did so much as going for a coffee or a walk happen. If I'm gonna be this disappointed it may as well be with real life people
-5	negative	health Confessions	I saw my   everywhereRevealed at times, hidden somePossible at times, obligatory someSaw you mortal at times, timeless someHe is a king on a throne somewhere,At places a beggar with a silver bowlHe is a well-dressed lover at times,Saw him without vanity someI saw my love everywhereRevealed at times, hidden some
-14	negative	health Confessions	I saw the happy family pictures you posted on __. Happiness lies in family, friends, loved ones and you have it.True love is when happiness of another person is essential to your own.I should be happy for you.But I am not. I am choking  A snap back to reality. I did get my hopes up too high. maybe I was way over my head. Maybe I am the stupid one for ever thinking that we will be together again.I cried a billion tears when I let you go last time.I will cry a centillion more today.Why does it hurt so much?Maybe cause I never let you go though I pretended I did. But in the back of my mind,I thought you will need me someday.Insanely held on to this thought.Can't see you cry.Can't let you see me cry either.I'm sitting here trying my hardest to walk away. Not cause I don't want to see you.Cause I am convinced that if I look at you, you won't be looking back.

-6	negative	health Confessions	I say those mean things because I think I would succumb to you so easily and that makes me more nervous than I've ever been to think that you have a better control on me than myselfdamn it
-7	negative	health Confessions	I secretly   of you proposing to me. All this time weve spent together has been amazing and I fall in love with you more and more every new day. And, when you tell me that you love me, my heart beats just a little faster even after weve been together for this long. Oh my dear love, please say those words to me.
-19	negative	health Confessions	I secretly wish that my husband would leave me. I love him so much but it's one of those cases where we are much better apart. Maybe it's one of those "He's an Aries, I'm an Aries" sort of things but deep inside I know he resents me. I took away his bachelor days and now he sees his friends on the other side of the fence and can't go and "play".   I wish he would see me the way I am. I'm not a mean person. I cook and clean. I watch our child. I sleep with him whenever he wants it. What am I doing wrong? Is it my body? My hair? My teeth? God, I don't know what is wrong.  Please, for the sake of my son, let my husband grow into the man I know he is. I love him so much but there is only so much a person can take. I don't hate him, but I fear that I will end up resenting the way he behaves and treats me and my son.
-1	negative	health Confessions	I seems to have move on I'm really so happy..
-5	negative	health Confessions	I see Teacher tomorrow and I'm gonna have to tell her I SI'd the other day. And I'm gonna get a scolding. Worst part is, she won't be at all mean. She'll be firm and fairand make it clear that hitting myself is NOT an acceptable way to handle difficult emotions. She'll then offer me other ways to cope; kind of a "back to the drawing board" thing. For all the positive-ness she's still gonna be dissappointed. That's not the confession part. The confession is this: I'm reeeeeally tempted to lie to her. I probably won't.but I want to lie, or just not mention the incident. I wanna sweep it under the rug and not tell so I don't have to be reprimanded. I'm bad. friends Confessions
-12	negative	health Confessions	I see that youre not perfect. Im not perfect either, really. But I wonder if you dislike me in the slightest. For if you do, I think I would feel the weight of a thousand rejection letters on my heart. I want to know you better, love you more than I love you now, which seems so impossible to me since I love you more than any person Ive ever had a feeling for. I try not to push it, but its hard not to look your way. Dont judge me if its hard for me to talk, because I have a timidity that takes hold of my throat and sucks in my words. Just please, dont hate me or find me annoying because Im really trying to not be like that at all.
-9	negative	health Confessions	I see you in that playground at age 12, awkward and chubby. I want to hug you and tell you not to worry. Hard times are ahead. But life is full of possibilities. You are so young and I wish you had the benefit of my years, your older self.If I were 50 now and not 33, this would be my letter to me now:"Do not stay with your husband. You are existing in an unhappy and unfulfilled marriage. Take the chance and life will turn out fine."You will meet someone who loves you. You will get that spark back once you make the leap."It will never happen for you as long as you linger where you are unhappy." friends Confessions
-3	negative	health Confessions	I see you so clearly at times. The events of your day, the depth of your words, all cultivate apicturesquememory that reminds me of the person you truly are. The softness of your voice, your timid touch, I sense. I feel. I embrace it all. Sometimes you give those hints of hurts, and wrongs you have endured. I stand by you during those trials, although you may perceive I'm far from it all. I am right here, my friend, my partner. Close your eyes, and you'll feel my touch on the small of your back, encouraging you forward, accepting your deeds, relishing in your actions. I am never apart, you will see.
-9	negative	health Confessions	I self medicate so I dont have to deal with anything or anyone. I dont like looking forward to days. Everyday I wake up its an instant regret. Anything that can put me in a relaxed state and to sleep I will take it. I dont pop pills to get high. I like to sleep.I do it so I can sleep because I cant stand my own reality. Its constantly drives me crazy and I dont know to cope with any of it. I have no reason to have my eyes open to begin with. I have no purpose. No one needs me so why not. I just hope that one day I take enough so I never wake up again.
-6	negative	health Confessions	I should be dead.  My heart keeps beating.  I want to be dead.  I was used to pain.  Just not what you dish out. And you wont stop. Every single little minute each with 60 seconds are all has been potential lost.  Along with them, hope. This isnt funny.  It diesnt matter ever if I do or do not tell the police. You think you wont be figured out. This is no way to treat another human being.
-2	negative	health Confessions	i   showing off my back with my hair all let loose.. wearing a saree with all of my hair hanging loose at my back and when a guy looks at me i sometimes feel like showing off my smooth deep back i do it intentionally to tease men hehe the helpless look at their faces gives me a real kick.. lol.. am too harsh on them i know.. but i love it..
-21	negative	health Confessions	"I shut my eyes and all the world drops dead; I lift my lids and all is born again. (I think I made you up inside my head.) The stars go waltzing out in blue and red, And arbitrary blackness gallops in: I shut my eyes and all the world drops dead. I dreamed that you bewitched me into bed And sung me moon-struck, kissed me quite insane. (I think I made you up inside my head.) God topples from the sky, hell's fires fade: Exit seraphim and Satan's men: I shut my eyes and all the world drops dead. I fancied you'd return the way you said, But I grow old and I forget your name. (I think I made you up inside my head.) I should have loved a thunderbird instead; At least when spring comes they roar back again. I shut my eyes and all the world drops dead. (I think I made you up inside my head.)"
-6	negative	health Confessions	isif that person truly loves you and you think you are not good enough cause you think they can find someone better, then,  you're missing the whole point of what love is. Shame on you!!

-1	negative	health Confessions	Is it all right if I play every woman on EP? They all seem so innocent and naive..
-7	negative	health Confessions	I sit alone in my room sometimes, and hear the silence. The void that used to be so full of life is now dead. I no longer believe in God. I always thought He was there, but looking back I realize this is not the case. He was never there to begin with. It was hard at first, but slowly the pain has lifted, and I am now comfortable with the silence. We must make the best of everyday because that is all anyone really has. What if today was your last day of existence? Go out and live life to the fullest.
-11	negative	health Confessions	Is it me or my property Management made that room smells worse? it even smell badder then me coming home from work and washing my Butt with a Tooth Brush.But in the bright side, I wanna thank God for Answering my prayer about those bad Influence friends to come pick me up and hope for them to never call me. well Today I was feeling really lonely so I wasn't sure if I want to come visit them, that's pretty much the only friends I have and maybe to take control of myself to come for a Visit but without smoking Pot and party what we use to do. I call them and they have no money to pick me up.Now that's a Blessing, that's one of the better prayers than any reasons for needs. Now I know that I'm not alone and Jesus is always there with me.
-6	negative	health Confessions	Is it wrong to not think abt u. We have pictures posted up everywhere. I try to convince myself that ur just out of town. But the reality is ur really gone. I find myself crying at the oddest time. Oh how much i miss u. Nothing but my tears can explain it. Ur my big brother, my protector my support, and now ur gone. Ill never forget u and one day i pray to see u again but under better circumstances. I love u.

-5	negative	health Confessions	I sometimes find myself thinking bad, generalising thoughts about a particular race. A lot of the time I don't think these things, and I have a few friends who are this race and get along with them just fine without thinking anything of it. But then there's one friend in particular who ocassionally says something that annoys me and I end up having a derogatory thought about their race. I definitely don't like this about myself. friends Confessions

-7	negative	health Confessions	I spent the last three years in almost complete solitude. Spent birthdays and holidays away from friends and family, thinking I was too defected orinsufficient to be near anybody. I went on drunken rages, digging myself in deeper every single time. I recently met a girl and have no idea how to react. She likes me and says I'm an amazing person and that she thinks about me all the time. Someone has told me this story before. I'm not sure I can do this again.

I would rather do this than any act done to me. I'm not talking a brief taste or snack, I'm talking at least 45 minutes and longer if I am allowed. Is this even a fetish? It must be. OK now that that is off my chest, I am also scared of the Hamburgerler, though I have only seen him in McDonalds Commercials I can no longer pretend that he doesn't frighten me.

I wish i would have never let him go, I wish I didn't get so scared and i wish I didn't break up with him Oh god it hurts so bad without him. And actual physical pain in my chest and stomach. I can't stand this. I haven't seen him since halloween of last year. But it hurts just as much and possibly more. I miss him so much I just wish he would come back. I'll forgive him for everything. And i'll love him forever. I'll never let him go, ever again.

-8	negative	health Confessions	I suppose that the male hoebags feel bad about what they have done, just as I do. I hurt someone, I lost the love of my life. I really screwed myself over. Thus we end up on a confession site. Confession is afterall good for the soul. So I confess and I go my separate way. Hopefully I go into a new world, free from hoes and I am a better man for it. Yes I lost the love of my life and the worst thing about it is that I realize I did it to myself. friends Confessions
-8	negative	health Confessions	I sure hope no one I know is on here. I couldn't find that kind of venom in me when I neededit to survive. I have been hurt, but I guess I am one of the lucky ones who does know what a stable life looks like. I don't blame or judge those spilling the poison. Someone else put it inttheir heartsto begin with. It's pain unleashed. Just wish they could find better ways to express and heal. Filling another life with poison is never the answer. Go ahead - flame me - I am done for the night anyway.
-19	negative	health Confessions	I suspected my husband wasn't in   with me anymore. Although, I knew it wouldn't end well. I did it anyway. I made a fake facebook of a woman who liked all the same things as my husband and said that facebook had suggested him to me. I talked to him, I flirted with him. He flirted back. Finally I told him I had a thing for him, and tried to convince him to meet with me. Even if the person didn't exist, I still wanted to see if he would show. He went but I sent him a message at the last minute saying I had something come up. I was really sad that he went. He finally confessed to me that no matter how him and his wife were doing, he would never leave his wife because of his son. I was relieved but still really sad. It was enlightening
-1	negative	health Confessions	it all sounds like lies to me. friends Confessions
-6	negative	health Confessions	 it always takes my breath away. Each touch creates a certain magic bringing sunshine to my cloudy days. My life never had no meaning. I didn't know what forever's for, but now the word has assumed a new meaning. I know I'd still be lost without you, but there's something special about you, baby and I don't want it any other way. Baby, come lay down beside me, let's touch and feel each other through the night, get lost in a world of tenderness until dawn.
-4	negative	health Confessions	it can't be helped. I believe it's not in my fate to have a partner. Somethings are not meant to be. Somethings will juz never happen. One cannot get everything one wants. I give up.Therefore, no more false expectations. I am not going to try anymore. I will take my single status to the grave. I am not going to prepare to fall in love. There u go fellow men, one less competitor to deal with.I shall focus on other things in life. 
-3	negative	health Confessions	It doesn't matter if I'm right or wrong. I'm still the one who always loses in the end. Every single time.
-13	negative	health Confessions	I teach Geometry. The high school I teach at is in a poor area and all the students lack basic skills. The behavior problems are through the roof. I'm told my classes are the best by the administration. Most of my students love me but it is a living hell trying to teach them to state standards. They talk and don't pay attention. This year the state is going to give me a grade based on the students' test scores. I'm stressed. I was getting students to construct a perpendicular bisector and asked two students what is half of 5. One said "1.5" and the other said ".5". I work so hard. I can't believe I am going to lose my job.
-1	negative	health Confessions	i tell my self i am ugly everyday. i am a ** when i go to school. and i hide what i feel behind a smile.
-3	negative	health Confessions	It gives me more of a rush than any other sharp. It's no longer about the blood, but the way my skin is putty.
-11	negative	health Confessions	it had to resort to this. so sad making an imaginary buddy. so sad being involved with someone playing so many "roles" (not you but I'll let you take comfort in the illusion u that you're speaking to many). deep down you're the strong man I saw years ago, sensitive in the best way. so cool and hilarious everyone , including some of your friends said that. no not perfect in any way but really damn good. those that knew you since grade 3, vouched for what a great guy you were. No longer. He's gone. good thing you have that beautiful face going for you and that's about it sweetheart. You f*cked with my whole being and continue to whitewash the stains of deceit. I loved you. No more.
-15	negative	health Confessions	It happened ten years ago. I was 13. My boyfriend at the time had just broken up with me via instant  messenger. My sister took the opportunity to yell at me for some slight I probably didn't do. I ran to the only place I knew to get away. the river bed. there were four guys there riding bikes. I was there with a bottle because I wanted to cut myself and I was going to break it and use the glass. the boys ask me if I wanted a drink. I did. I don't  know  how I could have been so stupid. I ended up in their car and well, we never got any alcohol. they took turns two at a time. one in my mouth, the other inside me. I didn't fight, I didn't want them to hurt me more, I just complied. I remember floating outside myself, drifting  to watch it all happen from above. I watched myself get rapped and  I did nothing  to stop it.
-9	negative	health Confessions	It has been 17 years and I've never completely gotten over you. I've been married, divorced, had children and stayed very busy over the years but somehow you still creep into my dreams; always it seems right before I wake up in the morning.I don't know why I still carry this torch for you, after-all, you and my best friend went behind my back and it was sooo many years ago. I still can't believe you two married and still are. I almost feel like a prisoner to what we had or like I'm being punished for some wrong doing I had done somewhere along the line because seeing you in my dreams; in real life, real time situations kills me. I want so badly to release you from my heart. I've not had an issue doing this with anyone else over the years, not even my ex husband. Why I feel so connected to you, I just don't know.
-4	negative	health Confessions	It has been so long I can hardly remember your face but I remember your eyes. Time does heal everything, I don't feel pain when I think about you anymore.
-1	negative	health Confessions	It has gone like so for weeks on here .. Most of these love & hate shets are all frolm one person.. Destined for 1 person .. That is called manipulation. Unfortunately you will be stuck with her as long as i keep posting things like now .. If i shut myself it should stop after a couple of days  Good luck .. Hope that hurl or someone lie her can make me smilefor a While !  Hi Hurl my sweet friend 8-)
-5	negative	health Confessions	I   the fact that you two put your fat heads together and tried to analyze me. Got you nowhere didn't it? Big mistake, because you two only wasted your times making fools out of yourselves to one another. At least when I make a fool out of myself it's for a "bigger" purpose. rolmao
-1	negative	health Confessions	i think about cheating on my boyfriend just to have sex
-9	negative	health Confessions	I think about you everyday. Wonder how you're doing yeah? I miss you. I wish we could have got it together. There will not be a day that goes by that i will not have some thought of you. You are my friend no matter what. I am sorry I distanced you. But the way we were going it seems better for the both of us if that is the way it will be. In dreams is where we will be.
-6	negative	health Confessions	i think billie piper is weirdly attractive. wen u watch her she can look really nice some times. i'd even go as far as saying "I Would!" but dont think many other people think so
-13	negative	health Confessions	I think I did something to turn the guy I have been seeing away, but I do not know what. I think things were going well. We hung out when we could, we started spending nights together, having a physical relationship, we talk on the phone, he calls me when he is drunk, he has told me somethings about him he doesn't share with many people, and we decided to go on a over night trip to his families beach house. BUT the trip back from the beach house something was different. Now he seems like he is just tolerating my txts, responding with short messages. Am I over reacting, I don't want to lose him. I hope I have not been too clingy.
-4	negative	health Confessions	I think id rather be a lesser personand look like me. then be as hot as you and use it as an excuse to be a bad person. All you ever where was a * talker..and bossy. sorry i dont bed ppl to get what i want. then turn around and say its a rumor.
-8	negative	health Confessions	I think I know who you are  You are a girl,long blonde hair,short  You are in love with another girl .She is black, fat and ugly  Am I right?
-9	negative	health Confessions	i think im going mentally insane. its hard to get me visibly upset but there are a couple things that just push me over the edge until i'm practically crying. one of them is when people sit down and eat any small round fruits. particuallarly grapes. i just can't handle it when people do that. like today my dad was sitting down and eating blueberries and he KNOWS how freaked out it makes me but he had learned about exposure therapy or whatever so he just sat there eating them. i was screaming at him but he kept eating them. it just makes me so mad!!
-2	negative	health Confessions	i think i might have to turn my heart away and just look with my eyes.
-7	negative	health Confessions	I think I m   with someone I barely know!!It s crazy.but I can t seem to help it.I miss them when I don t talk to them.They are all I can think about half the time.I feel comfortable around them, and unsettled without them!It is the wierdest thing..how could fall in love with someone so quickly..without getting to know them.without taking time to get to know themthese are damn powerful feelings.I have no idea if they are real or not.but I am a little tired of fighting them!!
-9	negative	health Confessions	I think I should share this. Advice is always appreciated. For a long time, I've kept all kinds of primal urges of desire and love under strict control. I generally am fun-loving and sponteneous, but desires like that I keep and always have kept secret. Am I wrong for simply fantasizing and not acting on my wants. As some of you know, there is someone I like a great deal but cannot have.  I need a little direction here? Are my desires wrong? I have stuffed as much learning about why I have them as I can into my head, but it still doesn't answer whether I'm wrong or not. I'm usually very lonely when those thoughts enter my head, and I just want some outside opinions. Thanks for listening.
-1	negative	health Confessions	I think its time for Kinrad to get things going in his life!!!! Knuclezz TOO!!!!!! friends Confessions
-3	negative	health Confessions	I think it's time we go the distance, and do something that scares us. If you love someone let them know, if you have fallen out of love let em know It's over. If you like someone let em know, if you can't stand someone let em know. Let's all right now drop everything and reach out and touch someone, and see how it goes. This is our risk for tonight. Let's do this people 
-8	negative	health Confessions	I think I was a little hard on my horse today. I know he was hungry and was afraid he'd miss dinner, but I wanted to ride and ran him up and down the mountain (I mean a MOUNTAIN, not a hill) until he practically gave out. Sounds like animal cruelty, yes, but that's how we calm them down--tire them out. I was selfish and stupid, I admit. friends Confessions

-14	negative	health Confessions	I think my mind ran away with me and now its ruined my life and made me realise in one go just what I might have lost. I may never talk, kiss or hug him again if what I fear has happened has happened. It was a moment of not thinking trying to solve one problem has probably given me a bigger one. But what it has done is made me realise just how important something is to me and how I don't want it to go at least at the moment life without would be terrible. Its the thought that keeps me going on bad days. Stops me worrying on days when I would normally worry a lot and has genrally made me more happy and to think it might be gone is just horrible terrible and very sad. I hope I am wrong but I fear I am not.

-5	negative	health Confessions	I think people who chew gum are disgusting.  There is almost nothing grosser than having to see someone chew gum.  I'd rather be locked in an elevator with 4 obese people who haven't bathed in a month than spend 5 minutes with someone chewing gum.
-6	negative	health Confessions	I think something is wrong with me I keep going back to a person that continously hurts me over and over I keep thinking this is it this is the time he's gonna get it right and all that ever happens is me getting heartbroken. Why do I keep allowing this. I need strength to break away from this man.
-3	negative	health Confessions	I think that every person who doesn't support the Troops should be sent to the front line and used as shields.  People who make the argument that they "Didn't ask for them to fight for me" are ignorant cowards, and I'd love for them to live anywhere but America and try to express their opinions. People who are against the war, that's fine, and I don't agree with the war entirely, either. But don't standin opposition of the troops. friends Confessions
-3	negative	health Confessions	I think that "hug me" Elmo is for the kids whose parents have better things to do with their arms like chain smoke an update their facebook statuses. Anyway, I want one. :/

-13	negative	health Confessions	I thought he would treat me nice as he is my late hubby's best friend.but guess what? he is a total !!!!!Selfish, arrogant,uncaring, self centred, vain.worse than that he spends all his free time on fb chatting up strange women.This is someone who couldnt even bother saying good morning in his text message when he woke me up first thing in the morning with "wake up" and he was in his bed feeling horny, but he can put up a lot of * on facebook (24/ about love and want to see the response he gets from other people. He calls strangers honey, while am the women he supposed to be in a relationship with, gets called my by first name all the time,no honey,no babynope no endearments for me.I deleted him as my friend on skype and facebook.I would rather just rejoice in my late hubby's love and be single for the rest of my life
-5	negative	health Confessions	i thought it was me that couldn't let go but it turned out to be you. i have a boyfriend now and im still your friend but you want to be friends with benifits..i cant do that. it would be tooooo wrong and you said he dosent have to know. why are you thinking like this.
-5	negative	health Confessions	I thought I was going into my first healthy relationship. If I had known who he was I would never have gotten involved.He'll kill himself if we break up. I know because I've tried.I see only one way out now, and I need out.I'm going to kill myself.I need for someone to know. friends Confessions
-11	negative	health Confessions	I thought that nearly 2 years would be enough time for it to all go away and we could move on and mend the damage we two created. Now out of the blue you've done it again and I am having the worst pain in my chest because I know what I have to do. It hurts so bad but I have to ignore you. We cannot do this again. I've worked too hard to try to be a better person and I've come to far to go back now. Why now? I know you have been through a lot too, so why would you risk it all over again?
-1	negative	health Confessions	I threw away all my chances for a happy life.
-16	negative	health Confessions	It hurts if you've always believed the best about THEM even though you've heard contrary things. It hurts if they matter and their opinion of you matter.It really hurts. It hurts if you care for them and value their opinion. It hurts to be abandoned by someone who you wanted and valued in your life. You CANT just stop loving someone if you love them, but if they distance from you because they believe a rumour that really hurts. friends Confessions
-16	negative	health Confessions	It hurts so much. Maybe it is an addiction But, I loved him sooo much. I wanted to be accepted by him, for him to say how much he wanted to be with me and how beautiful i was to him. He gave to me materially, always keeping an emotional distance. Yet, I returned. I thought things would be different, but i was just recycled material, one of many tossed in a can to be used again. Never really good enough for him. But, I love him so much it is sicken. I want to be with him so bad, to consume all of him. I can no longer, my love for him is maddening and leads me to rage simply at the thought of me having to share him with another. I am weakened by love, but refuse to willing be a fool to it.
-4	negative	health Confessions	It is always a pleasure to write   for someone so wonderful and lovely like you. My problem, however, is the difficulty of picking the best words to describe how you have been a blessing and an inspiration to me. I know for a fact that other men feel the same towards you and I cannot blame them. But I just want you to know that of all your many admirers, no one can surpass my sincerity. I would like to confess something. For many weeks, I have been in love. And I am glad that it is with you.
-10	negative	health Confessions	It is important to me that you know that the sorrow I feel for hurting you isgenuine. You're my backbone. You're a blessing. You're a piece of my heart. You're the air I breathe. You're my backbone. I'm sorry for putting you through this. You're the most amazing woman I know. I love you still and always.
-5	negative	health Confessions	It is me baiting. I see that,. You just please the hell out of yourself. Oh I'm so funny. I bet we are covering chapter 6 and 7 .how to kill someone with flip switching by sending out love in excess to no one but implying I am not anyone. Have I just aside at the last moment and it went off target.
-6	negative	health Confessions	it is not in ones imagination. They live with it day in - day out! I keep myself very busy because it helps me to not focus on the 'problem'. Those experts who talk, need to honestlyexercise compassion before they make accusations of 'PERCEIVEDIMAGINATION'! If they had to live with a debilitating health issue, I honestly believethat they would think twice before they say damaging things that are not true. 
-2	negative	health Confessions	it is really not very hard. If its one thing I THOUGHT i was it was your friend.. even if its not the best.
-3	negative	health Confessions	It just occurred to me that I've never really been rejected before. I guess it's high time for me to go through this.
-1	negative	health Confessions	It kills me that he doesn't notice me no matter how hard I try. I feel like a dog but I can't give up yet. I will do anything - Please God, make him care!
-7	negative	health Confessions	It made me someone who I'm not, but I did it because you wanted me to. And you rebuffed me.  No two ways about it.  Slapped me down. So, I wanna know what was the point?  I feel humiliated, hurt, crushed, and stupid.  My face burns.  I would never want to make a person feel like this.  I can only wonder if I did something to deserve this in your eyes. You just threw this relationship to the ground and kicked it I feel so stupid for thinking you cared. I put this confession in the 'love' category your term, not mine.  I am stupid for believing it. friends Confessions
-2	negative	health Confessions	I told everyone my   died to get a promotion

-8	negative	health Confessions	i told my boyfriend that i didn't want him to go online anymore and he hasn't.. me on the other hand have kept going online and keep chatting with ppl i love him but i like to be able to chat with other ppl. i feel bad cuz we argued about it and almost broke up because of it. but i prohibited something i'm still doing i know im a bad girlfriend for doing it. and for that i'm sorry

-4	negative	health Confessions	It really hurt me when he said every since he was 16 he done lived with four or five women before mehow am I any different?! I'm not! He just no good looking for women to live off of. He keep saying he gone get his stuff together but I have come to realize if you are 22 and been doing this since you are 16 then your really not trying that hard! You probably said to those other women you were gone get your stuff together while they tried to be a good girlfriend and let you stay with them until you get back on your feet and it turns out you end up staying way longer than was intended! Smh

-15	negative	health Confessions	I tried not to, I really did. And I thought I was doing good, up until about 8 pm, when everyone all of a sudden started yelling at each other. I don't even remember it happening, but I cut myself againif you can call it a cut. It's more like I got my slicing razor and stabbed it about an inch and a half into my leg. If I didn't know emergency first aid, I'd be in the hospital right now. I'm wondering how long it'll be before someone notices. I can tell I'm walking weak, and I'll be wearing pants to bed so my girlfriend doesn't feel it or anything. *. So disappointed in myself. :/

-2	negative	health Confessions	I tried to listen to your lies, but instead I slit your throat. friends Confessions
-4	negative	health Confessions	I try to forget you. I really do. But when I look at the new man in my life, all I can see is how he doesn't stack up to you. I look at his lips, and know I will never kiss them the way I kissed your lips. Knowing that I will never feel the same way about anybody the way I felt and still do feel about you.Why was life so cruel to take you away from me????
-1	negative	health Confessions	Its 330am. I broke up with her last Saturday. Why is sleep so hard now that she is gone. She was not the right girl for me so my heart needs to get over the fact and heal so I can go on with life!

-3	negative	health Confessions	It's all a manipulation? Nothing more. Okay. I'll accept what you write as truth.
-4	negative	health Confessions	it's because I'm not pretty enough for you, isn't it.Tears falling down my face. I always told myself I never cared, but the truth is,I'm lonely.It'skilling me.
-3	negative	health Confessions	Its been 16 years, and i've been hiding this sadness for sometime. To all the people i told, and assured that i was okay, I'm sorry i lied. I just didnt want anyone to worry about me. Im sorry.
-6	negative	health Confessions	its been 5ish months for me too and I still don't like being around many people because it;s just so embarrassing, feeling like they're all talking about me, even family.  I lost a job and several (ok, more than several) friends because of my last full-blown manic episode. The things I do remember saying and believing and doing are just horrendously embarrassing so who knows what I've blocked out. Maybe it's for the best that I don't remember because it's not like I can change anything.
-5	negative	health Confessions	its been a few months now since we spoke last i thought that i would never forget you when we split up and you would be stuck in my head 24/7 but slowly over these last few weeks you are fading away you only slip in to my mind every now and again and im glad as you dont deserve that place any more it goes to my new love my better love my decent love, i can see him and i being together for a long time , so keep fading away thats how i like it and for any one who was stuck where i was reading this thinking that youll never forget you do .. you just have to find someone much more worthy of your love because if they arnt with you now they didnt deserve you did the,y think on it that way .
-7	negative	health Confessions	it's been a year since you left me and i miss you more and more everyday, i wish you were still here so i can talk to you but i know i'll see you in heaven one day RIP mother and keep watching over me
-2	negative	health Confessions	It's been five days since I've seen your smiling face and kissed those passionate lips. It's so hard to be apart from you nowI'm trying to be patient but it's so hard, I love you.
-5	negative	health Confessions	Its been nearly two years. It was me who left you. It was the biggest mistake i've ever made, and i have no way of contacting you. I know that if i did, you wouldn't ever want me back anyway. Im with someone else. Have been for ages. But whenever i think of you, i cry. I just wish there was a way to take it all back. Or just see you..
-2	negative	health Confessions	It's been years since we broke up but I can't stop thinking about him even though I am with someone else. I know i miss him all the time though I am pretending like he is dead to me.
-7	negative	health Confessions	Its been years & years of bullshit and you still haven't changed. I'm tired just too tired. I'm such a fool for thinking that you actually loved me, such a damn fool. Even though we're going to the same place in life, you can pretend like you never met me, which won't be a problem for you, cause you already do. I know now it's time to let you go because I can't hurt myselfany morewith this. Don't communicate with me or even look my way. I can't deal so even though we're going to the same place, i'm done with you as a friend, close friend, etc. You hurt me & you want to act like you don't know what i'm talking bout & throw dirt on my name. So it's cool, just know we're done, & i'm way past too through. friends Confessions

-5	negative	health Confessions	It seems like every time I get back to a happy place, something happens and BAM!, I get all depressed again. I try so hard to be happy and positive, but it is so hard. I'm good at putting on a front, but inside I'm drowning and I feel like I'm losing myself all over again. friends Confessions
-2	negative	health Confessions	Its funny how some people say 'I don't like drama' when they are the ones who cause it in the first place.
-3	negative	health Confessions	It's hard to be amazed by anything you see online, when you know any teenager with a computer and a pirated copy of Photoshop can cobble together a fake photograph in minutes. 
-23	negative	health Confessions	Its hard to someone you cant have. I just live in the happiness of our memories. The tears of unrequited love breaks and stabs my heart like a million knifes. Why cant i have you?? Why cant you have me?? Dont they know i love you? More importantly do you know i love you? Its been a year now.. You teach me many things, when i see you my heart stops. My faces reddens with surprise. But i know its not right to love you I still believe i can hide my feelings, But im meerly week and frail from head to toe. I hide under my covers at night imagining the thin blankets wereshieldsblocking my feelings from sneaking in while i dream. They always win.. I cry for you.. I look in the mirror and wonder, "Can i be this ugly? Why do i have to love you? Why was i born then." People dont understand how it is They dont know how it is to love someone OF YOUR AUTHORITY. No one will understand; for iam your sun and you are my MOON.
-3	negative	health Confessions	It's horrible. I hate the way people look without hair. I know somebody's gonna jump all over me for being "shallow," but let's be honest -- we all have something that we can't stand when it comes to looks, and that's mine. Guys, at least give Rogaine a try, srsly.
-4	negative	health Confessions	It's January.  We're just coming out of the darkest time of the year. I'm sad. I always get sad and angry during this cold season. I think each year it is getting progressively worse. Driving home today in a rather beautiful light flurry of snow, I was listening to the radio. There was Elton John singing to me.  " hold me closer tiny dancer", he said.  And it hit me like a tsunami.  The emptiness. The lack of feeling. The part of my brain clicking on telling me " you have been on autopilot too long"'. I almost cried. I would have cried but I felt dried up inside.  Elton John makes me cry evaporated tears of desperate longing. I wish this was a story.
-10	negative	health Confessions	It's like you want some kind of groupie standing there staring at you, chanting 'I love you'. You are grown man and the most insecure thing I've ever come across. You are draining the life out of me!!! You have some serious issues but can't or won't admit to anything. No chance of you ever overcoming it. I think that's called a lost cause
-2	negative	health Confessions	It smells funny outside. Like Mother Nature took a poop.
-2	negative	health Confessions	It's nice to be told I'm fun But usually when I'm having fun, I do something I'm usually not okay with in the morning. Making out with guys. Etc.
-4	negative	health Confessions	It's not even the  situation that i am in, I have been positive and feeling good for the most part lately. Depression got me by the 'balls' today and I'm finding it hard to get through. Today I fell back into my sociapathic cycle - messing up, lying to people and then feeling guilty about my bad behaviour, knowing that i can do better .. it's like my report card at school used to say ".she does not use her full potential", when will i ever learn! funny Confessions
-1	negative	health Confessions	its now been 34 days since the blade has touch my arm and drew blood but its been 16 days since i marked my arm with a pin 
-2	negative	health Confessions	It's okay, I still have plenty of grease left on this pickle. I'll work it into your mouth. We'll start with your mouth and end with your @$$. It usually works out that way.
-1	negative	health Confessions	Its over but i still go here and cry like a baby everyday; please belp me
-3	negative	health Confessions	Its really messing me up. I try to be more confident but nothing seems to help and what does help will only help for so long and doesn't really make me feel any better. I rarely see beauty when I look in the mirror. I hate showing my face in public. I reject the guys who ask me out because I never feel good enough. I ended a good friendship because of how I feel about myself. I hate the way I feel about myself
-1	negative	health Confessions	Its safe to say I'm hooked on EP. Ivisit this page at least 5 time per day!!!! I can't wait to see new stories and confessions. I work in an office all by myself and I often feel disconnected from the world.EP helps me feel less lonely. Its a reminder to me that there are millions of people out there just like me who feeland experience life, in spite of their 9-5 jobs
-9	negative	health Confessions	It's Saturday. A day it seems the whole country longs for the most. It's a free day. To do anything you want with the people you love. Well apparently no one loves me. No one calls or texts. No one asks me to jjoin them in some fun activity. Guess it's my own fault. I don't know how to make friends and I can be a drag to be around. It still hurts though. I'm forever looking over to my phone for that little green light indicating someone has an interest in me. I hate spending the day alone. I spend everyday alone. Why would I want to today, the happy free day. I imagine the world laughing and skipping and enjoying themselves. Here I sit in my darkened apartment. Alone. FML. FML. S.h.i.t. Nobody loves me.
-4	negative	health Confessions	It's skin  , it's spread but she's hiding it from me. I havent told any of my friends. I dont want to weigh anyone down. Like my Mum probably doesnt want to weigh me down by telling me it's spread. She's not doing a good job of hiding it though 
-2	negative	health Confessions	It's so cold when I go to sleep, then it's nasty hot by the time I wake up.
-7	negative	health Confessions	its the feeling you get when your out on the town and have been shopping for a couple hours. You tired, hungry, and your feet hurt like a b*tch. But you still have errands to do and you know if you finish them you can finally go home. Except. I always have that feeling. Except home isnt a place, and im not shopping, im living. I dont know how to describe it actually.
-2	negative	health Confessions	It's the same   asked by family N friends over And over again.  And I always tell them I'm not ready.  I only have one son and he's turning 4 this July. The truth I confess is , I don't want another one from my boyfriend.  Because I know that we will never work out and we're already falling apart.  And I don't want to put another child in this situation.  Of daily arguments and fighting.  Day in and day out of little things.  And it's sad to see my son get so hurt watching us fight but yet we still do it anyway.  It's heartbreaking  And this is why I don't want Another kid with this dude!
-8	negative	health Confessions	It sucks to fall for someone who will never feel the same way about you. I wonder if this is payback? For all the times I rejected a guy because I couldn't feel the same way about him as he did about me. But did I ever give him a chance? NoI didn't. When I think back to it, I'm a terrible person. I didn't realize how much it hurt to want to be with someone so much, yet to never be able to express your feelings for them. I thought they were messing around. How can they like me when they only grazed my personality? But now I know. This ache, these deadening, decaying emotions,it sucks.
-2	negative	health Confessions	It's youand i'm not surprised you took them away, afterall you kept yourself away!
-5	negative	health Confessions	IT'sa long story, 25 years long. IT started a continent away and IT continues a continent away. IT's taken place in two languages with misunderstandings and miscommunications. Let me finally break free from the oppression of being away, being alone, being not good enough. I'm too old now for all of this and I've never gotten what I needed from IT. Too many people have been contaminated by IT; marriages, children, divorces, lies, hope, dreams, goodbyes. IT won't go away and IT keeps calling me back, 8000 km, 10 hours of flight, thousands of dollars spent, no answer in sight. I have ignored IT, accepted IT, fought IT, played with IT, hated IT and loved IT.
-3	negative	health Confessions	I turn 17 in a few months from now and I still haven't had my first kiss.. nor boyfriend! It's not like I'm ugly or mean.
-9	negative	health Confessions	it wasn't you replying the other night after all. Yeah, whodathunk that sh*t, right?It was probably just another h orny chickand a rather large chick at that considering that she wanted to cradle me in her big arms and tell me that she loved me. Here I am, pouring my heart out, trying to write something beautiful and poignant,and some fattie in Minnesota is squirming in her size 58panties over it thinking that I'm her man. Story of my life! Why can't it be you, mister? Just lie to me or something. EP, Ihate you!
-4	negative	health Confessions	It was the wrong star I was wishing on. It wasn't a star, but an airplane. Might as well wish, on a passing train for all the good it'd do. If wishes did come true, I'd be there with you, not just wishing on a star. You'd be here with me and not so far away.
-16	negative	health Confessions	I understand that you are a kind and loving soul that only wants to share what you think is best for everyone. But what is best for you is not right for everyone else. To write a letter to family members and plead with them to come to Jesus is just wrong. It makes people defensive. Everyone has their own views and their own beliefs. Stop trying to get others on your team. You have to let it go. You are alienating some of the kindest and most generous members of our extended family. They may not believe what you do and that's okay. It is. You're a sweet lady and loved by many. Just please stop. Stop bothering me about that too. I'm tired of defending myself and telling you about the last time I was in church. When I'm in church I think, "be sure and tell B that you went" and I don't want to do that. You're playing the old lady card, but it's wearing thin. Hugs.
-7	negative	health Confessions	I understand what you are completely saying. No, it does not give the right for anyone to be unfaithful with their vows, whilst they are married. Love is love and there is nothing no one can do or say to stop it. I have accepted the sacred connection for what it is, have walked away,but ithas beenthe hardest thing I have ever had to do.
-2	negative	health Confessions	I used a man I met online for money.

-11	negative	health Confessions	i used to cut like almost every day but i stopped for about 6 months or more because i love my friends hmm and then something happens and i get hurt and stay numb till i cant take it any longer so i cut again .. why do i give up so easy? this year has been the worst year out i started starving again.. in like 15 days all i had was like i dont know 4 pieces of toast or less, cup of soup and a tiny bit of chicken  and if i would eat i would throw it up its like its meant to be a new year full of new starts  i guess this year is just going to old habits 
-19	negative	health Confessions	i used to think family were supposed to be the closet people to u, be happy for u no matter what, do anything to make u smile. COMPLETE *! ive never been so filled with rage as i am in my oun house, my family is completely against anything that makes me happy, nd a am a A,B student, never did or will do drugs, argue, talk back, i aways clean before they are home, nd give up my hw nd skool to follow them where they want. i never have done anything for myself, always for them nd they dont give a *, as for caring about me, they couldnt give a * if i was dead they r focused on my brother, he gets everything nd he is spoiled nd always right, i fukin love it, im the forgoten child who gets wats left of everything. thanks to my family, im considering leaving u.my family has created such incredible, unimaginable hate in me. no one has ever been there for me. god i hate i have to wait another year to move out, once i am gone, i have no plans of looking back at them.
-2	negative	health Confessions	i use to date a lady who unfortunately for lost her to a certain guy
-11	negative	health Confessions	I've always liked him, always been attracted to him. Even when we weren't together, I missed him all the time. I got him back, and we're better than ever! I always think about him, and I cherish every minute we spend together. He was my first kiss, my first relationship, first real boyfriend, and now, my first love. Who knew I'd ever have a chance with him? Not that I'm not worthy, but just not his particular type. But now I've got stars in my eyes, fire in my soul, and a passion I've never known. I don't want to think about being without him again. We've got so much more to do, so much more to experience together. So right now, I'll live this dream.
-19	negative	health Confessions	I've always lived in a lonely world, with only me, myself and I.Ever since I was 3, I've feel abandoned, scared, fearful of everyone in this world.I was never able to be the person I am, until now, but even so,I am NOT happy.My friends are not who I want to be with anymore.There was a time when everything was perfect and it was great, but that was all in the past and now everything has changed.I'm not saying this is ME, but I'm still learning a lot about me.I do know, I am a great person on the inside, but can come out differently on the outside.I just want you to know, this is NOT the LIFE i want to have.I've been suffering through depression and the feeling of jealousy throughout my ENTIRE Life.There were times when I was happy, but.compare to the times when I was sad its just not enough to balance everything outI just want to be happy, Is that too much to ask for god?!Now here I am, moaning and crying about my life,The life that I never wanted; A life that caused me many problems.
-2	negative	health Confessions	I've been dating the same girl off and on for five years.. I should've waited a while and gone after her little sister.
-8	negative	health Confessions	I've been in a deep   for a long time. I've never felt that bad. But my depression is getting worse and I am bit by bit letting t all go. I can't help it. I dont like feeling this way but it every day more bad news or something bad, real bad happens. I realized today that my kids are worried about me. I know how sweet that is They are grownbut no matter what they say, I can't find anything to make this downward spiral stop. I've never see myself like this and I see no ends in sight. No good end in sight.
-5	negative	health Confessions	I've been looking for a job for quite sometime now but I've had no luck. It's frustrating especially with my school loans coming up. I was close to getting a job at a gas station but after a month of not getting my drug test results and then an incident which cause the manager who was hiring to be suspended it ended being a bit of a hassle. 
-25	negative	health Confessions	I've been married for 15 years and have three beautiful children. Three years ago I had to work away from home and I cheated my wife with this lady whom I thought was just a one off. I really loved my wife then and never thought of leaving her. I gradually fell for this woman. I then considered leaving my wife, but then I discovered this woman was cheating on me and after a massive row we parted.  She tells me she cheated because she sees no future in our relationship. I have tried to shut her out of my life and work on getting to love my wife again. But I can't. She calls me everyday and we talk a lot. She tells me she stills loves me and I, of course still love her. Both of us want to move on and forget about this relationship but we are not moving on. I think about her everyday of my waking life. It kills me just to think she is doing to another man what she used to do to me.

-3	negative	health Confessions	I've been seeing this guy for 7 mo. now, I love being with him the way he makes me feel his patience but  he's forcing church down my throat
-6	negative	health Confessions	I've been sitting here all day questioning myself. I don't think I'm going to be able to continue the way I'm living anymore. I cry every day. Whether I have a reason to or not. I'm overwhelmed. Each thing individually in my life makes me happy; together, it's a nightmare. I'm always looking forward to sleep. Sleep let's me escape. It pushes the past away, putting me one step closer to my prayed for break. I just have to hang on until that day comes. If it does. I don't even want to think anymore. I feel lost. And suffocated in my own thoughts. I'm holding back tears. I'm sick of crying. I'm sick of a lot of things. I need help. Or motivation. I need something :/
-5	negative	health Confessions	I've been so moody lately. I know it's a hormonal thing, because I'm getting horrible cramps and the time is right, but I don't have any control of my feelings. These past few days I've been going between being okay to bursting into tears, to being so anxious and scared that I can barely move. I haven't gotten any of my housework done and I've been falling behind. It's been about 5 days of this and my parents and sisters are starting to get really mad at me for falling so behind. But I just can't get myself out of bed. When I do get out of bed I feel better, but I can never stay out of it for long enough to get anything worthwhile done. I don't feel like myself.

-11	negative	health Confessions	I've been with my man for well over 6 years, but I find myself really attracted to this girl I work with. She gives me signs that shes into me to, but she has a girlfriend. All I want is just to know if I have a chance, but atm, it stays unresolved. Shes everything I want and I fanticize about her all the time.
-10	negative	health Confessions	I've fallen asleep. Now I'm missing you. You must've felt like I've stood you up at that time or that I didn't care as much. But I do. I like, like you. Do you feel the same way?I think you're already bored with me. At times, I just want to stare at you as wellnot talking. I don't think that that would be awkwardbut I know you would. You don't like me as much (if you did like me in the first place). do you?You're not the epitome of handsome. Yes, I'm not either pretty. But things are not based on that right? I love the way you look. The way you smile. How your hair goes crazy. How you move. How you can feel shy and vulnerable. You're the guy but you're not afraid to be how you feel.I am longing for you. I yearn to make you smile each dayMissing you. . .
-3	negative	health Confessions	i've finally realized that my boyfriend of a few years will never marry me. now that i don't feel like i'm working towards something, i'm not that interested. i think i'll wait until our lease expires and move out.
-11	negative	health Confessions	I've got a great job and everything is going well right now but I have to face the fact that I am actually just filth. This all stems from not graduating from college. I had a great upbringing. I went to a private high school in England. I went to a great university and had parents who emphasized education extremely strongly. I was always surrounded by really smart kids. Then I joined the Army and went down a path which led me to my current job which is great but not exactly what I wanted out of my future. I am trying to make it right but I know that with my best plan I will probably not graduate till I am 36 or 37. My only hope right now is to exercise regularly to ensure that maybe when I am 32 and come back from Afghanistan (I am currently 3, I can pass off as twenty something and not look like the oldest entry level Electrical Engineer that anyone has ever seen.
-8	negative	health Confessions	I've got some pretty intense   I guess. Doc says it might be manic depressionbut if that's so I kinda wish my highs were a little higher. About as good as they get is like"okay". Maybe it's not manic depression, and just regular depression with occasional relief. I don't know. :/
-3	negative	health Confessions	I've had a best friend for a few years now, and when we were first becoming friends, I was aware that he liked me, but I liked him as a friend, and he never made a move.Now a few years later, my feelings for him have grown (started about 2011 summer), but now we're starting to grow apart even more.I miss my best friend and I want him back.I just don't know what to do. Reaching out doesn't seem to work. I don't want to be the only one trying
-4	negative	health Confessions	I've had a few boyfriends over the past year and a half, but I've never loved any of them, and I've cheated on them all with one guy. He's cheated on every girlfriend he's had over the past year and a half with me. I wouldn't want it any other way.

-9	negative	health Confessions	I've just recently started attending high school again, I had to take about a year off because my anxiety and depression had become too much to handle. Im 16, female, and I'm about half way through grade ten. Grade ten is a very challenging grade, notacademically but socially. I started school again after spring break, it's been about two months. On my first day I only went to my first two classes because on my way home during lunch I * myself. funny Confessions
-5	negative	health Confessions	I've kissed a lot of guys (and girls), and not a single one of them sober. It just hit me the other day and really got me down. I can't recall how many I've kissed or most of their names (Unless you count self-appointed names like "Afro Guy", "Dreadlock Man" or "That Creepy Dude") or even how I felt when I kissed them, bar about two. (One guy who was my first proper kiss, and one who I was crazy about, but who I never had the nerve to kiss sober.) I was crazy about the latter for over a year, but he would only ever approach me when I was drunk, so he could always have the excuse of saying it was a drunken mistake (although he was always sober, and therefore lying to cover his ) He used me and broke my heart. Now I've just started feeling sick with regret over all my drunken fumblings (even molestations, in a few cases) and kindof like I'm unworthy of love

-7	negative	health Confessions	I've loved you for three years, but I know that I have to let you go now. It is the right thing for you..and when you love somebody you put their needs before your own. I will always love you!!!
-6	negative	health Confessions	I've made mistakes in my life, who hasn't right? There are people I should have been nicer too. People I should have given a chance. People I should have had more patience for. Things I've let slip out of my grasp due to laziness, ignorance, pure adolescent stupidity. I just want to get some of this off my chest. Everyone has regrets, and while I don't feel the entire weight of them always pressing on my shoulders there are times where they overwhelm me. I guess it's why I try to be as nice a person as I can be. I'm not one to repeat mistakes. My old life was one of regret and stupidity and its about damn time I let go of it, let go of it and start living the life I should've started living 3 years ago.
-2	negative	health Confessions	I've never been really close with my mom. I just moved to live with my sister and her husband and my niece. My mom and I were just starting to get close, so I'm starting to regret moving, although I was very depressed at my school. I am so homesick for my mom and I miss her so much. It breaks my heart to know I won't see her fora while.

-14	negative	health Confessions	I've never loved a man who wasn't in my family. Until Peter. We met online and I was insecure about myself so I told him I was really three years older and made up a fake name to be safe. After two years I think I fell in love with him. And he openly admitted he loved me-even before I told him. I couldn't take lying to him anymore so I cut him out of my life. Now three years later I still think about him. I'm so ashamed I lied to him because I've never loved anyone else.
-2	negative	health Confessions	I've posted a few ads on the dating page of a websiteLong story short, I'm currently emailing with 12 guys.. I'm sorry if this is inappropriate, but I have to say it. Seriously. I'm an email **. I really, truly am. But they're all so awesome!!! AAAHHH!! Shame on me.
-2	negative	health Confessions	I've prayed/meditated fervently non-stop for my financial situation to improve. I go to prayer boards and its always the same prayer and has been for like 4 or maybe 5 years now. Yet other things I dwell on or just merely think about happen and come true with no problem. I don't know why. I really don't.
-7	negative	health Confessions	I've recently been put on new pills with a side effect ofapatiteloss. Well, out of all the sideeffectsit's the one I'm getting and I've went from 130 pounds to 105 pounds. My doctor is keeping me on the medication because it works for my problem. (I'm epileptic and it really helps with my seizures.) However, I rarely find foodappetizing I snack throughout the day but it's always junk food orMcDonaldsfries and a sweet tea. Anything more like a full meal makes me sick, I don't throw up but I feel as if I'm going to and I just can't eat knowing I'll feel like that. Any advice on something OTHER then junk food that I could snack on that I could carry with me throughout the day?
-5	negative	health Confessions	I've wasted the last week of my life.  other than work all i have done is sit in my room, surf the web, play video games, watch movies/ television and the nightly jog.  My friends are always off doing something, but i never get invited, and well they actually never attempt to talk to me.  If i initiate conversation with them, they just blow me off.  I'm sick of this damn room, and everything is boring.  Time passes so slowly, and im at the point where im sick of living
-2	negative	health Confessions	I'v  liked my  friend 4 2 years, and I think he likes me 2 but I don't have enough confidence to have him know 4 fear he will be grossed out
-8	negative	health Confessions	I vomited when I saw that. You are disgusting and vile and she, no offense, is unattractive and desperate. You are both psychologically undesirable. You have a personality disorder, which means you are not actually human by standard definitions. Got it? Good. Now go have your sick, twisted fantasies about one of your many others. I hear you have a collection of uglies and disturbed ones at your disposal. So, use one of them.

Somebody I can do the same for.I like somebody. Two somebodies. But who truly? Because I don't want to open my heart to the wrong guy. Is it A or B I need?

-1	negative	health Confessions	I want him. Right now. In the schools staircase. AGH funny Confessions
-13	negative	health Confessions	I want my nephew back. I raised him for two years when my sister was being an incompetent, selfish, immature b*tch! I deserve to raise him. He's just a baby, just a little boy, and she hates him! She is so busy with her "new" family that she just ignores him.  I love him so much and it kills me to see this happen. I'm only 16but I could do a better job. I did a better job when I was 12. He called me mom because I was the only mothering he know. She was always too wrapped in herself to care about anyone else.  He was the only thing that drew me out of my depression. The pills. The doctors. Nothing else helped. He was the only thing worth getting up in the morning for. He was the only thing that gave the world color again. I can't stand to watch him hurt.  I wish he was my son. So I could hold him everyday. So I could tell him I love him every second of the day.  So the color would come back into my world.

-7	negative	health Confessions	i want to be able to freely control the day i die. when things get bad enough, if they ever do; i want to be able to pull my own plug. things may turn out that way soon, but im afraid i may owe something to my parents. they've spent blood and money to keep my alive. i feel ive become an independent strong thinker, but im not driven by anything. i think it might be okay since even if they were to suffer, their suffering would only last a single lifetime, no significant long term damage would occur. im selfish, i dont feel very human.

-15	negative	health Confessions	I want to run away every time I see one of them because I can't trust them. They apologized, but they never talked to me about it. I want to tell them how much they hurt me. I want to tell them every excruciating detail of what I went through. I want them to know there is a direct line from what they did to what happened to me. I want to believe they actually care, but I don't think they do. I know they don't want to understand. They just want to decide what happened, and most of all, they want to feel like they did nothing wrong. It wasn't a misunderstanding. They lied and played games. I feel stupid for not feeling like I can go without saying goodbye. I want some closure, or I want to be able to believe they cared. I feel stupid for wanting it so much.

-15	negative	health Confessions	I was 23 and am now 34, it has been eleven years and I still think about it everyday. I had an abortion when I was six weeks pregnant due to an ultimatum. I am a mother of one and she was 2 at the time and was living with my parents and was told that if I had another baby my daughter and I would have no place to live and they would fight for custody of my daughter. It was the hardest decision I had to make since it was actually my daughters father that got me pregnant again and he and I were not together. It was a horrible experience to go through and I tell anyone who considers it to not take the decision lightly.

Im trying so hard, but I cant, I cant. Oh baby, save me. I tried so hard to distance myself,  yet  I fell in deeper and deeper. It was like an attachment. Something I didnt want. Something you didnt want How I knew, oh I knew, but I still fell. How come you didnt feel the same way? Was it me? Was it you? Was it the time?

It's only my heart that cries now and when it cries I can't wipe those tears away or even hide them.
-3	negative	health Confessions	I wasn't sure if he would stay with me long term, but I knew he was a good guy. So, I lied to him, and told him I was infertile. We ended up getting pregnant. It was a trap, and he fell for it. We're married now. But I'll never know if he really loved me, or married me for the baby.*

-3	negative	health Confessions	I was raped and the police walked away from me because I could barely speak after being attacked for 4 hours. I hate myself so much. Maybe if I was dead, the police and my family would DO something in my name for what happened or maybe my life would have been worth taking that night to save others' from being hurt like I was. I hate myself because I cannot seem to move on and I FEEL like no one cares - the police walk away from victims', my family - probably blames me, and well. I guess I KNOW they both do care, but I am giving up, I do not - for the time being, I hate me
-1	negative	health Confessions	I was raped n no one knows
-11	negative	health Confessions	I was seeing a guy I liked so much and we hooked up and I ended up pregnant right away and his ex was already pregnant and he pressured me into getting an abortion and ever since then I have literally hated myself. I hate looking at myself and I constantly want to hurt myself. I have no one to help me out with any of this and I have no Idea how to fix my life. And now he doesn't give a crap about me anymore and he and my best friend are hooking up and know I like him and it hurts me even more to know that. I just wish my life wasn't like this.
-1	negative	health Confessions	I was single and not married   I could be happy with the man I love.
-10	negative	health Confessions	I was working the swing shift one day and needed to take a huge dump. I was self cautious about using the bathroom by the office so I walked over to an office that was under construction and knew there was a bathroom there and no one around. So I go there, take a huge dump, it was very impressive. Then realize the damn toilet had been disconnected since the area was under construction!!! So quickly I grabbed some rubber gloves and an empty box. I took my load and shoved it in the box and walked to the dumpster to toss it. Man that was wild, but as far as I know no one ever found out
-3	negative	health Confessions	I watch, as sad events repeat themselves. I   my family, my friends, but there those times when I am unable to fullfill any of their expectations. I fail to do what is right, no matter how much I try. I can only regret. What more that makes my heart sink in despair, is a beast within me. From my lonely childhood, with nothing but betrayal, a monster full of hate was born. It keeps lashing out at my friends, and breaking their hearts.Do I deserve anything, for being this way? friends Confessions

-8	negative	health Confessions	I went and gave flowers to a retirement home! I got my income tax return yesterday and went and bought 5 dozen roses to give to each of the five floors of a retirement home in this city. It felt good to see some of the older ladies smile and one of the nurses gave me a hug. This is what I call a good day!
-13	negative	health Confessions	I went out last night with some friends and somebody that I really admire told me that I needed to lose a few pounds. I had a few drinks in me and I got really emotional about it. My looks have been so important to me in my life, and I am turning 39 in October. It was a man that said it, and I am not used to men telling me that. I am not fat or anything and I am pretty happy with myself. I am trying not to let this affect me, but it does. I do need to lose a few pounds, but I have been working on it. I ride my bike, go swimming as often as possible, do workout tapes. I am naturally curvy and I like to cook. He has known me for 15 years or so, but I was young and quite thin then, I will never be that way again. It just hurt my feelings, but I guess the truth hurts sometimes.
-1	negative	health Confessions	I went to Game Stop with my   and this guy there told him his girlfriend was pretty. But, he's my brother andI'm a boy.
-1	negative	health Confessions	i went to my sisters engagment party and was sat next too a frind of hers and now this morning woke up with headlice
-5	negative	health Confessions	I went to work today and there you were. Your same loveable self, so real, so alive, so near. You have opinions about everything and you're smart and political but that isn't even it..I honestly can't say what it is about you that I find so wonderful. It's just *you*. This evening I sat next to you and felt so alive by your side and so intensely happy to be there. I wish I could tell you how I feel.
-7	negative	health Confessions	I will continue to believe what I know, until I know otherwise. I just had the most awesome kiss, two days in a row now.  I'm going to savor them.  They were the best kisses I've had in my whole life. friends Confessions
-3	negative	health Confessions	I will do anything to become rich and powerful.  i do not feel ashamed about it, but i do know that it is immoral.  i have no loyalty to anyone, and would step over even those who would help me to get what i want. crime Confessions
-15	negative	health Confessions	I will never say goodbye to you. Grieving for you is a reminder of a blessedlove which I will never let go. You and I become one in the spiritual world and I know that we will meet again very soon. If it is not in physical, I am looking forward toconnecting with you in the spiritual realm.Thank-you my beloved for the memories. When I let go of you I am letting go of dreams and it does not matter who I talk to they will always tell me to let go of you. Once soulmates bond it is for eternity. No hex, no amount of talking and forgetting something ever happened, is indeed a futile exercise. My lesson in life was to love you and with this love you have given me, it has inspired me to always take risks. You are taken and I will never cross that line because I love you too much and do not want t see anyone get hurt. Be strong and happy for me because when you are sad I feel your pain.

-1	negative	health Confessions	I will succeed. I shall keep telling me that until I believe it.
-7	negative	health Confessions	I wish I could meet my twin soul soon, I have friends and family but I'm so lonely, I don't believe in falling in love. I think when you meet the person who is meant for you, the love is already there, you'll never have to question it becuase you'll see it everytime you look into their eyes.
-11	negative	health Confessions	I wish I didn't feel this way because I realize you'll never feel the same. I don't know why, but I want more from that night I want that night to mean more to you.Knowing you're off to Vegas kind of hurts; I do want you guys to have a good time, I'm just realizing that partying and girls mean more to you than what happened between us. I guess I knew that was the case before/after that night with you. You're kind of a ladies man and I'm kind of an idiot. I suppose I'll get over it one day.
-1	negative	health Confessions	I wish I died when I slit my wrists last year.

-6	negative	health Confessions	i wish i had someone to just talk to for a change, instead of holding everything in. i wish i had someone to tell my secrets too and to bail me out when i get into trouble. someone i can count on. i just wish i had a friend. i pushed everyone away and i just wish i didn't. now i'm left feeling all alone in this world. feeling like things will never change. that it doesn't even matter anymore. like no one cares.
-1	negative	health Confessions	I wish I was rolling on X right now.  Unfortunately, my job does random drug tests.
-9	negative	health Confessions	i wish i was with you right now. Peacefully sleeping in your strong, beautiful arms. I would turn over to face you, caressing your handsome face and kissing you softly to wake you and greet the new day. We would smile tenderly and lovingly at each other, feeling lucky to just be together, to be alive, to be so in love. no guilt, no regrets, you are the greatest love of my life. i never saw this all coming, yet all i can think of is you. so hot, so sweet, our passions ignite until we get lost in each other for the next few delicious hours mmmmmmmm.have a wonderful day, i miss you, my love.
-8	negative	health Confessions	I wish I were thinner and prettier and smarter and less shy and funnier. I wish I could just mold myself into someone you would look at twice. Don't get me wrong, I could never be with you (I'm too beneath you). And I'm happy you're happy and I'm happy you've found someone but I never knew it would hurt this bad. I've never liked anyone before so I imagine this feeling of devastation will go away, but I'm in literal pain. How can I like you so much that seeing you hold hands with some guy causes a physical pain in chest. I just want this pain to go away.P.S. In my 20 years, I have never seen anything as undeniably gorgeous as your eyes.

I'm sitting on the floor in the dark, the christmas tree is lit with all its bright colorful lights, (no ornaments or tinsel yet) it is cold outside and gently snowing.  Everything is covered in white.  Your head would be in my lap and you woud tell me stuff.. Things that you need to let go, things you want me to know.  I would cry with you I would hold you, I would love you and sympathize with you.  You would know that I love you more than anything.  You would feel good and safe and you would feel like home and you would let go of or at least a little of the stuff that troubles you and you would feel better at least for a little while and you would know that we will sit here again and for as many times or forever until you know that you are so very loved regardless of what happened in the past. friends Confessions

-12	negative	health Confessions	I would like to fall freely. I don't want pretense. If I feel like ** I want to freely say it. If I want to laugh at small things I want it to matter and I want you to laugh with me. If I feel like crying I want you to hear my heart and hold me up. If I am having trouble getting off the ground would you get off your arrogant  and walk with me. I won't be here for long..I hopeand I will eventualy be free to love again.

I cannot explain the thoughts in my head to anyone. Nobody understands what I see and how I feel. I have friends and family, but they do not truly know me. I know me. From the day we are brought into this world we are on our own. Nobody has your back one hundred percent like you do. Stand up for what you believe. Follow your own truth.

-12	negative	health Confessions	Just Bieber has done nothing wrong, I honestly think he's kinda adorable (not my type, but honestly a cute kid, especially with his shorter hair.He has gotten so much * throughout his career and he has done so many good things such as It Gets Better Project and other good things.It's like these 20-30 something old dudes hating on him. That's really pathetic. Especially the people on 4chan who say * about them, they are definitely going far in life. Even if people don't care for his music it's no reason to say such awful things about him.I think it's good he's living the way he wants.I actually listen to some of his music some times, it's my favorite but I've definitely heard a lot worse.

I clasped your hand in mine and felt you embrace me warmly. I pressed my lips to yours to taste your sweet kiss. You held me for a minute. In this moment that passed fleetingly I woke from the dream with a thought of you that stayed with me throughout the day and it never once faded.

I asked for water, a few minutes later she offered another water for me, right when I moved my glass, the damn thing broke I couldn't believe it. I simply said "please close out my tab please!" I had to get out before I caused anymore trouble. She said its okay, but it wasn't to me.. I left her and extra tip for my troubles. I left frustrated and mad at myself. I went home to go sleep the crappy moment.

I already got into a school that I really didn't care about, and it was the only one that said yes despite my 4.0, perfect attendance, and high involvement. Now I am working even harder at the University that I hate and my motivation is still in the toilet. I work like a horse, but just don't care. Why would I?

-11	negative	health Confessions	Last summer I took a two-week vacation to Atlantic City, New Jersey. One day I went to the beach with my ID in my bathing suit pocket. I swam in the ocean with the ID in my swimsuit pocket -- and you guessed it. I lost my ID in the Atlantic ocean. I'm afraid that the ID card will float out into the ocean and will be found by a dolphin with dolphin mafia connections. Now the dolphin mafia could find out where I live and come after me!! Some day I'll be at home relaxing and some dolphins might show up at the door with assault rifles. Gotta watch out for the dolphin mafia!!
-3	negative	health Confessions	Last week I realized that I have stuff everywhere. Clutter and mess! I decided that I don't want it that way anymore. I cleaned up and decluttered and, except for my desk and bedrooms, I have kept it that way. Amazing. Everything is so much easier. Now I just need to get the desk and bedrooms done.
-13	negative	health Confessions	Lately I've been feeling terrible my left lung just hurts so much and I don't know the heck to do. Sure I'm stressed but who isn't? I'm fine with feeling a little under but now its starting to affect my gut and my everyday life. Still I don't want others in my home to notice my declining health. Some symptoms of course not including the painful left lung and gut is severe change in diet like I eat hardly nothing, I can't' get enough sleep to save my arse, feeling weak, and my head just wont stop fricken pounding its like a giant has stepped on the sucker and decided to home there. I know some of you are thinking 'Don't be on the computer too much!' I don't in fact I'm only on briefly and this is one of those times. I know I should've put this under questions but hell this feels more like a damn confession to me since I have no one else to tell or want to anyways. I'd like for serious answers but if you can't help yourself then go for it.

-1	negative	health Confessions	Let someone   you just the way you are  as flawed as you might be, as unattractive as you sometimes feel, and as unaccomplished as you think you are. To believe that you must hide all the parts of you that are broken, out of fear that someone else is incapable of loving what is less than perfect, is to believe that sunlight is incapable of entering a broken window and illuminating a dark room. friends Confessions

It was really nice.till I got to the eyes. Not my color, but..it's ok.
-2	negative	health Confessions	Lonliness is destroying me. I feel incomplete and can't do anything right. I'm just so unable. I've been without friends for so long. I need help.

-11	negative	health Confessions	Looking back on it, I should have seen how you were playing me like a deck of cards. The "waiting to meet my parents" nope. You never wanted me to meet them, I was just your little plaything. You took away my innocence, and I hate myself every day now for letting you. You bulldozed right over my logic, and entranced me somehow. You deserve an Oscar for your performance as "best disappearing man". You took what you wanted and left me to deal with all the repercussions. I just want to know why.
-12	negative	health Confessions	Looking back when we first met, you did one thing good..But your ways, have made me grown to hate you especially since they told you * and you started reacting to what they said, and so did I, I did everything in my power to not portray anything like that.And you only made everything worse, you condemned me, tearing out a piece of me that wasn't even there.I have grown to hate you since the last day. friends Confessions

-3	negative	health Confessions	Love is an emotion. Emotions are not rational. Go be irrational today with someone who really loves you. True love never fails.
-7	negative	health Confessions	Love is not a mystical force that binds us all. It is a series of chemical reactions that happen when the body is stimulated, creating the feeling of attraction to another. Love is a word to describe this process, it is a concept created by people for explanation. When love is not lustful, like the love between a family or friends it is a natural defence built in to ensure the prosperity of our race. We feel the need to surround ourselves with friends, people who we can associate with and ally against threats from others. This is for security. We may look after the sick and infirm, this sort of love is ensuring we survive through adversity. Love is truly a device, a primal force in our psyche which enables us to thrive. The story book version is sickly and fanciful. Discuss.
-12	negative	health Confessions	Love. I think ever since my   walked out I think I've been saying to my family,well asking: Do you love me?!?! They always say Yes,But it never feels like it. What's wrong with me?!?! I know I'm insecure and have low self esteem,but I think there is something telse. But I don't know what it is. Any Ideas or whatever anyone(NOT A TRICK QUESTION)?!?!

-11	negative	health Confessions	Many days I feel down, but no-one knows. "Smile in the face of adversity" is what I've always told myself. Don't get me wrongultimatly I'm a positive Soul. Smiling, good energy, good to have around. Yet lately, I look at my life, look at what I've achievedand I just feel down. Finances, lack of time and not feeding my creative self are all taking their toll. I think I want someone to take notice. Hide me away for a fw days so I can re-charge. I'm on my a** right now but no-one notices, seems no-one cares. I know I'll carry on (because I always do!). But once, just onceit would be nice for someone to inspire me rather than be the one who does the inspiring. Got no where to run anymorejust me, the keyboard and you I guess  Much loveMe xxx
-15	negative	health Confessions	March 31st, 12:48 AM. That was the day I opened your pack of cigarettes. The events that happened in school that day had made me more depressed than ususal. "They don't know me. They don't know me." I repeated those words to myself, over and over. I could hear my own voice starting to break. Weak and cracking. My eyes started to sting. I reached over to the bed, where I hid your pack of cigarettes. Gold A class 20 pack of Marlboros. My hands ripped at the plastic wrapping, still repeating those same words. Those same heartbreaking words. Once I had opened the pack, the smell of the cigarettes smelled exactly like you. And I loved that smell. It was beautiful. It made me admit the truth to myself. "They don't care." At that moment, tears started to flow. I held a cigarette weakly between my lips, breathing only through it. I cried myself to sleep that night, breathing in the sickly sweet of your cigarttes in the pitch black darkness.
-7	negative	health Confessions	Maybe I shouldn't have posted that post on my blog earlier! Just read my star sign, and it's warned me not to! =S Oh, I wonder what sh*t I'll get tonight then, or maybe even tomorrow! Haha! Truthfully I hope the girl the post is aimed at reads it, she needs to know the truth. She wouldn't listen to my words and take heed thoughshe's too ignorant, selfish, cruel and immature. 
-10	negative	health Confessions	Maybe it's just because I'm not all that present and relaxed today, but I really am stressing about my workload. I have to finish a freelance project in less than 4 weeks and am way more behind schedule than I anticipated (and way underpaid for the work). On top of this, I have two other jobs, one of which my boss keeps asking me to take on extra hours.Of course, it's not just physical things either. I have spiritual orders and adversaries in my life, and sometimes it gets hard to keep hearing "It will all work out in My plan," when you don't know what will happen in said plan.So, I'm left with no time to meditate, loss of sleep because I have to keep working into the night, almost no social time (which is even spiritual important!), and a family that is pushing me to work even hardergah.
-3	negative	health Confessions	May your day be happy and bright. Mine is whenever you are in sight. I'm missing you each day and night.

-9	negative	health Confessions	Me and my friends are going to the   on April 7. They all have bf's and I think I'm the only single one. One of my friends is close to the girl from the other class and she wanted her to come with us. We all agreed but to my surprise she's the new girlfriend of my "ex-boyfriend" and my ex-boyfriend is coming with us.I have no feelings for him anymore but our break up didn't have a closure and it was awful. I'm thinking that the situation will be awkward especially that his new girlfriend doesn't know that we had a past relationship but all the other people there knows all about us.I'm gonna tell the truth I will be feeling out of place and a 'lil bit jealous because I have no one to bring with me. ughhh I wish I didn't dump Ram.
-9	negative	health Confessions	Me and my husband came back from a short stay at his parents to find that one of his gerbils had killed, eaten the legs of and buried his cage mate. The deceased had been bullying the other two, and we thought he was fine to be separated with his brother, but apparently not I liked him, but he kinda had it coming. But now I'm a little creeped out by the surviving gerbil. friends Confessions

-16	negative	health Confessions	Megan (I feel like I'm cheating just by typing your name), I have a longing to be with you and it's tearing me up inside. I don't know why I fell for you but I know you fell for me as well.  I have tried to shake this feeling and let you go, but can't.  Circumstance always brings you back into my life more often than I can handle.  If I was not with someone else, I know I would be with you.  We both stated that it can never be since I am in love with another.  I love her, but at the same time, I have a deep feeling that I should be with you.  She makes me happy in different ways and you make me happy where she doesn't.  But those other qualities she has, I also see and feel from you.  Why has this happened to me?  What should I do, who do I pick?  Is it possible to be in love with more than one person?  How do let go of the person I love or the person I know, deep in my heart, I should love?
-2	negative	health Confessions	Men. Are there actually ANY who arent just after one thing? Who actually DONT make you their option? I have yet to find one.
-6	negative	health Confessions	Men who watch a lot of * seem dead inside.  They want no emotional ties so this is why they get so much pleasure from watching someone they do not know.   They can never get enough, they keep getting weirder and sicker because they are trying to fill a void that will NEVER be filled.  During the actual act with a female they would rather give pleasure because they don't get much pleasure from actually loving THEE particular woman who is real.  Usually they use her for other selfish reasons and only have a gf so people don't catch on to how superficial they are.   The devil smiles with glee every time you watch x x x.    It is coveting another without the feeling of love.    I mean its okay to be curious but I think most men would rather have the real thing.
-3	negative	health Confessions	Merry Christmas! Your cable, phone and home internet have been shut off and you have to take your tv back to rent-a-center! You also can't afford presents for your loved ones! I'm so glad she won't remember her first Christmas, cause this year it kinda sucks.

-10	negative	health Confessions	Mom and I were at the family hall. The TV is on and suddenly a program catches out attention. There's a particular scene where a poor guy left his wallet. He's on a date and he cannot simply tell the girl "Oh, I need to go back home to get my wallet. Stay here and wait for me". LOL. The girl obviously knows what's going on so she offer to pay the bills. The guy said that he would rather wash all the dishes to cover up for their orders. My mom told me. "Like your ex-boyfriend right?" Whew.. I just don't know what to say.

-3	negative	health Confessions	Most my family and friends think that I'm smart and really kind-hearted and talk highly of me to each other. The truth is, I'm an ice addict and have just lost my job due to this terrible addiction.
-15	negative	health Confessions	Most others would say biological  , but to me she is practically nothing. I know how bad that sounds, but trust me you don't know her. How manipulative she can be. How many lies shes told to get what she wants. All the times she cried and wished to be here with us I'm sure that was a lie too. She claims to think of me everyday, but somehow only finds the time to call on holidays. I'll give her props for that if only a little. I shouldn't play the part of victim; I know I could call her. I'm seventeen and sure as well have a cell phone. The way I see it though, is that she should make the effort. She has made many mistakes in her life and I wish she would make up for them, but I never hear from her. I don't even remember the last time she called was it my birthday? She calls me her angel. I'm no angel anymore..

-7	negative	health Confessions	My 13 year old daughter is pregnant.  She will be 14 when the baby is born.  She had barely started her period when she got pregnant.  The father is 20.  His mother was a good friend of mine, until this happened.  I am going to get him arrested for statutory rape as soon as the baby is born when it can be proven through DNA that he is he father.  The baby will be put up for adoption, even though my daughter wants to keep it.  No way.  Her father is in the end stages of brain cancer.  He can't help me.  It's all he can do just to take care of himself.  Am I doing the right thing? friends Confessions

-9	negative	health Confessions	My 21 year old daughter is going to have an abortion.  She and her boyfriend live together and love each other, but at this time in her life she is not ready to have a child.  I agree with her decision, but I am so sad inside.  I want a grandchild so badly.  I told her she will be sad about this for the rest of her life, but I know she has no choice.  She thinks she will get over this, but I know it will stay with her forever.
-5	negative	health Confessions	my abortion has really effected me! and so it should. I regret itentirely and wish i never did it, but im too young to have kids. me and my boyfriend really wanted to keep it but his family where completely against it and i felt under pressure to do it and i couldnt tell my family and still havent and never will. I dont want to ever feel happy again but my friends said to stop being down and it was for the best, i mean i suffer from depression anyway and they didnt think it would be fair to bring it up in my condition at the time . Do i deserve to ever be happy again ? and if so how can i do that ? how can i ever be happy ? please comment with your truthfulviews.

-6	negative	health Confessions	My   always sabotaged me, too, and still causes trouble in our 50's. It's unnecessary jealousy and nothing can help that insecurity. I just call her on it and keep a little distance.  She says we're like connected but I know her imbalanced soul.

-11	negative	health Confessions	My bf proposed to me and i said yes and I'm so freakin excited! you have no idea how much i love him and how amazing he is. I couldn't believe it when he asked i spent 10 mins asking him if it was a joke. He laughed and said he was serious and i said yes and I'm so glad i did.

-2	negative	health Confessions	My boyfriend has secrets And it's driving me insane friends Confessions
-8	negative	health Confessions	My boyfriend hit me last night and split my forehead open.  I should have called the cops on him, but I didn't.   And while I was in the bathroom bleeding he was on the computer trying to hook up with some girl.  Needless to say this relationship is over, but what he did to me will not be.  I took pictures of my wounds and will be sending them to his family so they will know the real reason we are not together anymore instead of some lie he will most likely tell them.
-3	negative	health Confessions	My boyfriend leaned in to kiss me. I turned my head so his lips brushed against my cheeks instead of on my lips.
-13	negative	health Confessions	My boyfriend of 3 and a half years is 17 I'm 16. We both want 3 or 4 kids. I want them between 19 and 25 but he wants them between 28 and 40 he said. But I just found out I'm pregnant and I'm scared out of my mind that he's gonna think tht it's too ironic that we recently talked about baby ages and how I wanted them way before he did and he's gonna think I'm pregnant on purpose and I'm not. I'm so scared. I don't know what to do. I don't know how to tell him that his dreams are ruined and so are mine. I feel like he's gonna tell me to put the baby up for adoption but I want this baby to be mineI love him or her already.I'm so lost
-4	negative	health Confessions	my boyfriends ex girlfriend was one of my friends, and now every time i see her .. i'm not sure if i should dislike her, or not. it's kinda like i'm jealous of her in a way.. and it  me off. i want to be her friend still, but i can't get passed that she slept my boyfriend before i did 
-10	negative	health Confessions	My boyfriend talks about his ex a lot. he never knew her in real life, though cause he met her on the internet. he says that he thinks they were "soulmates". but they broke up because the distance got to be to much. It makes me feel like crap when he talks about her, like he's just settling with me. I feel like I'll never be as perfect as her. but I love him so much.

-10	negative	health Confessions	My   doesn't   me.  I know this, I have my entire life.  I'm an adult now, and she still feels the need to tell me everyday how much of a mistake I was, and how I ruined her life.   I'm okay with it now.  I have other loving caring people in my life, and my father adores me.  It makes me feel bad for herthere is nothing as unconditional as a childs love for their mother, and she will never know what that feels like.  I do love you mumma, but I'm tired of being the only one working on our relationshipso now no matter how badly you may want one in the future, 23 years is too long to make up for.
-5	negative	health Confessions	My dog is sick and we haven't taken her to the vet yet. It's been almost 4 days and I'm not sure if she's had any water (without chucking it up). I made her lick an ice cube and drink some water out of my hands. I really hope my mom takes her to the vet tomorrow.

-10	negative	health Confessions	my ex boyfriend proposed to me two weeks ago, it was a shock, I told him I'd think about it but the next day he just ignored me again. I haven't talked to him properly for at least a week. It hurt that he "forgot" about it but it made me wonder what would have happened if I'd said yes? I'm glad we're not together anymore. He cared about the sex more than me in the end.
-13	negative	health Confessions	My "ex-stepdad" is a loser and a drug addict. He'd spend all of my moms money on pills and she lost her job so she was looking for a new one. She called the local video store to see if they were hiring, and gave them her information. The lady at the store said "Ma'am, we'd love to interview you, but you have $480 worth of late fees from adult videos." My mom hung up right then. Apparently he had rented out the max amount of p0rn0s allowed in her name and never returned them. She said she was p-ed of and felt like they wouldn't hire her cuz she came off as a creep because of him.
-22	negative	health Confessions	My Family's going to be disappointed. I'm losing my grades.. each semester, my grades are getting lower. And this is the first time for me.They always tell me what I should do in the future and what kind of Job I should take after College. I know they're helping me realize what I want but what they're doing to me is not helping me,.. I guess. My mom is always comparing me with my Eldest sister (she's smart, a valedictorian, and is a Law student right now). It pains me when my mom keeps mentioning my sister's name and how proud she is even though I did my best of what she wants me to do. lately, im getting used to it but deep inside, I'm hoping she would ask me, how am I doing in College and some other things.
-3	negative	health Confessions	my feelings for her have become so intense.i want her,i need her, i love her.for her to be mine, in my arms. forever while i hold herplease let it be true what she tells me.i pray to a god i don't believe in to please, please let it be so and most of all her happiness.for L.

But god there is just so much constantly running through my brain. We argue sometimes more than others. And things that happen really drive me crazy and I cant let them go. i know he loves me and would never leave or cheat on me. but i cannot stop thinking that he will, and than we argue.first over something small and than it turns into me letting out all myinsecuritiesand fears about him leaving me.i can tell that he is getting so fed up with it so instead of him trying to console me he just shuts off, and i cannot say i blame him. but it makes me feel worse. i really need to get ahold of my emotions and anxieties before i lose him.

-9	negative	health Confessions	My grandmother is battling Depression and her pills are making her even more sick!! Today she had a mental break down. She was not her self at all to the point where I considered a demonic possession cause of what she was saying. I can't drive right now and because of that I had to get every one else in the family involved. All in all today was a trying and long day. She didn't get any help today. Her doctor is at a medical conference right now, can't come back until next week. We took her to the ER and apparently hearing off the wall voices and seeing crazy things isn't sever enough for them cause they kept pushing her back farther and farther. So she is home, in the same shape she was in this morning, I fear it will get worse before it gets better.
-1	negative	health Confessions	My grandparents asked me to submit an online order for them, since they did not know how to use a computer, and gave me the money for it. I found coupon codes and such, so I had $50 to spare. Unfortunately, I am short on my bills and I feel like keeping the extra. I feel like a horrible loser. Forgive me, Granny. friends Confessions
-9	negative	health Confessions	My Graves disease makes it 100x worse. I woke up drenched in sweat like I had been dunked in water 3 times last night and then had to get up because my calves started to cramp badly. Only upside is my bloating goes away after a few days of night sweats and I don't look so puffy. I don't have flair ups too often but sometimes when I pms the hormonal changes eff me up until shark week whrn everything normalizes. Eff it. I wonder if I have a muscle relaxer around here gonna be moving some heavy furniture tonight that's gonna land me on the couch. Why didn't I marry a Nurse Practitioner or something?
-8	negative	health Confessions	My Great Grandmother died today.It was a shock. She wasn't obviously ill. She'd just had a minor spell in hospital, about four weeks ago, which was the last time I saw her.I didn't see her as often as I should have.I didn't phone her as often as I should have.I wish I could tell her exactly how much she meant to me, how much I valued her pride in me, and how I will always always love her.
-8	negative	health Confessions	My hair is naturally frizzy/ wavy/ curly and I hardly go a day without straightening it. Every time it gets wet (or even just a little windblown sometimes), it frizzes out again, and so I have to straighten it constantly. I am extremely jealous of those born with naturally straight hair. No one ever sees my 'true self' except for my family, because they live with me. Despite the damage that is caused by always flatironing my hair, I will just continue to do it forever Sometimes I even consider hiding away because it looks hideous I mean I can't even go swimming with friends or be out in the rain with people or anything like that because of my hair. I cannot seem to let go of my big insecurity and leave my hair natural

-3	negative	health Confessions	My heart and my   runs so deep for you my dear if you'll only let it be known that you have those same feelings for me, and let your hair down as well as those big, thick, tough walls.

-2	negative	health Confessions	My heart goes out to youtruth is, it will be very difficult to get pass this without telling the person how you feel, I'm speaking from experience. I just avoid him and hope that one day my feelings will go away. It's been a few years and I'm still not there. It would be wrong to do this any other way.
-5	negative	health Confessions	my heart hurts. I don't think thats right, is it? Maybe I should just stop being determined to be able to see you and stop talking to you. I sometimes wonder, what if we never had dated? What if I had held our relationship longer? I'll never know now since you won't even let me try, you said you would try but I have a feeling you aren't trying to see me.
-1	negative	health Confessions	my heart is broken and i need someone to hold me
-6	negative	health Confessions	My heart was closed, a blank canvas, like a virgin.. untouched. Though I loved.no one ever painted their soul on mine. Until youwith the brush of your passions painted my heart with joy reserved for angels. With the hues of love, and with the soft touch of an artist, your loving hands moved the colors of my soul and  blended them with yours. Creating in me sunsets and moonlight, oceans and shores, my eyes get lost in yoursLike a painter lost in her art. You will never know the masterpiece you've created.

-15	negative	health Confessions	My husband after 15 years of   cheated on me with my best friend after I found out about the affair he cut all ties with her even changed job within days of me finding out I was still very hurt and had a very hard time dealing with the affair. I confided in a coworker to have someone to talk to about what was going on. He just seemed to listen and understand and then it happened .. Yes I have been having an affair for 6 years now. I think I did it for the first time within a month of me finding out about his.I did it for revenge. The only difference is I have continued my affair and have no plans of stopping. After all he started it.

-6	negative	health Confessions	My husband got drunk on New Year's Eve. He told a roomful of my closest friends that he was duped into marrying me and that I was a deadbeat. He said that I was in debt $46,000 and never told him - and that he was forced to pay this money back - because I'm not capable of earning an income.What he said wasn't exactly true. I owed $2,000 in back taxes. I was a struggling college student - working full time and supporting myself - and got into financial trouble. Nothing near the $46,000 he was ranting about!I can't stand him. I don't know what to do now.

My secret is that in a couple of months I plan to tell her live in boyfriend about the 2 of them.  I want her to experience the pain that I have and I want to ruin her life.

-8	negative	health Confessions	My   left my mom for another woman and my husband has lied to me about women. I think men who cheat are scum.Sometimes, if I'm bored and have 5 minutes to waist I like to F&CK with married men on craigslist. I happen to be highly tech savvy so it's easy.I search for 'married' or 'attached' men on Craigslist (straight or gay). Then I send them an email with random writings I find online about cheating husbands. And if I'm feeling really feisty I find out their email address then use my easy internet tools to discover their identity, their jobs, etc. Then I tell them I know who they are and watch them squirm.
-6	negative	health Confessions	My life has been hell for 15 years.. I grew up in an abusive home and I quickly learned the tricks to lying about my homelife.. people always asked me why i had this bruise or that or why i was so 'sick' and had to stay home.. in september last year I couldn't take it anymore.. i cut myself. but just once! now it's turned into an addiction spinning out of control.. I'm so confused and anything i ever do anymore is wrong and i can only seem to help other people.. i give people advice, i help random people on the street and in the stores and i guess i seem like a happy person but when i'm alone i curl up and cry then my depression takes over again and i cut myself to get myself going again.. how do i stop this!? i'm so ashamed of my scars and myself
-3	negative	health Confessions	my life is a lie it feels like, i have lied so much and to so many people that i don't think i can even trust myself. i always feel like i'm hiding something. friends Confessions

-9	negative	health Confessions	My manager is a really bad person. He has no people skills, he is rude, self-centered just to name a few. In other words he is a pure devil and he treats people like sh*t. He lies all the time too, hitting on all the girls and nobody said anything . Everyone just hates him. Anyway, we found a real plastic sh"t we wrapped it up, and sent it to him. It was a pleasure watching him being so furious for a change. hahahahahaha
-6	negative	health Confessions	My man of 3 yrs has been caught chatting 2 women online. he says im over reacting and that he was only looking for friendship. we have a baby and recently lost a pregnancy however i have not turned to anyone else during this difficult time. he believes perving is natural but swears this was innocent.
-10	negative	health Confessions	My mom died the last day of my sophomore year in high school. All my friends went to my aunts house to have a get together and I had an urge to stop in and tall to her for a while since I hadn't seen her in several months. Idk why I had this sudden urge but I ignored it and went on to my aunts. 2 days later, on mothers day, I got the news that her neighbor found her dead, and was thought to have been dead for 2 days. So for mothers day that year, I bought my mom a coffin and some flowers for her funeral.
-4	negative	health Confessions	My mom would have the desire to live again. That drive for life and a hearful of joy filled with happiness. God, pleasebreath that new life inside of her. She means a lot to me, even though I find it hard to tell her because I don't know how to share me heart felt feelings.
-3	negative	health Confessions	My mom yells at me when i cry..is there anyway i can get the freedom to cry when i want to?
-9	negative	health Confessions	My mum caught me logging calories onto my phone Sh*t. I hope she doesn't find out about my diet Though she dropped the subject after saying "don't get too obsessed over calories" and I said "don't worry I not." That was all that was said on the matter. But I made sure I had two bowls of tuna pasta for dinner so she didn't suspect anything. And even after having TWO bowls of tuna pasta my total calorie intake was only 911Kcal today Still, even though I managed to stay under 1000Kcal, I wish I hadn't had that bowl of cereal and milk "/ Should have saved those 369Kcal on breakfast, and had a 72Kcal dessert mix with a 108Kcal banana instead 180Kcals instead of 369Kcal Yep, that sounds way better. Wish I'd done that now B*gger.

-17	negative	health Confessions	My nan had a mini stroke the other day and my uncle who looks after her went flying and broke his nose this morning because he has to walk her and take her to the toilet and everything because she cannot move her one leg. My cousin just text me saying she would come with me to my doctors appointment I asked how she was and she said crap lately I asked why and she tolde about nan and her dad and said "I need some luck in my life man" WTFF. Yes it's terrible that she's had to see all this happen and that she's helping with nan but the fact she said luck in her life?! I find that so rude and inconsiderate! It's nan that's hada stroke and her dad that's broke his nose not her. The fact she's saying "need some luck in my life" to someone who is depressed from her rape and about to go and have an abortion
-9	negative	health Confessions	My parents always yelled at me and my   and I never understood why.Now I am pregnant and at 30 weeks my almost 3 year old daughter is pushing every button in the book. I have cried in front of her begging her to nap because she is so tired and so am i, and now I yell.I put her down for a nap, with her 18 month old sis, and my 3 year old opens the blind or turns on the light. Or she will flat out leave the room!I tell her after her nap she can have a movie and a cookie, i set it up nicely I have good intentions. But then I get ugly because she wants her way."Shakes her head" I hate me, when I do this.
-3	negative	health Confessions	My parents are alchoholics. I can't seem to say it enough. I want to scream it at them, I want to yell it in their faces. I still don't think they'd listen.
-2	negative	health Confessions	My parents for money. But they ruined my life. I am too old to blame them for everything, but they truly set me up to fail and be dependent.
-3	negative	health Confessions	My parents have lots and lots of money.  I am about 50 and have a good job and family.  My parents have always helped out with things like contributing to us buying a car, getting a new roof, etc. and over the past few years have given me $10,000 each year.  I am very appreciative but really would like more now, rather than 15 years from now after they pass away and my kids are gone.   For example, we need some major repairs on our house, we have a lot of medical bills, etc. and it would be really nice to not worry about those extras.   We do not live extravagantly, so there is little we could cut out.   They could easily afford it, so that is not the problem.  Should I bring it up and say it would be really helpful to be getting more now, rather than waiting for the inheritance?  Or would that be too crass and insult them?  I have a good relationship with them.
-9	negative	health Confessions	My parents have on me, understandably because I am an only child. I did not like being "limited". Told what to do, having to abide by rules, etc. Now that I am gone and live in the town I have wanted to for the last 3 years, I miss my Black Labrador more than anything. I really think the absence of her is causing me to go into a deep depression or sadness. Even when i'm sad, if I cuddle with my dog, see her "smiling" face, pet her velvety ears, it makes me happy because I know she loves me and I love her and we understand each other. She is my best friend and canine sibling. I wish I could adopt a labrador rescue, but unfortunately in my apartment we have a strict "No pets" policy. After realizing it would be cruel to sneak an animal into our building, I don't know what else to do about this situation. I cuddle with a stuffed animal but its not the same as her.Thank you for reading. friends Confessions
-7	negative	health Confessions	My period came early! I had a 24-day cycle the last two months & it's so cool because I LOVE LOVE LOVE my period so much!!! It started early this morning and woke me up with mild cramps and a bit of a mess, but it is so worth it! I got up and put on a long overnight maxi with wings and went back to bed feeling so good. )))
-9	negative	health Confessions	My power went out, winds were up to 40 mph and I got locked out in the front of my town house in my underwear. At leat I had a tank top on. Since it was so damn windy, no one could hear my banging on the door. The power was out so the doorbell didn't work. I was outside in that awesome weather for three hours! It was pretty crappy and I looked like a crazy cat lady by the time I got let inside. My hair was awesome looking after the extreme wind lol. Today we are on lightning, hail, thunderstorm warning and wind advisory (of course) and isolated tornado watch. Awesome possum!

-2	negative	health Confessions	My thirteen-year-old, Evette, is incredibly beautiful, with long blonde hair and a slender body. Her big sister, Alli, is seventeen, and looks nothing like her, short and overweight with dark oily skin and hair. People never assume that their sisters, and often ask me if I'm babysitting Eve (I look more like Alli).  Alli hates Eve, and often puts her down or calls her names, and today I've found that she has been hitting Eve whenever she is home alone with her and my five-year-old, Jesse. Please, please help. I don't know what to do.
-14	negative	health Confessions	My   took my cousin out this morning and he met his girlfriend. When he came home he mentioned how pretty she is (like a doll) and so on. I agree as I met her on facebook and I thinks shes great but I cant help but feel insulted. I have nothing against this girl and yet I have the feeling that there is this image my father sees me as and its not like this girl. I think Im jealous.
-3	negative	health Confessions	My   until 23 years of age, then my husband and father of my children for 23 years. Recently I reconnected with a love interrupted 23 years ago and I think he is THE CHARM. I have been so blessed. Don't ever give up. Love will be there!!!
-15	negative	health Confessions	My   wasn't present at either of her daughters weddings. One she didn't attend because she had to work (didnt approve) and the other she was barred from. I wonder what went thru her mind on those days. If she cried. If she tried to picture us in our dresses, the looks on our faces as we said our vows.  I've never asked. I think it might be too painful for her to talk about.  I'm crying as I type this. Seeing your child get married is very high on the list of must-dos for mothers, isn't it?
-4	negative	health Confessions	My whole, I can't remember one crush I've ever had. Not even on a famous actor or singer. Every girl in my school has a crush. Every once in a while my friends will ask me who my crush is. I'll tell them I don't have one. Then they will think I'm lying and keep asking me for the next week. For the 500,000,000,000,000,000,000th time I will simply say to them that I dont have a crush and then they will get really mad at me and they will think I don't trust them. I would like to have a crush but I don't. The boys in my school just arn't that attractive. And they still won't believe me. Then they'll call me, ask mee again, I'll say I don't have a crush and they start ignoring me and I loose my closest friends over just one question. I just don't know what to do.
-1	negative	health Confessions	My whole life for this. He wants to   & Iam taken
-2	negative	health Confessions	My whole life I have been nothing more than an unwanted burden. My heart is as big as Texas. I love and care deeply but I fail everyone. I hurt everyone because I am broken, sick and worthless. I should have done what I needed to tonight and never reached out. I'm sorry I hurt you too. funny Confessions
-7	negative	health Confessions	My whole life is one big problem.I am too scared to show people who I really am. What I really feel every single day is the exact opposite of what you would think by looking. Nobody has seen the real me because I feel like if I let people get that close they will take it from me. I am depressed and lonely all the time but Idon't let it show. I am very young so everybody would just say thatI'mbeing dramatic an to suck it up, but I think I actually need to have somebody closer. I am too scared and I know that if i choose the wrong person to trust i could spend the rest of my life like this.
-2	negative	health Confessions	my wife and I don't really like this guy. He's mean or anything like that, just a little creepy he's quiet, he keeps his eyes closed a lot, and occasionally says odd things like offering my wife a chocolate and then popping one in his mouth, closing his eyes, and moaning as he let it melt in his mouth.

-23	negative	health Confessions	My wife seems so.i dunno, off I guess.  She's depressed, I can tell that much.  What does she expect though?  I'm in the military, working 5 days a week, night shift too, and we only have one car now.  She's saying things like she's depressed and has nothing to do.  She has yet to find a job.  I bet once she does though she'll start making some friends. She doesn't wear her rings very much, i think this is the second full day I have seen her without them on.  I bet they are still in the bathroom, where she usually hangs them before she takes a shower. Thats another thing!  Just about every frickin time she's going to take a shower, she starts asking if I will take one with her!! She usually asks me when she KNOWS i"m in the middle of something!  Be it a game or a manga, anime, show.  Then when I tell her "I don't feel like it this time."  She starts acting all depressed again!  Seriously, whats with her??
-10	negative	health Confessions	My wife wants an open  . At first, I thought that she was joking, but then we sat and talked about it and she seems to be serious. She's even been trying to find me a girlfriend for when she isn't around. It's a lot to take in all at once, I think. She hasn't done anything except camera play, at least not that I am aware of, but says that she is going to visit her overseas boyfriend in a couple of months. She says she is going to sleep with him, and very well might do so. Strangely, I seem to be fine with it. It's possible that afterward I will feel awful about it, but at the moment I'm OK with the idea.
-4	negative	health Confessions	Need to be spanked, slapped, and put into time out more. Today a woman almost had an emotional breakdown because the two children she had wouldn't stop back-talking her (think the little kid from Cop Out, that steals cars). I could tell she was holding herself from popping them in the mouth or tying them to the shopping cart. I can understand over-doing the spanking/smacking' that's abuse. But really, some kids just need to be taught respect and discipline; words just don't work with some types of kids; especially since they are given a lot of material "needs" these days. There's no reason for constant bull-** of the mouth from kids who are car-less or puberty-less. Yes I just said, "purberty-less."
-2	negative	health Confessions	Never   anyone beside her. If i do, ill always feel the pain for having lost the most marvelous woman on heart, she is named With R as an initial. Shes a wonderful woman, she has a sweet heart, and is here for me always. I Love her heart. And also her lovely hairs, her penetrating glance, her majestrous neck, etc I will never forget her. I will always carry her in my heart, whichever part will be left.

-3	negative	health Confessions	Never forgive you, the truth I don't want to see you ever again, 2 months after the day I met you I told you about my exAnd the baby I was expecting that I didn't tell him about.. You got jelous and punched me on my belly until i lost the baby at the hospital I should have told the nurse what really happened and they would have locked you out right away but I didn't I hate you for killing my baby It was your fault.. Only because the baby wasn't yours Go to hel.. I hate you!!!
-3	negative	health Confessions	Never said i am the worldi realize hatred for my eyes for beneath them lyes the proof that they dont contain the worldbut nearly the universe for which all of your worlds could not exist without.
-11	negative	health Confessions	Never trust ANYONE who says "I swear" or "I promise" because this person can sense that you don't trust them and tries using this context as a weapon of manipulation. They are only trying to convince YOU of something for their own hidden intent. NEVER trust someone who uses CHARM and NICENESS either. Charm is only an ABILITY (a skill) it is NOT part of one's personality. CHARM is a verb--not a character trait. Unsolicited CHARM and NICENESS is a DECISION that is backed by hidden MOTIVE. It's funny that I write this because some people were telling me recently that I wasn't nice like the others using this skill and I have seen so many people on here and other social networks laying on that same thick charm and niceness--even people I know. I am glad that I am not this way because it is pathological. I look back on those people and think "What the hell were you thinking? Crazy!"

-25	negative	health Confessions	Nice picture. Nice body. Hands. Did you know I am a hands person? I look at hands. For some reason I memorize..hands. Why? Because they bring so much pleasure to a person. They bring happiness, love, hope.Hands can do mean things. I choose to see your hands as bringing good. I recognize those hands. Why? Because I have memorized every detail about you that I can. Why? Because I love you.as much as you love me.And you can keep walking. Away. Believing what a family member saidand that family member had an head injury and has not been the same since. He turned evil. Or whatever whispered lies about me in your ear is evil.How I love you. So much. And I know.when you comprehend how much I love you and need you..I know you will be here. I know it because.I know you love me. I know you love me every single time I hear you start your vehicle.Truly, madly, deeply, I love you and whatever it is I need to put "out there" I will.

-1	negative	health Confessions	Nobody is talking to me. I'm just really lonely. friends Confessions
-5	negative	health Confessions	Nobody is watching you through your mirror, your toilet, or even through these extremely silly and dull confessions. What paranoids need is a dose of the cold, hard reality that nobody cares about you enough to spend their time surveilling you. You're just not that important.
-17	negative	health Confessions	Nobody knows as well as me who you are. You had dark hair with red highlights. It was long, and wavy just like mine. You had these really dark eyes. They seemed to have seen a lot of things. You were thin, very thin. You always used to wear those shirts with buttons and long sleeves. I know you cared about me. I was your first born little girl. You liked to show me off to your friends sometimes. You even took me swimming and you were angry about something that day, but you were never mean to me. I even remember your first name. Someday, I will find you and find out why they took us away from you, but until then, I love you, mom.

If you felt I was your man, you woulda been here long ago, your going back to him on the sixth. And I know you want to be there so I am just standing aside.. You chose your life I will be ok

-5	negative	health Confessions	No, I'm sorry that's not it. I don't think you know how to love. You think you do, and maybe in your mind you do. But I'll tell you something sweetie, you're missing out on something that's beautiful. You've built so many walls that something I think you've isolated yourself. Go ahead and blame me for everything, We both know that your walls blind you.
-4	negative	health Confessions	No matter how I have tried and no matter what I do I will never have him. He doesnt want to be had. He just wants to live life recklessly like some young boy. He is just wasting my time and my life. He needs to go now so I will tell him to go. It is over.

-5	negative	health Confessions	Nope, I'm pale as a ghost and can't tan. I was guessing that you suffer a Vitamin D deficiency because you seem to spend an enormous amount of time here attempting to provoke others, which suggests that you don't have much going on in your life that would get you out of the house. You really should get about 15 minutes of sun exposure a day. At least take your bag of Doritos outside while you read your comic books, you know?
-2	negative	health Confessions	Nope, I'm too broken to be fixed. It's over, Walk on by..

-2	negative	health Confessions	Not for anyone else, but for me. I don't know if anyone can really understand what I'm saying. I believe in God and I love my family, in spite of everything that we've all been through. But I feel like I'm drowning bit by bit every year. I want to want to get up each day, but I just don't. I want to feel like each day matters. I don't know what I can do to change things around. I feel like I've been living like I'm drowning my whole life. I don't feel invested in anything. Maybe everyone feels this way. I hope not.

-10	negative	health Confessions	Nothing's sacred to me anymore. Nothing's even very special. I wonder what happened to that idealistic young man who wanted to be loved and understood more than anything else, who was vain and manipulative, but who seemed to be waiting for someone to take the time to be kind to him so he could blossom inside and have a shot at being the person he wanted to be. He's dead now. Whether I killed him or I merely took his place, I don't know. I'm a shell of a person, who can never get enough love or cause enough pain to feel satiated. Maybe I just need a good night's sleep or a stronger sense of purpose. I want to value things as more than sources of gratification. I want to value people beyond what they can do for me or provide me with. I want to stop trying to amuse myself and starting caring more. I want some of my naivete back.

-5	negative	health Confessions	not sure why you didn't allow comments..but here's mine!..as a woman, i am notobsessedwith marriage in itself. its not like im looking to get married to someone. a specific someone does trigger in me this desire to be a team.i wish to be with the one i love.. married or not.i can imagine that having a ceremony, a communion & celebration of that love as something intimate & wonderful.as to what being married means in our daily lives.. its up to lovers to decide that. social conventions do not fit all.

-2	negative	health Confessions	nomatter howhard my life gets, pain is always always always better than feeling nothing at all. Being numb to everything. being like a zombie. i cannot explain howterrifyingit is. Id rather have my arm ripped off than ever feel it again.

I got the feeling, granted I may be seriously wrong, that your mom's visit wasn't so unexpected- such a delightful lady by the way That you were talking as much and as fast as possible not only to include all info pertinent to work, but also to help us remained focused thus avoiding awkward silences. Everything went so well..better than I expected. But I cannnot help feeling this deep sense of lossIt hurts acknowledging that this is it. It took a gargantuan amount of composure on my part to not pay attention to my thoughts as we were talking goals and data. I will always be thankful for having had the pleasure and joy to meet you. This is so terribly difficult I do not recall having felt this way for anybody in such a long time. Where are these tears coming from?! Darn it.-

-13	negative	health Confessions	Of such wrongs?  It's as if I knew you loved me?   I didn't know for sure.  How could I be so fortunate??  How much grief & sorrow my heart holds,  only God knows.  My sorrow is based in trying to make up, trying to make better, asking forgiveness & trying to be worthy.  Even when you have been so wrong to accuse me, put me down then watch me cry.   You won't let me speak on my behalf for good reason..that's not right.  Believe what you want.  Doesn't matter what the truth is does it? Doesn't matter that my heart aches too. Never did.

I went to the end of my street in total darkness, it was the most fun thing I have ever done; I've done it twice actually. I almost got caught, but it was worth it. My parents are over protective and try and shield me from a lot of things, it just felt so good to rebel. They would never approve. I think that's why it was so fun.Yes, i do know the dangers, kidnapped, raped, even killed, possibly hit by a car but i still did it. What does that say? Am i really that bored at home that i would take those risks? I guess i really am

Well, hey I'm not one to judge on open adult content being that I work in the adult videochat industry but I didn't come here for that and now as soon as I get to my home computer I will be deleting these type of friends. I don't want to put my job in jeoporady. I rather save that activity for another time and place. Sorry to all my friends who I have deletebut it is what it is.

-17	negative	health Confessions	One day my mom came home from work. She told me she had been fired. I asked her if she wanted to talk about and she said no. So I went into my room and sat on my bed. Its not that I was worried about it because my grandpa takes care of me but I was kind of sad. I started to cry. She was in the room yelling and cursing at me because I was crying. That made me cry even MORE. Well I guess she got sick of hearing me cry and she hit me in the face with the back of her. Well I git mad and hit her back in the face. I don't know if it was a reflex or if I did it intentionally. I started to cry even more. She got up and left out of my room. That day my grandpa came back to get me. He asked what was wrong and I told him. He told me to promise to GOD that I would never do again. I told my mom sorry and she gradually accepted my apology. I never hit. My mom again no matter how mad she made me.

-2	negative	health Confessions	one more try. That's a bunch of bs. That's what someone says who wants to draw attention away from their own contribution to failure. What a sh* way to go out. Way to dump on the one you love. That's like saying F* for not being able to pull 100% for the both of us. Whoever you let go just got lucky. Oh, and since I have the opportunity, you can shove your prayers right up your .

I just racked up a 35 thousand dollar bill because of viral meningitis. I don't want to go see the doctor because of these material reasons.

-3	negative	health Confessions	One thing I've always wanted to try: Modelling. I'm scared to try, because I'm not exactly tall. Look at my picture. Am I good enough? Or aren't I. That's what I always ask myself. I'm just so afraid to fail. I'm afraid to try. friends Confessions
-6	negative	health Confessions	One time I submitted a   where I was just so sad and literally crying in front of my laptop. Then, the post record among others some 'teehee' and 'you rock'. I know the reactions are the result of a bug but it feels like no one is taking me seriously, or worse, listening to me. That's how I sometimes feel with the bugged reactions.I would refresh the page over and over again and look at it bitterly. An imaginary audience humoring me. friends Confessions

-3	negative	health Confessions	Only LOVE and unity matter. Stop comparing yourself to others or wondering if you are "valued" or "as good as". Approach life and others as WHOLE, being nothing and needing nothing. Others will judge. Because they haven't learned yet. And you will confound them. Because they will fear you. Everything in you - thoughts, feelings, brainpower, energy, attitude - equals a certain power.You can use it to HURT or to SUPPORT. Use it to hurt, and you hurt yourself and all of humankind. Use your power to support, and you RAISE yourself, others, and all of humankind. Make the RIGHT CHOICE and encourage others to do the same. If you care about impressions, make a choice to stand out as the FAIR, COOL, SMART and ACCEPTING person.Theperson with COURAGE who befriends "ugly", "retarded", "loser" souls who are NOT except in the eyes and cold hearts of ignorant and immature people.
-5	negative	health Confessions	On most forms now, all but Caucasian (white) are based on region. Most ask if you are: -White -Pacific Islander -Asian -Native American -African or African American Do you see what I see? Shouldn't White be changed to European or European American? Race shouldn't be based on skin color. I have black friends who from Cuba who consider themselves Hispanic, and Asian friends from the far west of Asia who consider themselves more Middle Eastern than Chinese.
-6	negative	health Confessions	On Thursday night I found out that my boyfriend of one year has been married for 2 years not. His wife still lives in Pakistan.

-6	negative	health Confessions	Our neighbor with the van is standing at his window with his blinds open, but not pulled up, staring into our house BLATANTLY with his fingers pulling the blinds apart so that he can see better. We all freak out just a little, because the apartment complex is only like 40 feet away, and that was SUPER creepy. But we're like, um, okay, whatever, I'm sure he's not looking at us. Okay. We retreat. This continues for hours. Like 6 hours.
-3	negative	health Confessions	Our spiritual connection is gone. Our emotional connection is gone. The things that I have been holding onto are merely memories of a time when I believed in you.
-7	negative	health Confessions	Over the last few months I lost sight of a truth that I learned over the course of my life. The truth that I will never find love. I thought because a few women showed interest I might find happiness. And I did for a few moments. Then reality came back. And my heart was destroyed. And if it wasn't because of a good friend, whom I love, I would be dead. My sorrow almost got the best of me last night. But, now I don't feel anything. I feel empty. And now I see the truth once more. That my life is one of loneliness. Devoid of love.
-8	negative	health Confessions	Part one had me worrying I was preggers after a one night affair in Dec. I'd had my period that month and January and am certain not in February. As I approached the second month w/out seeing a flow, I posted my concern. At 48 and married, having no intimacy w the husband in over a year, a pregnancy would be quite the scandal in a small town.I will NEVER put myself in a position to worry again - a promise I've made. This morning I woke up to the blessed red tide. Thank God!

-14	negative	health Confessions	People can talk about forgiveness all they like, but when it comes down to it they prove time and time again that they don't have the heart or the strength for it."oh God please come punish these people who hurt me because I want to take pleasure from their painI think that is the only way I can let my pain go""oh God please punish these people I call 'evil' because I can't be bothered to understand them and I don't have the heart and soul to help them.""God, please punish the wicked because I deem them unworthy to heal""God please punish the sinful because I don't have the will to bring light to the world.""God please punish the bad souls because 'eye for an eye' is the only thing I know.""God please smite these evil people because harming someone is clearly the answer to my pain""Godthis guy killed my boy so I want him tortured for all eternitythat doesn't make me a bad person because different rules apply to me"Take your pick of BS.

I am not going to end it all, just want to find some new happiness, if it even exists. I still love you tara, and I love you jake, my son.
-2	negative	health Confessions	People who just bash confessions on Abortion or Miscarriage baffle me. This is a support center, a place where many come to seek comfort when they may or may not be able to do it in the outside world. You got a problem with a woman's decision to look after her own body, her own temple, regardless of her reasons? Go join one of those "Pro Life" or "I hate Abortion" groups on here. Pour out your opinions there like the rest of us sane folk do. But don't you d a r e come here and try to tear a woman down for a choice she made in regards to her own well- being. Take that playground bullfukery someplace else.

-8	negative	health Confessions	Put down your arms you silly man and stop trying to call the shots, stop trying to work things out because you are missing a lot of information. I know this is hard but if you can do this I believe it will be good for you. Give yourself a break because God is going to win, maybe I can visit you sometime and I can show you how wrong you are about me. I doubt there would be much point in this though, you see what you want to see.

As soon as he calls, Im rite there..No matter what. Im not even sure if I really want him..Maybe its bc hes taken.I mean, what if he wasnt?..Would I still want him?

-3	negative	health Confessions	Should I Smile Because You're My Friend Or Cry Because Thats All We'll Ever Be?"
-4	negative	health Confessions	should not keep track of all the past wrongs. If we are in harmony with one another, we should be able to forgive. Without compassion there is no kindness or friendship. A flame that is put out, has lost it's desire to love. Love dies when it is not nurtured. funny Confessions
-20	negative	health Confessions	sick of this stupid mis-communicationI am slightly deaf but my mother is profoundly deaf and stupidshe pretends to hear me and acts vague and I can tell she has not understood or heard a thingbut she pretends to have instead of saying "I can't hear you" I am suppose to guess she can't hearand then she acts dumb. and then comes over too close for comfort and I say to herin over pronounced words for her to hearis it me or what??? can't people speak up and bloody communicateif they can't hear say soIm sick of her simple ways and intrusions  and agressionmy dad is the same and my sister is much the sameall you ever get is "sorry" when she bounces off you in the bathroomhow backward is all this going?

-13	negative	health Confessions	Simply in your presence, I am complete. 41001 reasons for me to smile when you are around. You are the best drug God ever invented. Life handed me ups and downs, you handed me just ups. I could think of you for an eternity and never run out of reasons to love you. The sad reality of you being gone only makes me love you more. If I could find a way, I'd give you the world, tell you how sorry I am, hold you forever, show you what I should have shown you back then. Time heals all wounds, but strengthens all bonds. Though ten years removed, Im closer to you today than ever. If only you knew it.
-11	negative	health Confessions	Since nobody knows who i am i feel like confessing like lightning. but i know that would take up too much space. i want to confess my deepest darkest secrets. I really am insane and i know it. but i like it when people call me crazy. even though its true. Whats even weirder is even though i feel like an outcast i think everyone else makes no sense. i am a jerk because noone can convince me to change. but i pretend like i am changed. Really the people i know are so predictible i feel trapped to be here. im like super insane. i dont know how these people function so simply. when i say here i mean where i live.
-8	negative	health Confessions	Sitting next to you today felt like sitting next to a glacier. Thanks for remaining neutral and aloof.It did help.Oh, and by the way, was that a genuine smile you sported this morning?Just so youknowI am trying. I really am. 
-5	negative	health Confessions	S like living in suppression off society. You bear "the flag" of oppression . Im Sad for these persons that bears it too.. Nobody wanna bear that flag saying  like " look at here, its a flag-bearer !" Im better off playing my xbox .. I guess . And let this world goes round without me getting hurt everytime i try to blend in that society.
-8	negative	health Confessions	Slowly I'm feeling like I am becoming dependant on those who actually have money. This is because of my growing anxiety to work anywhere, which is also affecting my choice of deciding whether or not I should go onto my University course.Bloody hell, it's eating me.
-2	negative	health Confessions	smaller nose and bigger eyes  I have kinda thick lips
-8	negative	health Confessions	So a few people in my husband's family are trying to write books about the childhood abuse they suffered. Thing is.. the stuff they've told me doesn't sound like abuse. It sounds like normal parenting. For the most part. Every parent makes mistakes. Every parent. They have no relationship with their parents now. I don't think it's due to the abuse.more like the parents just aren't good enough for them. The kids have done better than their mom and dad. They feel ashamed of them. I could never tell husband this. We'd be heading for divorce. I love him but he's an arrogant  sometimes. This is going to be something they can't take back. I wish they would reconsider.
-11	negative	health Confessions	So here's the thing. I recently turned 24 and I've never been kissed. No this is not Drew Barrymore from the movie! haha but in all seriousness I find this a very sad fact. Most people my age have at least been kissed once. It's embarrassing because the factors that play into my lack of..I guess you could say experience are not all that common..well common for most people. I'm Middle Eastern and being a 24 year old female who's never been kissed is sadly common among us. Not only that but my dad is one of those "if I find out you have a boyfriend I will kill him and then you" types. This is also common in my culture. I'm tired of this because I long for a connection with a guy who I could be with and finally kiss. Sometimes being a girl really blows, and most times being an Arabic girl is the toughest, loneliest thing ever.
-5	negative	health Confessions	so he was never into me. so what?! so why do i care so much? so why can't i stop wondering what i did wrong and what is wrong with me physically? i feel really bad about myself. some girls everyone likes them because they are so beautiful me no one likes me just for s3x. i know! i'll get plastic surgery. i just wish someone would like and love me as i am now. friends Confessions
-4	negative	health Confessions	So I break from this site after I realized that I was done with the BS (including the BS people) that came along with it. However, I thought I would take a break, from taking a break and see what's been going. Hope all are well.
-12	negative	health Confessions	So, I broke up with my ex-boyfriend last week and, I feel bad. Not about the fact that I broke up with him(sounds bad, I know). But, the fact that when we were together, I couldn't wait to hear his voice and, I felt like I really liked him but, now that we've broken up, the last time I spoke to him was last week and, I haven't had the urge to anything to hear his voice again and, I don't really feel like I miss him. And, when we had broken up, he told me that he would always love and never stop loving me. Mind you it wasn't a long relationship, it was less than six months. But, I feel terrible that he's heart broken and, I'm not feeling any sorrow or regret. I'm starting to wonder if I ever really liked him in the first place. I feel bad.
-5	negative	health Confessions	So I go out to eat tonight for my son's birhtday with my in-laws and my husband (separated). Is it pathetic to say that I miss him. I was looking forward to seeing him. Yet in conversation I feel like I don't even know him. I felt like he was being distant and I am sure he was. This sucks! And what is more pathetic is that I told him I miss him as he gives me a hug goodbye. This really sucks!!
-1	negative	health Confessions	So..I have a hard time sometimes with jealousy.and right now is one of those times.not really sure how to get past it but i guess i just have to friends Confessions
-22	negative	health Confessions	So, I have an immediate family member and her three kids staying in my home for the past three months rent free. All I ask is to watch your kids your self and to help with the groceries. Neither has she done on a regular basis. She smokes all of her money. She has no job--the only income she receives is Child Support and Food Stamps but she manages to smoke through all of it. This chick is a Byrd, she didn't buy her kids school clothes for the fall but has no bills. She gets on FB posting messages, "Just help me damn, I'm in need." I got tired of her talking behind my back when I'm helping her and being taken advantage of so once she got housing and had an apartment on the 1st of the month paying GET THIS paying $35.00 a month but does not leave I was about ready to blow. So I decided not to buy groceries which put my own in a little pickle but it was a means to an end. Last night she slept in her own apartment--no food.
-3	negative	health Confessions	So I have been dating this amazing woman for a while, I have fallen completely head over heals for her, she is my every thing, my every thought my ever being. She is everything I thought I should feel, but could never find.Last week she told me she wants to transition into a man.I don't know how I feel, I have never been with a man, never imagined being with a man.Any advice would be greatly appreciated.
-17	negative	health Confessions	So I have been with my girlfriend for 8 months now, And I met her for the first time at our 3 month mark. After that meeting, being away from her wasnt that hard. But two months late i went to see her again and I ended up staying about a month and a half. Leaving her almost killed me, I cried the few days before I left her(in front of her) and definatly on the train ride home and often since then. This last time has been sooo hard being away from her. I usually dont get all sad until I see a picture of her/us or when we skype together. And I feel bad for always being sad when we skype. I know Im going to stay with her, I am not giving up, I just want to know If anyone else is going throuhg what I am, Can anyone offer my advice or tips. I need some positive things right now. Like stories of people going through this same thing. And why is it so different this time?

You have received a trophy for being a budding author!"Well, just when I thought life sucked I'm the proud owner of a internet trophy.
-16	negative	health Confessions	So, I'm 21 and by no means ready to have children yet but when the time comes it'll be so sweet =]My Dad was such a douche while I was growing up and needed him the most.. I think that's probably where the inspiration comes from.I want to be nothing like him. In fact; I'm already much more of a man than he'll ever be..I see SO many guys walk out of a relationship because of a pregnancy.. I don't know if it's fear or they're really just that pathetic, it's frustrating though.People really don't realize how important the role of a "Father" is to a child.. even though my Dad was a doucher, I remember being so excited every time I'd hear the door open knowing it was him returning from work. When you're that young that man is a SAINT lol he's meant to be your hero.. just wish more people realized that.Any who, to whoever, if anyone read this, sorry for the rant :P just needed to get it off of my chest.Cheers,Michael friends Confessions
-6	negative	health Confessions	So I'm a webcam model, and I was been playful today, when I looked at my fingers I was bleeding. At least the guys who saw it were really cool about it they were like don't worry things happen. But I'm still so embarrased I cant get it off my mind

-6	negative	health Confessions	so in   with you.it's like love overflows from every pour in my body..and all if it is for you. Just thinking of it can make me pretty emotional, pretty quick. I feel so very much..I admit, I keep it in reserve. i don't want you to be put on the spot or uncomfortable in any way.This, to me is no ordinary love. This love is willing to give or hold in reserve as much or as little as you want. I think that's the best way to have things.I can't explain it, but, maybe I don't want to be too forward. However, my feelings for you are very, very intense and deep. I say this only because I hide my emotions and want to be respectfulOurs is like a dance. You lead and I'll follow.
-10	negative	health Confessions	So its been around six months I have been working for a company, very glad I actually got a job since things in this economy are not at its best with recent graduates. I have a really good feeling that the abilities I am learning in this workplace and online will help me begin making a career out of it. My wish is to go up in a company and have the chance to actually be the leader I am. By analyzing the behaviors, requirements and way of thinking of others I can tell that I have a very good chance to actually do so in a not so distant future. Opportunities are not everywhere, from that I can say, but I believe I will be one of the few who will be successful and have the chance to help as many people as I possibly can! :P
-10	negative	health Confessions	So its been years since I've been in a relationship. And I really haven't recovered from it. I hardened up from the experience and lived my life in accordance. When times really fought against my favor, i just remembered, I am single and will not have to experience any pain like i had in the past. But lately ,especially getting older, it's stuck in the back of my mind. It picks away at times causing meunneededpressure or stress, forcing me to be irritable towards people. But when I thought clearly on this, I guess I really do want one, I'm just not determined or brave enough to get back into the scene.
-9	negative	health Confessions	So lonely, angry, hurt and numb I could cry.  I don't understand why he loves me one day & the next day he accuses me of being unfaithful.  I not been unfaithful.  Even though he has not asked me to be his, I still act as if.   All I've done is wait..for him to give me a little bit of his time & I'm darn happy when he does.  I can't take the false accusations, the put downs and the loneliness is killing me.  I don't know who has treated him so badly that he can't see when someone loves him more than life itself & would do anything to make him happy, but I would & I do love him.    He can't understand that I would not ever be unfaithful.he's labeling me with the standards others keep.   That's someone else.  That's not me.   God I've waited so long & I've missed him terribly.   I'm devistated cause I know it's not gonna work.  He just will not believe in me or my word.  My past backs every promise I make.I've never dishonored anyone I was with.   I just, damn it love him.
-8	negative	health Confessions	So many miles to keep me from you and yet I feel so close. Through online chats I know you. Every piece of you shows me the peace of you. Take away this screen between us and we could walk, we could talk forever. Sadly, that is not the way we are meant to be in this life. Instead there is a constant separation of you from me, and selfishly I want to know you better, to feel you more, to know your touch. So, today I've been sitting here trying to figure out a way to span these miles of digital space and touch you through the screen. friends Confessions
-16	negative	health Confessions	So many people tell me that I'm a good mom. But anyone that has ever lived in the same household as me knows I'm a neurotic ** and my kids hate me.Most of the time,I know when I'm being unreasonable but I cannot help it. One example,after my first parent/teacher conference with my daughter, (when my daughter was in kindergarten), I realized she wasn't at the top of her class. So,I basically told herthat she was beyond my helpand I'm not wasting my time. I said it in a really nice way, something along the lines of "You're a fish and fish can't fly, lets focus on your other strengths." But I gave up hope for academic success at that point. She's going into 8th grade andnow gets C's and D's and I really don't care. She's an athlete and is only allowed to focus on horseback riding and soccer. friends Confessions
-1	negative	health Confessions	Some of you people are so dumb.if anyone looks at your profile that YOU don't want to see it, it's stalking? It's an effin profile! It's built for people to look at.. Why are you people so stupid?
-3	negative	health Confessions	someone writing   letters, friendly sentimental ones, using the word for ofter (i.e for I care, for I am..for blah blah blah) it amused me, just like the word truly is used by the same individual often. But they love using those particular words often and it is a personal thing I can't really have an opinion on. That would be overbearing and uncalled for.
-2	negative	health Confessions	someonehurt you so bad andcaused so much drama and discord that you would spend hour's on annon site to MAKE SURE they get the point? Which the point is what exactly?
-16	negative	health Confessions	Some remarkable things happened today. I asked God to use me and he put me to the test. Let's just say that I stepped out of my comfort zone and became a leader today in a way I never would have expected. It is the little things that can matter most and impact peoples lives. All we have to do is obey and let down our guard. While everyone was sitting there judging and doing nothing I reached out and helped instead. It created smiles and even turned a once man who was rolling his eyes and shaking his head into someone who decided to help. 
-2	negative	health Confessions	something light. Sure let's watch Benji. No harm there. AAAaarrrrrrggggg! Does everything HAVE to be about love. Benji had a girlfriend?? I don't remember that! Everybody is in love but me :-(
-8	negative	health Confessions	Something must be wrong with me, I find myself thinking about infidelity more than anyone should. My husband is in the Navy and we have been apart most of our marriage, the loneliness is unbearable sometimes. Though I know I would never cheat, it crosses my mind and I feel so guilty. He was unfaithful before we were married, but he has done so much to earn my trust again. It feels like I am  stabbing him in the back with these thoughts.
-2	negative	health Confessions	Sometime at nite lay in  bed thinking about her,the way she smile and the way she laugh at my jokes.but I know things can never  be the same. We are friends now,nomore love making..nomore cuddlingnomore nothing..we just friend nowI miss her and love her
-3	negative	health Confessions	Sometimes I am desperate,I miss you.I want to text you.But your last words echoes in my ears.I am supposed to help you to get over me.I don't want to weaken your stand,by sending a text after holding back for a long time.Though I have forced myself to maintain silence for a reasonably long time,know that there wasn't a single moment when you were not in my thoughts. friends Confessions
-4	negative	health Confessions	sometimes i dont know if its me thats the problem . the one thats sabotageing my own happiness. if it is mewhy ,do i not think i deserve it? is it a way to get out before someone else hurts me? or the sadest thought ..am i not able to know love
-6	negative	health Confessions	SOME TIMES I FEEL LIKE I AM NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR MY KIDS. I DONT ALWAYS FEEL LIKE A GOOD MOM. I THINK THAT I SLACK SOME TIMES. MY WORST FEAR IS TO HAVE MY KIDS LOOK AT ME THE WAY I LOOK AT MY MOM. WHY DO I FEEL LIKE A CRAP MOM ?WHY DONT I EVER FEEL LIKE I AM DOING MY BEST? I REALLY NEED TO FIGURE THIS OUTOTHERWISE I COULD BE HURTING THEM.
-8	negative	health Confessions	Sometimes i think about all the pain the misery i have caused people in the last 10 years. Then i think that im probably going to live for at least another 50 so i multiply that pain and misery by 5. Now what i come up with, i believe to be greater then the amount of mourning my friends and family would have to go through if i passed away. The conclusion i can bring from this is that the world would be a better place without me. Maybe if i could explain that to them in ways they would understand i can pass without causing too much of a stir.
-1	negative	health Confessions	Sometimes I think about what my life would have been like had I not gotten married so young. I really regret it every once in a while. I love you with all my heart but I feel like my life could have been so much farther along by now. I feel terrible even writing this here. My life could have been betterI'm sorry I feel this way sometimes. I'm sorry
-5	negative	health Confessions	sometimes i think my dad molested me, but i can't tell if i am just trying to find an excuse for my problems or it did happen and i blocked out the memories. i literally have no evidence towards it, but always wonder if it did happen. then i feel awful when i think of my sweet dad possibly doing that. is it common for people to get an idea and start to believe it themselves and they just think they they tried forgetting the memories?
-3	negative	health Confessions	Sometimes I will be overwhelmed with the desire to do "it" with a total stranger. Or to expose myself to a total stranger. Or be touched in public by a total stranger. I will dress in such a way that suggests this and will walk around hoping someone touches me. I will meet someone on the internet and do "it" with them. Not even know their name. Then after a couple months I can't believe what I was doing, what I was thinking. I feel so bad and ashamed. But then sometime down the road the whole thing repeats again. What is wrong with me? When I don't have these episodes I tend to have absolutely no desire at all.
-6	negative	health Confessions	sometimes i wish i was anorexic i know that sounds wrong but if it could help me kick my weight i would do it. I mean i tried to do it one day but at the end of the day i had horrible stomach cramps. i want to be 115 like my mom not 160 and 4''11. i just want to be skinny. 
-2	negative	health Confessions	Sometimes I wish my husband had succeeded in killing himself.  We've been seperated for 7 years and he won't give me a divorce.  I really want to marry my fiance.  Of course I don't want my ex dead, but sometimes I just think it would be easier for me if he had actually managed to kill himself.

-4	negative	health Confessions	Some would put their faith above everything and everyone here on Earth. Brush off any thought that maybe forcing their beliefs on others isn't helping but hurting. I can't get away from them..I feel like I'm suffocating.. If any loving Christians out there would like to comment, I'd appreciate that..Right now I really need to be reminded that not everyone is like that.
-1	negative	health Confessions	So much going off in my mind at one time. Sometimes I think my heads going to pop off like a cork. Im emotionally drained. Im pretty good at being told what to do and work better that way, but when you cant be told what you should be thinking and feeling, im pretty stumped. I just wish it could all be sorted out, as for now, im just going to keep smiling, and pretend I know exactly whats going on.

I know that he's not worth my tears and that I can find someone better, but I feel awful. I don't know how to feel or what to say. How could he hang out with his ex after all we've been through? I told him about my depression, about how my dad abused me. We've cuddled, we kissed, etc. I'm an idiot

-5	negative	health Confessions	So there's this young ish teacher at my school. When I first saw him, I thought to myself " is that a student? he's hot" But unfortunately he was not. He doesn't actually teach me for any subjects, he teaches the lower school; I'm a senior. The other day, I saw him at the beach and dammmm!

-3	negative	health Confessions	Surprisingly after I drink too much I am very happy to sleep in my car.  Tonight I slept for an hour and a half until I was safe to drive.  It is almost like camping except for using the heater just before my nap.
-5	negative	health Confessions	Surrounded by all these people, and yet having absolutely no one to confess your problems to.I feel so empty, and cliche as it sounds, no one can understand me.My problems? I'm "making it sound worse than it is."Thanks, it takes so much for me to open up, and yet everytime I do, I get shut down and told to stop being a whiny little girl.Thing is, I'm hurting. I'm hurt and yet no one believes this.It just hurts.

-1	negative	health Confessions	tests are putting vulnerable children under pressure. Why don't we go back to a system where teachers can 'teach' without all the political red tape. I feel sorry for the children who attend school these days.
-8	negative	health Confessions	that I am glad I let go. I am drowning and love you to much to take me down with me. I will always love you. I wish that I had been more stable emotionally. I do know what I had and lost. I'm not blind. You just deserve better. For me, I am selfish and want you in my life. But it's what I want for you that will win the battle. Go. Be happy. Be healthy. Be all you can be. Remember our fun times. Our peaceful moments.

-6	negative	health Confessions	that I have a serious heart condition. It runs in my family. That's why my father and brother died so early in life. UghI have the same condition.

-2	negative	health Confessions	that i have more money than my parents, even though i work less hours for less pay.
-3	negative	health Confessions	That I know. My life is altered forever but change is good. I try to do things differently everyday in my life now to feel more alive. My heart is still raw but I've learned that it's a way of life for me now, I accept it. I wish we could have connected but wishing will never making it happen. The reality is harsh and cold and unloving. The reality will pull me under and drown me if I face it full on. There was amazing beauty in that world with you at one one time, it will never be again. I know this to be true now.

-5	negative	health Confessions	thatsfound that's how I feel, I feel like I'm lost and noone can find me. Yah I get happy and I have fun and laugh and joke ad stuff. You could never tell I feel like this from the outside. Only my true best friend knows. I feel like I'm in a daze, that's the best way to decribe it. Like today I make myself realize that my cat that ran away isn't coming back. And I feel even more lost. It's like every time I lose something dear to me I get even farther lost in the woods. And I can't get out.  I never feel sane. And noone can help.
-1	negative	health Confessions	that's hilarious since I've wanted nothing to do with you for months.

-10	negative	health Confessions	That's what you taught me,  .  You think no one will feel sorry for me if you try to hurt me? Thank you for painting me as some desperate lovesick fool. Surely my fondness for you wasn't because you regularly told me that you would choose me over your current other and that I was SO much better than mine. You always wondered how the mean one kept me. I was so touched when you swore that you seriously couldn't find anything wrong with me. What a compliment to hear that I am also a standout in my profession, best darn candidate for the job. Oh, and my eyes! My hair. My lips. My body. Those were only just outdone by my terrific sense of humor, my big brain and my kind heart. Gosh, you swept this attention starved clinger off my feet. You must do this ALL the time!
-2	negative	health Confessions	that the internet is way better than real life. No one gets to see me, I am more secure, no social anxiety.
-7	negative	health Confessions	That the Ruby Crystals of Burma are not a reliable source of energy to make more Energon Cubes. It's hard being Soundwave sometimes. Megatron looks up to me for help, but I am still afraid of that guy he's totally insane. I could always have Starscream tell him about the crystals Megatron hates him and he's a huge * anyway.
-15	negative	health Confessions	That, to you, he will always come first. I will always be second best. You may love me, but you love him more. I may be important to you, but he's more important to you. That's how it always will be. I will never surpass him in significance. You two have too much history. I could never compete with that. All this just makes me think it wasn't meant to be. I would like to be your friend, but not your lover. I couldn't help but worry about your husband as you spent hours smiling, blushing and flirting with me. You're an amazing woman, perhaps the most amazing I've ever known. I love you and do not want to lose you. But I feel as though I already have. I lost this battle the day I met you.
-2	negative	health Confessions	that was way back last year huh."lame fake a ss anons".interesting. I get what you're really venting about though.

-4	negative	health Confessions	that you slept with her. I should have just given it up. It bothers me, though, how easily I've forgiven you.
-4	negative	health Confessions	that you   someone, there is nothing one can do to STOP this incredible feeling. This kind of LOVE consumes you and you are left longing formore. The one you want unfortunately can not be the ONE you can have. This is when you feel like you were born in the wrong era at the wrong place and time. The fact that we shared an intimate moment is still enough to keep me goingNext time our stars collide, we will both be ready for one another.
-6	negative	health Confessions	The 27th of every month does. I'd say like the famous song does that I found out about you, but you found out about me. Go figure friends Confessions
-13	negative	health Confessions	The day you said you didnt trust me said I was a liar said it was all my fault was the day it ended. It was two years ago sunday, happy anniversary, its taken everyday of these two years to get over what you did. Youll never really know what you caused or how you hurt me. Trust begets trust I never lied to you because I trusted you and only you. I never trusted easily I never trusted anyone as much as I trusted you. I'll never trust again.
-14	negative	health Confessions	The doctors think my mom might have  , and it scares me so much because what if she does and she dies? They said that they're going to remove half her thyroid and test it to see if it's cancerous. I know I shouldn't be freaking out and crying at work, but it keeps running through my head. Cancer. Cancer. Cancer. My mom is such a great lady and she doesn't deserve this, I wish that I could take everything bad on myself. I wish I could have cancer instead of potentially my mom. They won't know until the end of this month if she does, and I'm hoping and praying that her results turn out okay.
-9	negative	health Confessions	The doctor told me that douching once after a period is the only safe thing to do as it destroys the natural good bacteria. That may be why she smells naturally. Doc said the v jay is self cleansing like the eye ball. The only reason products sell over the counter is because people buy it and the manufacturers want money.
-2	negative	health Confessions	the fake me is the me they want, they want a hero, not a coward.
-3	negative	health Confessions	The feeling is coming back again. The feeling I've been dreading. I want to be with you again. 
-5	negative	health Confessions	The first   people should ask themselves is this: Am I a healing presence in this world or am I am hurting one?   Many times our love affair with this world begins with a broken heart so I ask you to forgive those who have hurt your and heal them with your forgiveness. It all starts with you.
-2	negative	health Confessions	The guy I babysit,for has been molesting me.I'm 12, he's long time friends with my parents.He says he'll stop..known him since I was a baby!
-10	negative	health Confessions	The guy I   just asked someone else out. it is all my fault. i wouldn't split up with the guy i'm with (which I don't truly love) and now i've gone and lost the one true constant in my life. my best friend and the person i have always envisaged my happy ever after with. he always told me I was perfect, but she's really skinny and what not, and probably really fun to be around even though she might be nice i can't help but automatically harbour ill feelings towards her. sh's taken my soulmate. ='[ i'm listening to him talk on the phone about how wonderful she is and not a week ago he was lay next to me saying he wanted me to be his wife and that he loved me. this is bullshit and it feels like my hearts tearing in two friends Confessions

-4	negative	health Confessions	The IB class is supposed to have the top students of the school, nothing but the best. Don't believe me, then look it up online. But today Irealizedjust how intelligence poor the top 10 percent can be They actually.they actually laughed? at a really animatedconversation about the cosmos todayThese kidsthey just aren't trying to learn for the right reasonsThey just want the money and statusWho cares about real education anymore? (The teacher, the smartest kidand me :/).I still can't believe they laughedDumb
-15	negative	health Confessions	The  , i ever experienced was with a boy who continuously preceded to emotionally abuse me. I loved him so much that, i allowed myself to feel unworthy, useless; because ultimately i believed that he was the best i could get. He had his moments though, moments that showcased his affection for me, moments that made me believe or keep believing. Although his mean side was horrible, unforgiving and unfair.I've currently found the strength to say no to him. The lingering question that keeps blurring my thoughts is, how can i love a man who treated me so badly? what does that say about me? is it just simply pathetic on my behalf?i don't have the answers for why I'm feeling the way i do. i can't have men look at me anymore without me over thinking the fact that I'm just bluntly not good enough.how do i start to feel again?
-1	negative	health Confessions	The   inside is forever silent, it whispers inside my heart, I wish you could hear the emotions running through me. I wish I knew what you were thinkingit leaves me wondering if I could ever share this with you. I WANT to share all of this with you. I just wish you could feel what I feel and listen to my heart. friends Confessions
-2	negative	health Confessions	the   is pretty conventional, but it hurts just the same: I basically pushed away and hurt a good woman who was probably the best thing that ever happened to me. I'm just an idiot and I'm really missing her now.
-13	negative	health Confessions	The last cellphone acid burned my ear before it broke. Then, it "melted", wellbroke into pieces. My phone was already saying "Charging caused by OVP". I wasn't gonna renew the minutes for the next month, but I did because my family wanted to stay in contact with me.  The dumb AT&T technician wouldn't honor my warranty. He said that phone overheat wouldn't cause it to break, & he thought I broke it on purpose. He just pretended to be that way for an excuse to not honor my warranty. Cell phone companies are a scam! I vow to NEVER buy a cellphone again for the REST of my life! Also, saves me $50/month.
-2	negative	health Confessions	The leotard freak is a chick? Coulda fooled me.
-3	negative	health Confessions	The little girl I knew the sad young woman I should have known better But now that your smile and vivacity has been completely and fatally eclipsed by your pain, the music is gone too
-9	negative	health Confessions	The man I have held so close in my heart told me yesterday that he sees me like a sister. At that moment, my heart shattered and fell like confetti through my body. I don't think he realises what he's done. At the exact same time, my first love, a man I have not seen in 5 years, the one I thought I'd never get over, the one I got over by falling in love with the guy who broke my heart, leaves me a message asking me out on a date later this week. Life is so ironic.
-1	negative	health Confessions	The mental hospital a bit, i miss someone there, chances are that they are not there anymore *sigh*
-9	negative	health Confessions	The most embaressing thing hat ever happened to me was my first day of middle school. I was getting changed after my first gym class. I wore a tweety-bird t-shirt (lame) and jean shorts (lame). I remember all of the kids staring at me and giggling. But I couldn't figure out what they were looking at. I went home that day and looked in the mirror. My shirt was on backwards and my shorts zipper was unzipped! I walked around the WHOLE day looking like that!
-9	negative	health Confessions	Then being apart will make it stronger. Does absence make the heart grow fonder ?Do you miss me tonight ? There are special things that remind me of you. Even though we are far apart this week, I'm always wondering what you are doing and thinking about. At night, you are the last thing I think of before falling asleep. This is just another test of our love, we have already passed a few in the past 4 months.I long to feel your touch and hear your voice. Sweet dreams my love

-2	negative	health Confessions	The only thing my ex left was his cologne, so I spray his pillow every night and pretend he is still here so I can sleep.
-1	negative	health Confessions	The only things keeping me from dumping my boyfriend is that he'll cry, and my mom adores him. I don't even like him anymore.
-1	negative	health Confessions	The only thing that is keeping me alive right now is that tiny bit of hope that in a few years, it will all get better. Apologise for the depressing note!
-6	negative	health Confessions	The other night I said some things, one of them was something that God placed on my heart. Now I am feeling that despite the fact you said it was fine, it isn't.I hate when we fight and I don't know what to do or say. I have asked God to forgive me, now can you be man enough to also forgive?Please don't throw away the things that we love, but especially each other. I am not perfect, never have been and never will.

-4	negative	health Confessions	there is always a helicopter flying low over where i live. They are really loud and they fly in a circle for like 30 minute intervals throughout the night. I swear my backyard must be full of criminals with all these choppers whizzing by.
-5	negative	health Confessions	There is a reason we met. I was meant to witness the worst family ever. But not made for you! I'm getting a real man with all working parts and emotion, a caring heart, controlled ego, and generosity of spirit. Oh, and a package that doesn't look like it was run over when it fell off a truck. I've seen stuff on the butcher's block more appetizing. Suits u Cuz  u r a Bottom anyway. Have fun Tootsie and please don't tell anyone I was married to you.

-1	negative	health Confessions	There is no prince in my life but still I'm so happy
-5	negative	health Confessions	There is someone who loves you. Besides try to think about all the people who have nothing and are grateful. A computer and internet are luxury items to many who spend their days trying to survive. Think about it. friends Confessions
-12	negative	health Confessions	there is something sentimental about the way you write but why me? yes we met by moonlight that chilling new year was the rave of my life and I still long to be there as I was with you watching me forever glancing in the distance and you thought I did not know.yes we met more than once. your sentiments are most intriguing. please go onis it you my love? shall we meet once more?I await you replies by sunrise. let me clear my mind meeting you again makes me so heady and dazed. do you know how that feels? do you?
-6	negative	health Confessions	There is this girl I met at DC at a con. She's everything I want and I'm falling in love, only issue, she's 14 and I'm 20. We're also girls.
-6	negative	health Confessions	There never was any tgrsldy.because her Tiger was a figment of her imagination. Made of desperation, gullibility and deceit. I confess..it was entirely my own fault. I failed to heed the advice I give others as a matter of course.   "when someone shows you who they are, believe them" I failed to listen to my own adviceand now, I have lost all. I also have another confession. I am fine. I don't hurt.I not really even surprised. I'm really just kinda tirednoVERY tired. I have always been, and always will be Sxdup

-2	negative	health Confessions	There's a free open-source graphics program you can get legally, Gimp. Try that. 
-9	negative	health Confessions	There's always ups and downs in life. Mostly, I've been in lows. I've been pretty pessimistic lately..and other times too. Sometimes I want to give up. And end it. I try really hard to be optimistic..and yes, it's quite hard once you've been in the lows for so long. But I realize that there's still hope. Life isn't all that bad. I have to constantly remind myself that. There's alway something good in it. We just don't focus on the good things we've done or that's happened. Like how you've made someone smile, help them out, be there for them when no one was. Or how someone's made you smile and told you how pretty you are. Little things like that. I guess when you're really sad, you just don't focus on those positve memories or thoughts. It's a struggle between positive an negative thoughts. If you just believe, then maybe, just maybe good things will happen. Life's a ** and also full of miracle. They just happen to occur at the most unexpected moment.
-1	negative	health Confessions	there's more fake profiles here then I thought.
-8	negative	health Confessions	There's no right or wrong way to express yourself when writing a confession. As long as you don't harass others and bombard them trying to force them to reveal their identity to you -- all because you believe they are someone you know in real life, when they aren't. If you have problems or some of these confessions trigger delusions, don't take that out on others.
-10	negative	health Confessions	There's so much i want to say, need to say, but i'll try and keep this short. i'm not sure what exactly your take is on all this whole thing that is or should i say was, me and you. See, i truly cant pretend to even begin to understand the situation of things. idon'tknow if you feel i deserve some kind of an explanation or not. You've shown me. My feelings are hurt. They truly are. Youshouldn'thave done this. Whatever the the case maybe you should at least level with me. We're not children. it only tends to hurt even more when you say nothing. i'll spare you the dramatics of it all butthisis something i felt just needed saying.
-17	negative	health Confessions	There was a time where I didn't think I would ever let myself love again. Then, the first time I let myself love again, it hurt me almost worse. I wonder now, to myself, if there is a God, what he has in store for me? My window for having kids is closing my heart has undergone huge amounts of emotional trauma, the people around me are dying more quickly than I'd like to believe.. I'm so tired. It's like this sadistic bastard of a God is taking everything away from me. All I've ever wanted is to be a mother, a lover, a friend. I haven't got any of that. It's all slipping through my fingers. If I can't have what I want the most, what is there left for me? I may not know what chronic physical pain is, but I know what incapacitating emotional pain is. I've felt it far too often for my taste. It's like someone is lacing their fingers through my ribs and crushing my sternum.
-17	negative	health Confessions	There was no verbal commitment between us.I really don't know why I am stuck on you.Why is it that I feel your pain when there is nothing between us?Maybe It is the entanglement of our souls which is not allowing us to let go.Sometimes we have to take tough decisions.You have to pretend cruel for the betterment of those you love.I know I am taking the risk of a lifetime pain for myself.But that seems okay.I can take any amount of pain for you.I hope the high walls I am building will help you look for better options which otherwise may not be possible for you.The closing of my doors may open new doors leading you to happiness and peace. Do you think you will be truly happy with me when I don't even fit in the picture of the person you are dreaming of all these years?I don't want to hurt you. You mean the world to me.
-20	negative	health Confessions	There was this boy who used to like me since 3rd grade. At first, I didn't know he actually like me until 6th grade.That was 3 years of him having a secret crush on me. If you want to know how I know, the whole class knew it before it took me a year to understand.He was a shy boy but very sweet. He gives me bracelets for my birthdays. I lost most of them because I don't keep jewelryand I didn't know it was out of crush but I make sure to keep the last one I received. He had given me a pink teddy bear which I'm holding while typing this. It's been 2 years since we got separated.We were just getting started to be friends when I found out he had a crush on me and I noticed too that I like him, so we easily lose contact. I don't know its true but I've heard from a friend, he has moved on.And you know what's bad? I can't.

-5	negative	health Confessions	The way I feel right now and the way I have felt in the last 48 hours, I want it to end and disappear. I tried everything. There seems to only be one route left.  It won't solve anything but it will take it away the pain and the *. I'm done. friends Confessions
-7	negative	health Confessions	the white light twice. It was the most beautiful experience I have ever gone through. It was so peaceful and calm. I wonder if this is a place where people go when they depart from this universe. I was so devestated when I woke up and found myself backon planet earth. I suppose God has bigger plans for me before I reach Nirvana :0
-25	negative	health Confessions	The world around us was filled with endless violence, and there was no way that we were going to risk staying there. She told me to follow her across the world, where we could live together in peace and harmony. I agreed and made the one year journey all the way to the Pacific Ocean where she was from. On the way she met an old boyfriend from another country. They talked for hours as I waited for her on the side. The next thing I knew they started to swim ahead, and never once did she give me a second glance. There was no way for me to sway her mind, and talk her into coming back with me. It angered me that I swam all this way, just to get dumped and forgotten by an old geezer like him. I knew that I should never have listened, or believed her when she said that she loved me. That's it!  I'm going back to where I came from and I hope that they both drown in a tsunami! Look at me now! I look like I have been drenched in oil. Life's a **, and everything is always about her!

Yes,sadly it was just one-sided love and I ,ofcoursebeing the one thatadmired the other person.I oftenfantasize about my first love and just what would happen if fate allows us to meet years from now.Aftercoincidentallymeeting , he would notice thebeautifullady I hadtransformed to and howsuccessfulI've become.  And he would finally tell me what I've been dying to hear all those years, which is that he loves me as well. He wouldapologize for breaking my heart and playing attention to those other girls.And In a perfect world, he and I would finally have our happy ending.

-1	negative	health Confessions	This guy drains my money. I'm so foolish to let him do that. But the hell, why I'm so stupid when it comes to love?
-3	negative	health Confessions	This guy in my Science class, well, commented on my clothing choices.I live with my dad, and we're pretty money tight most of the time, so I don't really have much options for clothing.He said, "You own like, 1000 pairs of skinny jeans, and like, 4 shirts."And now, every time I pick out my clothing, I imagine his thoughts when he sees me wearing the same shirt I wore a week ago.I really hate school.I hate people in general.
-12	negative	health Confessions	This guy just keeps forcing himself into my life and f**g thing up. Two weeks ago I was perfectly happy with my life, things were good with my parents, my friends, my boyfriend, I had forgiven this guy for all the hurt an heartache he put me through about three months ago now an I was happy not talking to him. Them he jut had to show up and confuse me all over again because he knows how I feel about him, sadly and regretfully, I still have strong feelings. He made me second guess and I was so stupid to let myself fall for his bull s**t all over again. I essentially left my bf for him and he left his gf thing for me and yesterday, on my birthday, he told me for hours on end how much he loves and cares about me but today, out of nowhere, suddenly wants nothing to do with me again. This is what happened last time to, he sends mixed signals and I hate myself because I keep thinking he actually cares but he doesn't

-5	negative	health Confessions	this guy, who essentially gave me nothing of himself, turned me into the biggest sack ofblubbery, gushy,hormonal messiness. Never, never have I experienced this. Never. Even with the guys I dated, I would still continue my life beyond them. But this guy, I just don't know. I've seen such a poetic, beautiful, creative side of myself emerge because of my hope to be with him. Words, I never knew lived within me, flooded out of my mind. Yet, it was all a delusional trick of the mind. An impossible fate. A lie, of my own creation.
-6	negative	health Confessions	This has been going on for a while. But I'm gonna keep this concise. Basically, Imuch myself and I am aware that self mutilation is bad. Very bad. Hence, I feel the need to talk to someone about it. And I thought I'd tell my teacher. Yes, the teacher I mention in my other posts.  But the problem is, I don't know how to start; how to approach him; where to begin. Someone, anyone, please share your thoughts with me!!

However, I always am thankful to HIMfor the people I've meet in this 24 years being on this earth.

-6	negative	health Confessions	This is really weird. I wrote random things for no reason. It's like my hands have their own minds. The replies on my chat box are even more weird.

-14	negative	health Confessions	This is true i never had any girlfriend, i dont know why i never found anyone who could understand me, and those who does are not whom i wanted to be with.. I started finding people on social sites and i dont know why there are so many fake people out there, not just fake but right down nasty too. :*(I once found a girl on site, became good friend, even fell in love, despite the long distance, but she dont talk much to me now, and the reality is i have never seen her in real (on webcam etc) , so im just afraid that whether she's fake too or not. Conclusion is, i never got anyone whom i can call mine  I guess they dont like my look or what~

-18	negative	health Confessions	This morning I went to MEPS (Military Entrance Processing Station). I filled out the mountian of paper work and gave it to the Sargent who was running MEPS. He starts scaning threw it to make sure that everything was filled out. He asked "you suffer from depression and anxiety". To which I replyed "yes". Then from behind I hear some people laughing. Two or three of the other recruits were laughing at me because I have depression and anxiety. Too many people who don't suffer from these conditions just think that they are a big joke. Needless to say I was hurt, but the worst was yet to come. One of the recruits who was laughing at me passed me on his way out. He turned to me and called me a "coward". I was shocked, I can't beleive how cruel people are. As you may have thought I did not pass and now I have a permenent denial in to any military branch. People laughing at me just reminds me of school *sigh* I hate some people.

-9	negative	health Confessions	This week my therapist asked me about my reason for living. I told her that I couldn't live without my family.my friends.I was lying. I don't know why I'm alive. I told her I went for help because my anxiety drove me to harming myself in order to avoid social situations.what I didn't tell her was that I went because one night I was so down I seriously considered scrambling my innards with a kitchen knife. I'm severely lost. I just want to hide in a corner, away from humanity. I would give anything to be like anyone else. I want to be absolved of my anxiety, this illness in my skull. But I can't even be myself on this site without scratching out my alias. What am I?

-25	negative	health Confessions	Today has been such a hard day. Had a business meeting with the rest of the coworkers. There is this one guy who always makes smartass remarks towards me. If im having a bad day he usual laughs at me and asks me how could I possibly have a bad day when I dont have to do anything, because im a "pretty girl" I guess he must think pretty people dont have daily issues like everyone else. He sees me in the office and thinks that I have it made as if my world is make believe. He doesnt know that the night before my husband was slapping me around the kitchen, because I was late coming home. He doesnt know that before I left to come to work my husband choked me with a warning to never be late coming home again. I wear my blouses buttoned all the way up, so no one will see the scars and the redness against my neck. I go to work with the emotional abuse then I go home to the physical abuse. Yeahmy life is just perfect! I guess its the price I pay for being the "Pretty Girl" right?

-6	negative	health Confessions	Today I left Disney World. Every time I think about this, I cry. Leaving that place along with my new friends from the UK has sent me into a literal depression. I know there are lots of people going through things that are WAY WORSE, but I can't help it. I'm gonna go color my Duffy now.
-8	negative	health Confessions	Today I'm feeling completely unattractive and blah.It was "that time" again. The time where you have to go clothes shopping.I'm so sick of going into places, finding cute stuff that's age-appropriate for meand yet doesn't fit. I'm a size 14, 168 lbs., and 5'3''. Yeah, I'm "overweight",but that does NOT mean designers should make anything over a size 10 looklike it's strictly for ages 40+! funny Confessions
-11	negative	health Confessions	Today is the two week check in. Today we find out if all the interventions we've done in the past 2 weeks are enough to save my baby and have a somewhat "normal" birth even though this bun has 2 more months to bake. I'm scared. Not much scares me, but I am so over the top scared right now. I just had to say something. Mother's are supposed to be this godly embodiment of all things warm and fuzzy. They are supposed to be these strong unmovable pillars of grace and goodness. Well.. I'm not. I'm scared and saying it loud. I believe there is more strength in admitting you need help then pushing at it alone. So here I am in all my glory and faults. I am human. I am scared!
-12	negative	health Confessions	Today I watched the sun rise waiting hoping.. you would call. How have you been ?You are theone, dearest to my heart and you don't even know it.

-20	negative	health Confessions	Today morning I woke up really late as I was dreaming about you. Even after I woke up, I kept trying to go back to my dreams. Even though I think of you once in a while, it was never like today. I cried after I finally woke up. I wanted to sit down and write a mail to you to see how you're doing. I thought, for once, I'll set aside my ego and try to be the better man. I'll apologize for everything I said and not ask you to apologize in return. I wanted to say that I understand and I just want you back. But then again I started to rationalize and felt what if it was only my delusion. What if you guys again start making fun of my psychological disorders? What if I was always just a joke to you? What if you never thought of me in the way I thought of you? 4 years is a long time and I'm not sure if I've just made up my memories the way I wanted to remember you. I really don't know what's true.
-6	negative	health Confessions	Today was a good day. A happy day. A day where I could walk around on my own without the worry of going to uni, without going to anything in particular, no dates, no meetings, no lectures..nothing. Just a nice day to relaxwait? What's this? I ran into my ex and my ex best friend? You mean the best friend that cheating with my ex and my ex decided to leave me, she wouldn't take him but then later decided to and her explanation was " You can't do anything about it because he has a hold on my heart that I can't let go.." His, the same reason. REHEARSED MUCH??Hope I don't see you two again or I'll clock you.
-8	negative	health Confessions	Today was decision day with Meg and I. After many face to face talks, tears, calls, and nights laying together not knowing if it would be the last time I am still in PA with her. She chose meI want to celebrate. Run around outside like a maniac. But I'm cautious. Change of heart or mindOR the fact that now I have to show and prove. Not that I can't or won't, just got to walk the walk. But for right now, in this moment, I am okay, and she chose me. I hope to not have to "confess" to the contrary any time soon.

-8	negative	health Confessions	TO HIM: I honestly don't know what to do. I have failed you as a friend. I feel like I am the worst friend EVER. i am a selfish person and I only thought of how I was feeling. I was wrong so many ways. I lashed out at you because I have never had someone like you or this situation happen before in my life. I didn't know how to handle myself. I felt uncomfortable in my skin (in a good way) and I didn't know what to do 'this' ( you and me.)  I'm doing ok. (Really, I'm not. I just tell myself that I am, hoping to convince myself I'm ok, hoping to become ok.) Today could be (so much) better (if you had called me and wanted to go do something tomorrow or the next day or the NEXT, or just to say 'hello'.) I don't miss you. (I'm a really bad liar, too.)  Has the question ever crossed you mind: Can we start over? I love you. I honestly love you.That is probably the reason why I can't forget you. FROM: HER
-2	negative	health Confessions	to him "I LOVE YOU!" But I don't think he feels the same. I wish I knew what he wanted from me. I want him here with me all the time but it isn't like that we don't talk anymore but maybe one a week. And at that it is very brief almost. I hate the path he chose to take. I hate myself for being so weak. I need him and want him and love him so much.

-3	negative	health Confessions	Took out life insurance on my son, right after he started dating her. I put a stop to that. She is nothing, but a user.
-1	negative	health Confessions	To pretend I was your soulmate. To subject me to cruel games. To ignore my input, ideas, and feelings. To allow abuse of my kids. To make me the unwelcome  outcast at your family  gatherings. To bankrupt me. To finally announce you are gay after years of smelling excrement during relations with your toys. You are a hellbound deviant HOG.
-14	negative	health Confessions	To tell the truth, I'm tired of where I am currently living. Due to our financial situation, My wife and our 2 babies have had to move in with her parents. We've been here just over 5 months and it's really starting to get unbearable. I'd explain all the reasons why, but that could take hours. I feel like we're not making any progress with our financial situation because both of her parents are gambling addicts and they always want to borrow money, or have us get loans for them, which is a big part of why we are where we are in the first place. They have gambled their money away several times and are currently behind on most of their bills, so they keep coming to us for help, saying we owe it to them for letting us stay here. I feel like it's a never ending vicious cycle and we are never going to escape. I have to get out of here. It's beginning to drive us apart and I don't know where to begin to fix the situation.
-4	negative	health Confessions	To the person that broke my heart I don't even know where to start. It's been a whole year and yet the scars still appear. Oh baby it's been a while. Will I ever see you smile? Will I ever hear you say, Hello sweet, you had a good day? Baby, what are you thinking C'mon stop my heart from sinking. Just tell me how you feel. That's right, you know it's all real. You make my body burn like fire. Is this really what you desire? My eyes pour like rain, please get me out of this pain. Tell me what I can do. But baby, it won't stop me loving you
-3	negative	health Confessions	To the person who said, "overall enthusiasm, YEEHAW!" this made my day, especially because I'm wearing overalls.
-16	negative	health Confessions	To truly know if someone loves you is when they hang on so tight even when they know they have no chance in hell of being with you. Like holding water with an open hand we all know the result but why continue to spend your time thinking about them? Hoping they are ok, wondering what they are doing, wishing to see them happy and if they aren't.. wanting to make them happy. It is too difficult to describe what a broken heart feels like, it does the experience no justice. What I know is that we need to be careful who we decide to give it to because reality is, how many times do you think it's possible to mend a broken heart before it becomes too ugly for someone else to love?
-3	negative	health Confessions	To you is real, as remembering a girl i use to love and crushed at high school even thought I had not much chance.. So i love you again as a reminder

-3	negative	health Confessions	Trust if I ever see that face You will get more than you bargained for. Cross my heart Needle in you
-6	negative	health Confessions	Trust is everything in a relationship. Without it your whole world can fall apart. Hearts collide continuously and as they do, they search for the one thing that matters most. With it young seeds begin to sprout, beautiful colors of red, yellow, and blue filling the universe with a plethora of beauty, happiness, and unending inspiration. Always remember to be open and honest. Never leave her guessing or wondering about anything. Look deep into her eyes whenever you speak. Let her know that your words are true. Leave no room in her heart for questions or doubts. Instead fill it with unending love and devotion. Be there for her in every way and always remember to move her heart and soul like she's never felt before.
-6	negative	health Confessions	Truth be told I will never be perfect, but you say no one is righteous not one, not one seeks God and I take comfort in that for I have altoghther become aworldly Christian, living solely off of your grace and doing whatever I please, though I was not physically doing anything wrong my heart was in all the wrong places again, and now I give it back to you and my faith is restored. I will live in love and by faith for you my love and all that you ask me to do.

I will be coming home soon for a short while and hope very much to see you and my daughter.. I'm trying very hard to be healthy so that I can be a positive influence in my babies lives and that I can help for them to grow up happy and healthy.. I hope you are happy and healthy too.. I'm not really smart enough to figure out any other way to reach you other than here or Rachel, and she's not giving out any numbers I think of you every day and hope to one day be the type of person you and Sarah can be proud of..

It's not because I would be embarrassed or anything. It's because I literally can't do it. I don't know why but it's seriously going to become an issue since I'm going to college soon.

-12	negative	health Confessions	Ungrateful  children need to be dealt with from early on. It's not a "phase" it's bratty children that grow into horrible, wasteful adults. Parenting is NOT for everyone. Anyone can be a parent, only some can be exceptional parents. My friend has obnoxious children, spoiled and unruly with no manners or respect for adults. Her kids make a scene in public but it's always the fault of the public. Denial is a large word in her life, her oldest is just an embarrassment with zero social skills. The problem is today people ignore the important signs of children's bad behaviour and let it ride. Yes, today's society has too many self centered people playing the role of parents.  U see too many nannies bringing up the children especially the ones that are desperately seeking guidance of a parent.  Nothing wrong with getting help if you need some time to work but so many people claim they can't "handle" raising a child! Hello, perhaps you shouldn't have had children!! friends Confessions
-1	negative	health Confessions	up after last nightnow they're down again. Should never be to hopeful.
-14	negative	health Confessions	Up until 1 month ago I have been depressed for the longest time and taking meds, recently divorced and laid off. I could never pin point why I have been like this. I moved out to the desert to mentally detox. I have always felt that I have failed at everything in life. It wasn't until it hit me in the head. I have always followed others dreams and set up goals that I did not like. I never knew what made me happy and never really following what I wanted. I have always been told to work at a job with lots of money. In reality I just want a job that is fun and changes everyday dont care about money. Money is one of the reason why this world and economy is going down the drain. Feeling happy is now worth more than being full of money, cause when there is a will there is a way.
-3	negative	health Confessions	Ure really not looking for me around. There are a lot of attractivier men around to find. Dont use a replacement boy for ur loneliness needs

-3	negative	health Confessions	was that i could not   someone that genuinely loved me.
-4	negative	health Confessions	we could move past this,even if it is just a small baby step like a smile and hello. If you do want to see and talk to me, I could use encouragement from you, no matter how tiny that may be. Otherwise, I promise Iwill keep my distance, and assume that I am respecting your feelings in doing so.
-2	negative	health Confessions	We deserve better lives and you know it.
-3	negative	health Confessions	We don't own a house and we are so behind on rent. I'm scared my hubby is failing me
-14	negative	health Confessions	We had a relationship that could never go anywhere but it was wonderful while it lasted. Things went terribly wrong and now it seems we can never go back to the way things were and it breaks my heart. I loved our talks and the fun we had.  I loved being myself no matter how silly it was and I loved the way I felt when I was with you. Now, it's gone and it's cold and it hurts but how do I make it stop?  How do I turn off my feelings and move on?  How can I manage to see you and not get that sick feeling in the pit of my stomach because so much has changed? I will always cherish what we had and maybe someday, we will have that relationship again but I see that for now it will not happen. I will try to stuff my feelings away and try to move on and try to act as if nothing is bothering me. Thats all I can do.
-13	negative	health Confessions	we had a rogue patron who would pick their nose and deposit the contents in the book they were reading. Multiple times. She must have had some severe sinus condition given the quantity. She'd slimed dozens by the time we caught her (had to first go through every single fracking book to pull the ones already slimed so she couldn't claim it came like that (everybody working had to help, and it was gross), and check every single book being returned). Sent the police to have a little chat with her and charged her for all of the ruined books. I doubt she paid, but she stopped coming in, so we won.
-2	negative	health Confessions	We have 4 children together the last one resulted from an affair. No I'm not proud but it happened. Sad thing is im not proud of my behavior and figured surely my husband would want to leave me NOPE!! Im so unhappy but I can't leave because  the children  he won't let me.. BOOOO
-4	negative	health Confessions	We have sleepovers.  And it's wrong.  I have the thoughts The urges In contrast Yours are always so innocent.  It makes me feel like monster One who would cry a million "sorry's" if you ever found out.  For once I want you to be the 'wrong' one.  To tear this facade apart And take command So we can fool around in our tent Of sheets.
-3	negative	health Confessions	Well go duke each other!!!!! I left a condo for you on my desk I'm going shopping
-13	negative	health Confessions	Well I confided in a guy that I like him. But I like his personality. He's bland looking. I have a problem though. I tend to stop liking a guy when I go out with him. I don't know why but it always happens. I'm also nervous because I am waiting till marriage to lose my virginity. I already know that I will never marry this guy. I mean he's not my marriage type. He's the "date him for a bit" type. I always end up hating the person I'm with. I don't know what's wrong with me. I know that we'll probably be together all throughout high school because I don't want to make it weird at the lunch table. I already gave a sick feeling in my tummy. I just know that one day I will hurt him. The only time I'll stay with someone for a long time is when I'm head over heels in love. And I know I won't be with this guy. In a way I'm playing with his heart.
-2	negative	health Confessions	Well I have always had a horrible life and have no car, or a house, money, or a cute partner, I'm pretty but I don't feel that pretty, don't have friends, can't travel because circumstances and money, and my family don't want to know anything about me and my parents want to support or talk to me, and don't have any happiness.I feel so jealous of my cousin because she has everything that I don't have shes beautiful, she has a cute partner, she has money, has a car, a big house by the beach, has a lot friends, and travels a lot. That's why I feel so jealous of her and she has a good life and parents that love her and shes really happy and I'm not.
-11	negative	health Confessions	Well I have been seeing my new girlfriend about every other day. Have even introduced her to my wife. So far my wife only thinks we are friends? The 3 of us have gone to Bible study once & Sunday evening we went to a contata at church. We had made a tentative date for yesterday (Monday) to have Intimate relations & she kept her promise. Wahoo! Beings I am so much older than she we made a agreement that if she found a younger mam I would let her go. Yesterday She said she might even have a replacement for  me? Happy Bill friends Confessions
-9	negative	health Confessions	well, I haven't cut in a few weeks. But, I have had many urges. Its not bullying or anything, its stress. When I stress over the littlest thing, I urge. Another thing is boys. I like this guy. We dated, and I listened to this girl to break up with him, and I did. I ruined everything. Im not sure if he likes me still, doubt it:/ but, I just kinda want someone to talk to. I need advice please.

He has been treating me like crap, but I have no where to go, no car, am going through a lot of medical problems, and am going back to my college classes Tues. I am flat broke, and scared to death. I am beginning to not believe in love. I will miss the guy I fell in love with, and hoped he would change back inot that man. I don't know where to begin, where to move. I refuse to stop school or get rid of my critters. I really feel screwed over. friends Confessions
-6	negative	health Confessions	Well where to startI was recently in a less than desirable job. I came across a guy I knew in college by chance. I'm running into some financial trouble. He's willing to foot the bill and possibly have me move in if need be. We've discussed having a relationship and are willing to give it a shot because we really like each other and want the same things. Main thing being a family.Problem is I've been alone for so long and am used to doing things on my own. I don't know how to accept help and I feel it's going to ruin the relationship. I can't stop feeling guilty, or as if I'm a burden.If you can help or suggest any advice please feel free to comment. friends Confessions
-7	negative	health Confessions	We pantsed two boys in the school's pool and never got into trouble. It was so embarrassing they never said a word about it. They both got bullied by older boys to embarrass them when girls were around. They totaly got caught off guard and sudently ended buck naked with their suits down by their feet. They must have felt so humiliated to know that half the girls in school saw their little pipi's in broad day light.
-5	negative	health Confessions	We put up a good fight. I am just sorry it didn't work. But at least we know we gave it all we had. I will always care about you. And I will forever Love you.Im Single *.
-18	negative	health Confessions	We spend so much time trying to understand life in these formalistic terms, black or white, on/off.We have so much trouble embracing the uncertainty that life brings, the grey, the analog.In realitythe grey is what frees us, the grey is what allows us to dance, to hope, to live, to love, to have faith.I am standing here in the grey where you left me. Meet me here. It's time for us to dance. Our song never stopped, I should know. I waited here the entire time.Come back baby. It is never going to black and white, nothing in life is black and white. We can live the grey. That is where love resides.

-4	negative	health Confessions	We've all got someone, that one special person who we never stop thinking about. The one we miss when theyre gone. The one that makes us feel on top of the world. Its lying in bed at night and falling asleep with their face pictured in your mind, imagining them there with you cuddling you whilst you sleep. Its not just love, its a bond between the two of you.Its neverwanting to let that person go, so you just keep on holding them, hugging them, feeling their embrace. When your so close, dreading the time when you have to part. Thats when you know, that theyrethe one for you, and theres noone else.. confession of the heart<3
-8	negative	health Confessions	We've been seeing each other over 4 yrs. I've been sick all weekend, so didn't wanna hang out. I text'd and asked to borrow $20 this morning to see the doc and get my scripts filled. Had to accompany my mom to immigration afterwards to pick up some paperwork. I've had the flu so I was exhausted and run down feeling after all this. All the while he's calling and texting away. I finally let him know I'm not feeling well and just wanna run out with my mom, grab some food and get back in bed. We walk out of my place and there he is his just sitting in my parking lot! Just out of view of my windows. This really makes me angry and creeps me out! What can you do, or how do you handle someone like this? It feels really intrusive and violating! I'd say this is a huge red flag!

-4	negative	health Confessions	What if I found something, a secret he has been hiding from me, what if she is what keeps him up late at night and its not his * like he says it is? Are they talking or is it a silent attraction, does he just preruse her photos? I hear her name said to me alot, am I over reacting? If so why would you create a false account for your silent endevour? Why is it you can talk about others who work there in less detail until it comes to her. You said her name incorrect it's.., why are you jumping down my throat about stuffing up her name. Do you like this women? I need to talk to someone any one I am silently crying, screaming, fuming inside. Let me go, I dont want to be here if it is all true let me go let me be with that Man who wont hurt me like this ever. funny Confessions

-6	negative	health Confessions	What is up with all of these children masquerading as adults in their twenties on this site. Your maturity level shows. Being a smarta ss only makes you look like a child. Remember the grade school humor? No different here. Do you really think anyone is impressed with this? Why not post your real age? Why not go to Group Hug where you really belong. That site is full of children

-9	negative	health Confessions	What's the point now? Seems like you got me all figured out..just make sure you kill me some more. Truth hurts and I've come to realize what I have done. I'm my worst critic so bash me, I'll take it. Hate me, I'll accept that. I'll throw it in the gutter later because I have no more room for harsh words or hate. You are so right. I'm finished living wrong and thank you for your support.
-3	negative	health Confessions	What the heck is so wrong with me? Im nothing.  ButI see people do double takez and take long looks when Im out. Doesnt mean a thing to me. I just want you to do that.
-8	negative	health Confessions	What the hell, one day all   and then toxic members attacking each other. Please and thank you stop. This is ridiculous. I was at least expecting them to be teens but surprisingly theyre not  You should all just go and send each other pm about how you hate each other. No one needs to hear the yap yap here. I hate when members have to leave because of the insults of others. If you dont like what a member has to say, or their group of friends, or you are jealous because they all offer support and admiration, appreciation and hugs to each other DONT READ THEM. That simple. Block them. Simple. Dont comment on their stories, they won't care what you have to say anyways.  I have a better idea. Make your own website and post what you wish and if you disagree you can just delete them.  Finally, I needed to say this, it was driving me crazy Please make this place drama free, enough with the real world.
-2	negative	health Confessions	What would you be offering????? more pain perhaps???? Yeah it's that day funny Confessions
-4	negative	health Confessions	What you said warrants an important corrective You NEVER left me. Every day you are writing to me on here. Every day I can see you posting comments to someone who does not exist. Don't you think it's abput time to call a halt to that masquerade?
-11	negative	health Confessions	when a girl is confessing about how hurt she is because of the abuse she has had to live with and he comment i'm sorry and i understand, please, you couldn't possibly understand, you just see a victim you can prey on. he fails to remember that somevictims are not even victims at all they are survivors and some survivors become apex preditors to feed on the like of you d.r.w.. the only thing he understands is how to abuse a victim.and that's it for today tah tah until next time
-16	negative	health Confessions	When are you Anons (people with no nicknames on here that is and confess totally anonymously) gonna realize that people will mess with people? ESPECIALLY online AND on confessions. Unless someone flat out says something that you KNOW or flat out says their NAME, then more than likely its not for you OR about you. There are 6 billion people in the world. I mean, come on! There is a 99.9% chance that none of these confessions are about YOU. And if you are definitely corresponding on here with each other, go somewhere else and do it. This is NOT a message board. And if you are trying to be all secretive, GROW UP. Be honest with the person you are trying to hide from, so they can go on with their life. It's really stupid to try and "hide" cause that person could easily do it back to you, and I bet they have.
-1	negative	health Confessions	When do you intend to tell Jewlia about your appetite for young boys?
-5	negative	health Confessions	whenever i fall for someone, it usually ends badly and i recently fell for someone. i just have this sense that it's going to end in the same way all of my other crushes have ended. this is torturous. seriously. it feels like this endless cycle i'm in romantically. when will i learn?
-3	negative	health Confessions	Whenever i go to my Grandmothers house, I miss that feeling of my Grandfather. I miss the way he used to come running and ask me, "What do you want to eat, what can i do for you?" He loved me so much. And the worst part is, after his death, I realised how much i loved him. I do still live happily now but without him, my life seems a bit incomplete. I had two birthday parties without him, but it didn't seem full without his being there. He is one of the best people i have ever been with in my life. Granddad, i miss you a lot.
-5	negative	health Confessions	Whenever i say that I want a puppy it is my way of saying that I'm lonely and I want a hug. No one has figured that out yet
-17	negative	health Confessions	Whenever there is some event going on in the world large enough to wake those normally from sleepwalking thru life (such as this election & the hurricane) I get in the biggest funk.  No amount of funny movies or coffee or uplifting conversation with friends seems to help.   My poor body is simply fighting all the energies and it takes all I have to just get thru the day.  So if anyone else out there is feeling like there mojo has been lost, it is only temporary I hope.  I have learned that the best thing to do is stop listening to anything going on (such as the idiot box) and busy myself doing things that bring me joy.    Many people are feeling out of sorts and I hope this helps to know you are not alone.  Smile, even if you don't feel like it, that is in all seriousness is the best medicine.  Bless you all, you'll get that mojo back soon!!! friends Confessions
-6	negative	health Confessions	Whenever you're lonely, my  , pull your shades and stare straight up into the ever-expanding night sky above you. The moon in your sky is the same as mine. Six thousand miles is nothing, because even on a moonless, black night, I'm in your stars, kissing you through constellations. Every point of light above you is another spot on your skin where my lips are having dreams of just barely brushing up against you. Not a single sea or expanding horizon can separate my love from you. It will always be in the stars, with every ounce of love I have sprinkled across the sky, wherever you look up to find it.
-13	negative	health Confessions	When he's holding me I feel protected When he kisses my forehead before walking out the door my heart pounds a little harder When he rubs my tummy with our unborn inside I get chills down my spine when he talks of our future my heart melts When he says I love you I fall head over heels in love again. I hope he realizes that how special he is to me and my two year old daughter especially after a year Who is hemy boyfriend
-13	negative	health Confessions	When I first met you I had you pegged as a snob. As I've come to know you though I find you are so very genuine and sincere in the things you say and do. Everytime you show your compassion and your true self I fall deeper in love with you. Not that it matters because I can't even tell you. Rules forbid us to be anything more than what we are. I will love you from here it's safer that way anyhow.
-5	negative	health Confessions	When I knocked over that box of pens earlier, you came straight over to help me. As you were when that heavy board nearly fell on me a while ago.I barely know you but your smiles and simple acts of kindness keep me goingand you don't even know it. You inspire me to be brave and strong and although I can't tell you to your face, you inspire me and I think I am falling for you.
-5	negative	health Confessions	When I log on here and it says "Welcome Home", my heart both rises and sinks. My heart rises because I feel like I really am home and among family, but sinks as I realize I have no idea what a home or even family would feel like
-17	negative	health Confessions	When I said I wasn't pregnant and I told you that I have my results, I was pregnant by you and I lost the baby..I am sorry I never told you also I knew you didn't want to have more kids and that's why I kept it as a secret.. Now you know why I desappeared I was scared only one person knew I was pregnantmy best friend.. My heart broke since the day I lost our baby. I was so depressed I couldn't eat, didn't want to go nowhere I lost weight and cried almost every night..That's the reason I became so cold and distant from you. I loved our baby from the first day I found out I was pregnant. I'm sorry I didn't tell you and probably you will never know.. You probably have no idea who I am if you read this confession. Sad but it's better for you not to know.
-4	negative	health Confessions	When I saw you , I knew you were da 1. I knew we would be gud together. So I went to talk 2 you. I didn't know what to say.
-7	negative	health Confessions	When I see the homeless on the street corner or sleeping on the sidewalk I just cannot find it in me to care. There are too many people in this world and so many are selfish manipulators. I suppose I'm one too, but i dont see whats wrong with that. If there were less people, we'd all be better off. My girlfriend's really into talking about compassion but shes a lazy good for nothing ** and therefore a hypocrite.  Animals are a different story. Id kill to save an animal but not for a person.

-13	negative	health Confessions	When it is quiet at night. no other sound but the thoughts in my mind I start hearing voices. They are in my head and I know they are but they just get louder and louder until it feels like my thoughts are screaming at me That's when the panic sets in. Is there something wrong with me? Do other people have this problem? Am I just crazy, because this makes me feel like I am. No one around me understands it either. I can't talk about it with anyone because they will all think I'm crazy. I wish I could connect with someone about this. My fianc doesn't even understand.
-19	negative	health Confessions	When I was a junior in high school, I cheated on what would be my first serious boyfriend with my ex/male best friend. We were both in the play Dr. Faustus. He was the Pope and I was a devil dancer in the scene where Faustus sells his soul to the devil. We were waiting backstage for curtain call and I was pissed because some of the other dancers were being bitchy. He saw I was upset and offered a hug and I ended up cuddling on his lap. Before we knew it we were making out! I don't think anyone saw us though thank God! We had a string of steamy moments during musical later that school year. Once I fell asleep on his shoulder and he kissed my forehead. The guy I was going out with knew about the musical incidents, but not about the play incident. He wasn't pissed because I made it sound like my ex was coming on to me. I went out with this guy for two years and my ex ended up dating a good friend of mine for a while.
-15	negative	health Confessions	When I was in first grade I liked/loved this boy, and i think I still do. Problem is I moved to a different state. We talked a lot. The last thing i remember about him is when he told my friend that he likes me. I told her to say to him that I didn't like him back. I feel so stupid. I was in first grade and I let my brain take over instead of my heart. Now a then this memory keeps playing inside my head and i cant get it out. Now i keep thinking about it 24/7 and it driving me crazy!! I dont think he even knows that i exist anymore. I think its been 5 years.  Plz. Someone. Give. Me. Advice.
-19	negative	health Confessions	when i was serving in the navy in the early 1980s, my ship went to Subic bay , P.I. One night, while I was walking back towards base from Marilyn's bar, a Filipino man came out of an alley toward me. he said something in Tagalog, then switched to English. "You come! You come! Sailor hurt! Sailor hurt!" and he pulled me toward the alley. I ran down there, looking for an injured sailor. the alley was a dead end, and the Filipino was behind me with a butterfly knife. he slashed me across my shoulder, which made me freak out. I hit him on the neck with my forearm, throwing my full weight into the blow. i felt his neck break. i left the scene, and returned to the ship. i never told the truth about the cut on my shoulder or the scar it left, because i was afraid Filipino authorities would come after me if they knew i killed a man on their soil.

-17	negative	health Confessions	When someone plays with your heart, it really hurts. I have tried my best to show you my heart, apparently it isn't enough. What hurts really really the most is this, I have people a lot who say you are just stunning and beautiful and you have never said that.  I had a someone I met at a dinner party and she just kept saying has any every told you how absolutely stunning and beautiful you are, I have met a lot of women in my life due to her work, she said you really just stunning and such a tender hearted person, how rare is that?  Apparently not stunning and beautiful and tender enough for you.

Maybe you would have stayed around

-4	negative	health Confessions	While at my gramma's house for thanksgiving, I had a lengthy talk with my dad and uncle. They kept asking me about what I'm planning on doing once my 1st college semester is up. To be honest a big part of me doesn't want to sign up for spring classes. Then got on about talking about how there are jobs in the medical field, but I have very little desire to help peopleI really want to learn languages and translate, I love the way some sound or are written-my want of seeing and learning about other places is a borderline unhealthy obsessionBut for some reason even though I want to do it so much, I feel so embarrassed to tell people it's what I want to do I'm not really sure why; I get really nervous when i try to talk to anyone about it. So naturally I sat there and took the suggesting medical training talk beating repressing my thoughts once again

I fell off a ladder a few years ago and refuse to step on that last rung.   You tall people are so lucky.   On a lighter note, earlier today I absentmindedly threw a towel on the floor in the exact spot I just spilled an entire 1/2 qt of paint.    A day in the life of a lucky elf.

-4	negative	health Confessions	why is it after someone dies you still hope they will come back?can't accept you will never see them again
-5	negative	health Confessions	Why is it bothering me so much to be cutoff from a non-existant relationship? Its like I claim that if he told me why? Truth is we could never be together, even if we could. I would most certainly suffer the same consequences in which I indulged. my behavior is unacceptable and without a meaningful explanation. what I have in my life is a solid and true mate, who is there to rub my back no matter the time nor place, works hard so I dont have too, listens to my desires and believes in my dreams. I have to refocus on the fact & let go of the fiction.
-7	negative	health Confessions	Why is it that everyone I know is in a relationship, or their life is consummed with finding the ONE- what if there is no ONE, what if it is ok to be alone!! Is life really supposed to be about being in love? friends Confessions
-8	negative	health Confessions	Why is it that I'm not satisfied with my relationship?! He's a sweet guy who cares for me in a profound way, yet when we're away from one another I find myself conjuring ways that I could tell him we're through. Could it be that my attraction for a male with an ethnicity different from my own is driving this feeling of being unsatisfied?! I'm so frustrated!

I am glad to see that I helped you in a time of GREAT need tho. but that is me and I am a nice person.
-18	negative	health Confessions	With the idea of leaving I never thought I'd get so close.To love you so much and to want you even more. The pain or thought of you not being here with me kills me. The time has come for me to tell you that my life would be nothing without you. All these days, all these nights only one thought on my mind and it's of you. To be with me forever. To love me like you have never loved before. Never have I seen one prettier or a nicer girl. I loved you since I clapped my eyes on you. I want to take you wherever I go. I want you to be there at my worst and best times to comfort me when I'm sad, to enjoy me when I'm happy so I can care for you just like you do with me. I'll be there whenever you need me. I'll love you no matter what. I'll protect you all the time. I'd even take a bullet for you. I hope this love lasts because I've never felt better. I wish that you would be happy with me because I'm always happy with you.

What do you make of this? Plus she is always wanting to meet my mother. friends Confessions
-1	negative	health Confessions	Wow, he hates that song!! I don't, but it makes me cry.
-3	negative	health Confessions	wow this is new for me. i don't wanna sound all angsty.  i don't even know how to begin. Basically, i miss my husband and best friend, he seems to have abandoned himself in the flow of the daily mundane. I didn't even realize this till a few hours ago when it hit me that a popular musician i've been fawning over resembles my husband, and seems to have all the passion that he used to have. i was attracted to that musician because he was a symbol of what my mate had lost, and in infatuating myself with said musician had immersed myself in an ocean of things i want for my husband but can never provide. does this sound crazy?
-1	negative	health Confessions	W R Y?  whY not write your initials too here?
-2	negative	health Confessions	Yah, umm, I think that makes you bi, not lesbian, just saying.
-2	negative	health Confessions	yeah, i did. i beat the crap out of every one of them.
-2	negative	health Confessions	Yeah I hada bad experience once. I thought I was being attacked by a succubus and realized it was actually my mother in law.
-3	negative	health Confessions	Yeah I know its probably going to look irrational and unfair but I'm hurt that you wouldn't ask me to spend time with you for the holidays. We've been dating months, I've met your family, we're exclusive and you tell me you love me. So why wouldn't you ask me to spend time with you on christmas, or at least make some time for us on new years? I feel like you're telling me you're not serious about me. And frankly of that's the case then your lead up to all this was rather unfair. Because I am very seriously in love with you, and I'd never treat you like that or make you feel unimportant to me. friends Confessions
-11	negative	health Confessions	Yeah, it's a period  . I went through 13 years of having my period without any of that PMS crap, and boy has it caught up with me. I always thought girls were just whining to get attention and pity. Now I'm laying in bed with my lower back pressed against my sleeping boyfriend's butt because it's warmth is soothing and the idea of getting up to find something else to help makes me want to weep. So yeah, screw Mother Nature. friends Confessions

This guy who I email every single day, sometimes a few times a day.  This guy who I've known since I was 16.  This guy who I slept with 3 weeks ago.  He was walking towards me with his girlfriend.  We briefly made eye contact and then looked away and kept on walking.

-7	negative	health Confessions	You are a cruel person. you never tried to build me up, ever, not one day in your life. you always gave me the stick and never the carrot. you're a sorry excuse for a parent. i almost wanna never achieve anything, because your negligence wouldnt deserve the respect of raising me. i dont know why i was never good enough for your cynical eyes. why you were so hesitant to encourage me. why i had to lick my own wounds. why you never admitted to seeing anything when others did. i cant stand you, you've done me wrong all this time.

-2	negative	health Confessions	you came here to look, I was thinking of you too! friends Confessions
-3	negative	health Confessions	You "can't get over yourself to just tell how you feel point blank". Why do I get the feeling you are full of BS and have no intention to compromise anytime for anyone?  My instincts and experience tell me your "love" is smart to not wait for a person who stubbornly sits and does nothing and gives up nothing - and then whines to everyone it was the other oneof course. I'd bet money the "launchee" has already invested too much in you and knows you're far too selfish to take your turn at sacrifice and change. Just sit there, something will fall into your lap someday and you can pretend to "love" that one, too.
-7	negative	health Confessions	you can treat me so well.. and you can treat me so bad you can break me down so hard that I can't get out of bed in the morning you make me cry.. you make me unhappy you are immune to my tears I can scream and scream but you don't hear me any more you don't respect my opinions .. and you don't respect my feelings I can't reach your heart  I take me for granted all wanted for years was you All I wanted in my life was you.. but you have left me broken and crying.. you used to hold me so close at night .. you kissed me slowly while I woke up in your arms I stroked my fingers through your dark curls. we were so happy were did it go wrong why can't we go back to the beginning why do I still love you.. even though I can hardly see your face though the tears in my eyes
-1	negative	health Confessions	You chose this. Do I still   you Yep. Am I settling Probably. But you left me so you chose this. You cant keep doing this to me I have to move on. You chose this I don't feel guilty. I'm sorry tho cause I still love you soooooo much. Nothing has ever hurt this much. It's ok though.
-10	negative	health Confessions	You claim you don't want to hurt me, and don't want to get hurt, after three years of this. After all the passion, hate, anger, love, I don't know how we can simply be friends. I don't think that you realize waking up next to you hurts more then anything, the way you look at me makes me turn away, I'm terrified of my best friend because I know what you could do to me, what you have already done. I'm sorry for hurting you, I'm sorry for everything I ever did to ruin whatever pathetic rubble we kept trying to build into something a little stronger. I'll never be strong enough to rid my life of you, I'll always be here, and above all else, that hurts the most. friends Confessions
-1	negative	health Confessions	You could be a good mom, you could start now and give your baby up for an open adoption. That way you can give your baby life and love, keep yourself from the side effects of abortion, stay in touch with him or her and be a part of their life and grandchildren someday. A win win for all.
-4	negative	health Confessions	You deserve to be thrown acid to ur face. All ur easy life has nothin to do but show u how a disgrace to justice u are. Then only ull learn to be a good person and respect others
-1	negative	health Confessions	you don't hurt anyone and get screwed over? And the people who do the hurting win in the end? Yeah, I thought so.
-2	negative	health Confessions	You don't know anyone writing here anonymously. If you think your replies are reaching someone you know in real life, you must be mentally retarded.
-1	negative	health Confessions	You dykes are stupid. What's a lesbian anyway. You still need your * poked, might as well be with a man. And no, I'm not jealous or your ungod like behaviors.
-9	negative	health Confessions	You enchanted me. Our eyes met I felt spellbound. As the day went on the connection grew. Laughs were shared, hugs and kisses given. Then at end of the night there was a bond, one of friendship, one of closeness. As days went on, the connection and closeness grew. Now after all this time there is only one thing I can say. All my heart I know. I love you.
-1	negative	health Confessions	You fight for   but you want them to reach out to you? How's that fighting for love when you want them to do all of the work?
-8	negative	health Confessions	You got me. I   you and I always will.  I fall for your blue eyes everytime. You never fail to hurt me,  but I fall for your empty promises everytime. You come to me everytime and tell me how much you love me how much you care and leave me even more broken then before. I want you to love me, but I understand if I were you I couldn't love someone like me either. I miss you, I'm tempted to text you everyday, but the fear of future pain stops me. You only contact me to let me know you've moved on. I wish you'd just fall back. Disappear I want to move on with my life.
-6	negative	health Confessions	You have 2 lives. Your first life ends when you realize you only have one life.I stumbled upon this after my grandfather passed very suddenly. Ever since, Ive been trying to live each day as if it were my last.
-1	negative	health Confessions	You have no ideal I bet game over.. I. Totally. Don't like liars or people. Who pretend. Play games well.
-8	negative	health Confessions	You have to admit, it was quotes feat to still be a thought after all this time without ever meeting and not talking to me in many years. There gave been twenty guys who stared in your eyes , laying in bed beside you , who you shared a bliss that was certain for eternity that you don 'g even remember the names of. I was Ju Sum Gai. But I live in mind . I am eternal and immortal. I am nothing at all. You got to admire that. Good luck, you little nut.

-17	negative	health Confessions	You hide from me. And I love you. I adore you. But, everything is on your terms. How can you say you love me when you don't call me or contact me? That's all I want. I want to know you care. I live for your words. I messed up. I made a host of mistakes and I can't do it over. But you know me. I want you to know that I know why you hurt. You don't believe in yourself like I do. You're incredible!!! My feelings don't get hurt, really, because I see why you are lashing out. You have flaws and I still love you every second. I never stopped. Initially, I feel like I've been clawed and the pain stays with me, but know that I see past it, and I love that you shared it all with me. I do love you unconditionally.
-3	negative	health Confessions	You hurt me more then you know. And I miss you like hell. I want to hate you so I can move more quickly but I can't. Idk if I can be your friends cuz I won't be be able to handle seein you with other girls. I told you why I don't do relationships. I told you why I was scared to begin with and you pushed for it and now you leave me like this. friends Confessions

-1	negative	health Confessions	You know how I was always concerned about him, always asking about him.
-3	negative	health Confessions	You know I have never been on a real proper date ever. I am 35 years old and have never really been asked by a guy to take me on a real date. I have had so called relationships and went out for pizza or something but an actual date where maybe justing kissing was possible at the end of the night. Ive never been married hmmm maybe this is why because a real man will wait for you and respect you.
-4	negative	health Confessions	you know whats funny most of us cant see beyond are own thoughts take one minute to think what another might feel or think it might surprise you
-21	negative	health Confessions	You know what sucks, when you find a great guy they always are unavailable. The guy i am in love with lives pretty far away and i can't stand it. We see eachother a couple times every couple of months. I just hate the fact that when i see him he act like he really likes me but when we talk on the internet or anything he just seems like a friend. He's a friend of the family so i see him quite alot so its very hard to move on. He's told me how much he's love me and i dont know if he meant it or was just saying it. I always ask him to be upfront about everything with me but he never does anything, He just diverts the question completely. I always give him escape routes telling him that if it makes him uncomfortable he doesnt have to answer. Its basically my fault, i know. its just so hard when you love someone this much. It sucks, its like slowly ripping your heart out of your chest. friends Confessions
-1	negative	health Confessions	You know who you are, I effin   you! I still want you. But am unsure of your feelings about me? I don't want to be a damn fool, in love with someone that doesn't love me!
-1	negative	health Confessions	You knowYou ask them to do something for you & it doesn't get done. You ask for a simple request, and they don't do it. You ask. And nothing happens. Jack A$$
-10	negative	health Confessions	You left me standing there alone in the dark wondering if you were ever really there at all.  It all happened so fast and it felt as if a lifetime of love and breath was sucked right out of me.  I didn't know what to do.  I didn't know if I could take that first breath without you there.   It was as if I was frozen in time and I had to go look in the mirror to see if I looked different.   I needed to see what I looked like right after my world had been changed forever.   I saw myself free but still loving you and despite the tears, I still looked worthy of love. friends Confessions

-1	negative	health Confessions	You're so ugly           nobody wants you.
-7	negative	health Confessions	You're so wrong if you think I'm embarrassed of you. That's so far from the truth. I hope that's not what is happening in your head.Just cause I don't share every thought in my head - it doesn't make your imagination king. You're just wrong.I admit, I f*cked up by not taking advantage of, apparently, my ONE opportunity to REALLY talk to you F2F. Neither one of us did. Why do we suck so bad?That's why I just want to meet up and talk. ONE frickin' conversation could fix everything. I don't want to lose you. You consume me. Obviously!I don't rescind any offer I've ever made you. I'm NOT embarrassed. Ive told people how I feel. My parents would love you now.I just wish I could tell you to your face. I'm not a miserable person but this is making me sad. Really, really sad 
-10	negative	health Confessions	your message I got it loud and clear but I am sorry sweetie I no longer feel that way for you anymore, plz understand and all I want is for you to move on because what you are doing to yourself is just not healthy at all.

Why does this keep happening to me. Is swear the universe is screaming it at me. I just don't know just it is that I souls be doing? You just know how I feel, I have somewhat told you.

I wish you could just give me something to let me know this is real.
-1	negative	health Confessions	your parent's are not exactly role models, and will not be around years from now when your brain is fried toast. Sorry they do not love you more to tell you this.
-4	negative	health Confessions	Your real pic + some married guy's initials = somebody from his real life could figure out who you're talking about. No, it's not likely, but it could happen. That is why you're not supposed to be giving other people's personal information here. Look, I'm sorry you had a bad marriage. How exactly does that justify pursuing a married man?

-5	negative	health Confessions	You seem to trust me enough, surely you must because you wouldn't have shared the fantasy otherwise. But now knowing what I know, I'm not sure how I feel, it's not surprising you'd think of me as domineering throughout all aspects of my life, but it just isn't true.  And this, this I'm not sure I can do. No, not even for you, I feel like I'm never In fact I'm almost certain, with you I will never explore the things in which I crave to seek clarity.

-9	negative	health Confessions	You tend to not remember the horrible things the one you love did to cause you all the pain. There's a reason why we aren't together and that's because you betrayed me and broke my heart. For some reason after the anger fades away I'm left missing you like crazy. I remember the fun things, the loving things and the thoughtful things. But none of the horribly painful things you have put me through. I find myself wanting you back so desperately. But why? You caused me more hurt than anyone else in my life. I've never felt so completey destroyed and unwanted. I never want to experience that misery again, I don't think I could handle it. So, I need to keep reminding myself that you being gone is really the best option. I have a chance at real happiness without you. You would only cause me more pain. What I'm trying to say is, I don't want you anymore because I'm better off with you not in my life.
-2	negative	health Confessions	You think I should find out for myself? Oh s!
-3	negative	health Confessions	you think you can take her away from me you are dead wrong if you think, your little comments, and putdowns make a difference you are dead wrong love conquers all and while you sulk in frustration and anger we both will keep calm and carry on

-4	negative	health Confessions	You were a stronger man than you seem to be now. I thought you could think for yourself, had some wisdom. Faith. I really wish I had been right.Good luck.
-4	negative	health Confessions	You were never mine to begin with. I belong to someone as do you, but by the look in your eyes, I feltyou knew how much we belong together. We have to part our ways and inside the tears are pulling at the corners of my eyes. My heart burns and there is no other person whom I would want to be beside other than you. We both don't belong with the ones we are with, we belong together and with those three little words wanting to escape from my mouth, I keep them inside. It would be foolish of me to say them. What if I am completely wrong and you do not desire me the same way as I do you? We have always been strictly platonic but deep inside of me there is such a deep yearning for you. I don't know if our paths will ever cross again or if I will ever regret not telling you how I truly felt.
-1	negative	health Confessions	You were the one that left without a word. Not a single word.  Do I deserve this? No. No. No. Enjoy your new love, love.

I just want to be skinny and have a nice , but i just can't excercise i dont have the time at all, and my  seems like its getting smalleer and i want to make it really big so it will look good. Someone please help, cuz this sucks, especially since kids make fun of me and mess with me cuz i'm not pretty.
-5	negative	health Confessions	 Ever since i can remember i've cared for all the people around me and their needs and wants. I had an abused mother who was so injured and needed my emotional support since i was 4 and im an older brother so i was naturally predesposed to take care of my younger brother. This would be something i would be ok with if it werent so draining of my emotionshaving from a young age been so careing of those closest to me i find that now that i am an adult and trying to have adult relationships..i am not capable of being close to anyone or understanding what they feel or need. I find my social interactions strained..how do i get close to anyone? I feel disconnected from litterely everyone. Every situation or discussion i am in i always feel.outside.

Every time she saw me, she said pass by her home anytime when I'm around. We loved eachother and romantically involved. She moved away, and told me let's stay friends. She had a picture of her and a boy lip kissing togeteher. I sent her emails that I hope she was doing fine and that I missed her. Her personality changed, andshe called me rule and said she was uncomfortable with my messages. She said she couldn't handle them, and we could not be friends. Right now, I feel heartbroken. I was such a kind person, and she called me rude and "please stop messaging me and ps". Feel so hurt inside I have a mild disability (Cerebral Palsy) ..but feel a good attitude is more important!

-8	negative	health Confessions	I am sorry for not talking enough. I don't like being shy. And when I do speak to the one I desire it seems like its not enough. I want to ask her, but I don't want to hear her say "I can't". I've heard her say it before, to others. I pray we can get closer and maybe then I'll ask. I want to take her to see "Man of Steel". And then kiss her perfect lips at the end of the night. But that can only happen if I ask.
-10	negative	health Confessions	I cant speak with him, hear his voice, text or call him and I want to resist the urge to answer if he should contact me at all. I have entered break up detox. He filled my time when I needed him too. I can see now that I have many good things and he was fun, nothing more.  Now that he is almost gone I want to erase him . I will not give anymore He could have had me heart and sole. He chose not too. So I refuse to be hurt any more, cry anymore or waste my time anymore.

-1	negative	health Confessions	I've been crying off and on today. I don't really have anyone to talk to or just be with. So much has gone on this past two weeks and it's not been good. Now I'm alone. I need someone to be with if just on line.
-8	negative	health Confessions	No, I don't know. How can I? I'm not you. If it looks like a duck, walks like a duck, and quacks like a duck, am I just to take your word that it's a horse? You speak so many contradictions and this wasn't the first time. How am I to believe you? How do I trust you? I could trust you now, but I would be a fool to do so, because later on you'll just stab me in the back. As much as I want you, I do not need you. I've existed before you and I'll exist without you. I don't need anyone. I want someone I can trust.
-4	negative	health Confessions	the exact moment I stopped caring about my husband. He's also emotionally distant and hardly says anything. I asked him for only a half hour every week to talk. He missed it our time to talk. From that moment on everything changed for me.

And with her a couple grown  skanky daughters. My father inlaw has became a alcoholic. Even when he doesn't want to drink she gets some booze anyway. He has gotten in trouble with the law more time than I can count.Almost to the point of serving prison time. And what does every situation that is horrible in his life have in common with eachother? 2 things. The booze and the bi%ch! ..feels good to vent.
-4	negative	health Confessions	  your  , whatever was real leaves permanent scars. It's almost impossible to fullydescribe the feelingbut it was like a light bulb inside of me that for the first timeshed a strong light, clearing the darkness from the corners of my mind. Just a feeling of complete peace and acknowledging another, feeling them inside you. I'm actually glad it happened although I say otherwise at times. I think It's the need to possess that causes pain though; not love itself. funny Confessions
-1	negative	health Confessions	You sound like you've given up with me.Would you blame me?Promise me you'll never stop trying.I'm here, aren't I?
-6	negative	health Confessions	 I appear to be a healthy and together individual. Inside, I have a constant nausea. I despise so many things about myself. I feel incompetent and incapable of doing anything right. I feel like an idiot, I feel ugly and powerless. It's a side I show no one, and so everyone I involve myself with is only seeing a shadow of me, while the other piece of me rots. I smile, and I'm charismatic, but really I am numb, and I have forgotten how to feel anything. I wonder how anyone would love me if they saw what kind of person I was underneath.
-6	negative	health Confessions	 I'm gonna end it tonight. They said I should love myself. I give myself mercy. So much longing, pain. I have made mistakes, but I could not have done otherwise. There is nothing for me or in me, just long painful day in and day out. There is nothing to talk about, nothing to do. I have lived a long painful lonely selfish life, and it is time for mercy.

-10	negative	loneliness	10 years ago my husband left me because I cheated on him.  I cheated because we did not get along. Communication failed and cold war happened. We have two teenagers.  To make long story short, after relationship with two different guys I am still lonely.  We are still legally married because the divorce paper came back incomplete and I changed my mind to pursue the divorce because I am hoping we will be together again. I want him back but he is in relationship now. I was told by our friend that he still loves me. I do not know what to do. It looks like he is happier with her.

Idk, as I lay in bed right now I wonder what his doing and all I can imagine is a Sargent yelling at his face, ahh, I wonder if he thinks of me as much as I think of him right now. I look forward to getting mail from him. I know it's not even a week but I find myself running to the mail box when I hear the mailman come, I probably look like a little crackhead
-2	negative	loneliness	17 days till he leaves.. and then 109 days till he returns. Im scared of being left alone. Scared of the future. 
-8	negative	loneliness	29 Palms: So he's gone now and I am stuck in a city that I only know a couple of people. I moved here for school and him but I won't be starting school till the summer and I'm still doing school in a Oregon. When you come from a big city, parties, going downtown, and what not, then come here and have absolutely nothing to do is driving me crazy. I need to meet more people but since it's such a small town it's hard and for me, it's usually not.   29 palms/Yucca Valley is a small town, anyone who lives out here wanna hang out? Lol. 
-7	negative	loneliness	2am where do i begin. Crying off my face again. The silent sound of lonelyness, wants to follow me to bed. Im the ghost of a girl that i want to be most im the shell of the girl that i used to know well. Dancing slowly in an empty room can the lonely take the place of you. I sing myself a quiet lulluby. Let you go and let the lonely in to take my heart again. Broken pieces of, a barely breathing story. Where there once was love. Now theres only me, and the lonely.
-15	negative	loneliness	2 days. 2 more days. I've made it 10 months without him. It has been one of the hardest things I've ever done. I can't wait to go pick him up from the airport and see his face when he sees his son. I send him pictures all the time of all the silly things he is missing out on. But I know that its not the same as seeing him all the time. I get him home for a whole month. And oh man I can not wait for some adult time with him. That is part of the hardest things, long lonely nights and a cold bed. I've missed his warm comforting touch when I have a bad day. Oh who am I kidding I crave his touch like a drug addict craves the drug. And now that he will be home in such a short amount of time I've got the jitters like an addict about to get their fix.
-2	negative	loneliness	2 weeks left til I'm in his arms. &lt;3

-6	negative	loneliness	6 months ago I left a cult.  A religious cult were contact with the wonderful, versatile people/things of this planet was very limited. No movies.  No music other than hymns written or approved by the church.  No internet.  No education after high school (my schooling was also organized by the church).  No boyfriends or girlfriends. No intimate contact of any nature before marriage.  No socializing with anyone outside the cult. And so much more. I feel so alone.  Everything is so unfamiliar.  I'm painfully shy and quiet. Don't know how to link on to anyone, especially people my age.  I've realized this society I grew up in has left me so insecure and riddled with emotional baggage.  I know all this makes me sound like a pathetic, lonely, sad person.  But I do have a passion for life.  To live, learn and  one day, hopefully, love.  This new freedom I have is so beautiful. I will never forget how lucky I am to be free.  I will never go back.  Sometimes it's just hard.
-3	negative	loneliness	Aaah I am going MAD! I have been in bed all day bored and not really wanting to do anything! And now my head hurts 
-2	negative	loneliness	A break up left me back at my parents, jobless, depressed, and so out of touch with who I really am. Today I want to try to find myself again. Live a fulfilling and humble life. Growing and learning everyday with out unhealthy dependencies. I hold myself to such a high standard I never want to fall short. Any advice on how to pick up the pieces and start again?
-4	negative	loneliness	According to many people I'm quite understanding and joyful. I listen to their problems and try my level best to fix.  I just wanted to share this with u guys. Takes some of the load off. :')

He was the life of my house he was clumsy and dorky he was always playing. He was full of.life. he loved playing with my other dog who is a terrier mix. He was his shadow. His imperfections made him perfect he was so tiny he left so many memories. That's all we're left with :'( I feel this emptiness inside of me a feeling that wont.go away I keep thinking of all the things he would do of how he was always happy and excited I miss him.. he didn't deserve to die. Not like that.  
-5	negative	loneliness	ACT Mindfulness therapy is the best way that I have discovered in the last 10 years! A book called the "happiness trap" by dr Russ Harris is very helpful in dealing with inner psychological disturbance. It may help you. You can google them both and get results. I hope it helps.
-3	negative	loneliness	Actually, most of the time I don't. But, everybody needs an ear sometimes. Trouble is, most of my friends, even most of the people who start out as teachers and mentors, eventually become my confidants. And then there is no time for me to share. Either way, I come out on top.
-2	negative	loneliness	A dream, not necessarily a bad dream or a depressing dream, although putting it under this group could suggest that.  But it seemed to fit.   
-4	negative	loneliness	A forty year friendship is something I cherish, and living this far away from him gets a bit much at times.   I'm just glad we talk every week.  If we didn't, I think i'd lose it.
-3	negative	loneliness	Afraid is a strong word, I'd say is rather not experience rejection but I know that's part of life. Try not to take it personally, and look at the bigger lesson, easier said than done sometimes.&lt;3
-2	negative	loneliness	After doing some deep thinking I have realised I am not ready for any bloke, it's not the lack of men, it's the lack of my time and commitment. So again it's not the guys fault, it's mine and my opinion.
-3	negative	loneliness	After I post an answer or remark on the boards, and some idiot tries to challenge me rudely because they don't agree, I am just not responding. My mind's not gonna be changed. Their mind's not gonna be changed. And so I am saving my energy and brain activity for more worthwhile activities. Have a good day.
-1	negative	loneliness	A good girl to talk to..I live  in New Jersey
-8	negative	loneliness	A great love? It's when you shed tears and still you care for her, it's when she ignores you and still you long for her, it's when she begins to love another and yet you still smile and say, I'm happy for you
-1	negative	loneliness	All gypsies are from Romania right?
-3	negative	loneliness	All I know is my biggest goal in life is to find a girl
-3	negative	loneliness	All I really want in life is some people I can text and talk to
-1	negative	loneliness	All ive ever wanted was for somebody to care about me
-5	negative	loneliness	All I've got to ask is: Why so much hate?  Love people for who they are, not who you think they should be.
-2	negative	loneliness	all my friends are out with each other with out me, so I would like someone to talk to !
-5	negative	loneliness	All my friends have moved on, got married, kids etc.. and im basically left here by myself.  Im not against gettin out there and meeting new people, but at my age I dont know where to begin.  Where does one my age ( not that old, 28 in a month though..) go to meet new people? Bars tend to be packed with cookie cutter, and often very young and  immature, idiot typeso thats not something im too into.. soo any ideas?
-3	negative	loneliness	All my life I have felt that I am on the outside looking in. Please don't get me wrong I do enjoy some social interaction but I just prefer my own company.
-9	negative	loneliness	Almost two months ago, my 3 month old woke up crying earlier than usual. He hadn't finished his bottle, so I assumed he was hungry. He had this cry, very different than his normal cry. I took him to our bed, held him and he fell back asleep for 15 mins. Again, that distinct cry. He had a low grade fever and vomited the children's tylenol. Off to the ER as my baby never had gotten sick - never, only colic, the usual colic. The doctor at the ER examined him, said it was a virus, very normal for babies. Sent us home. I pray to my baby, and ask him to help mommy feel happy again.
-3	negative	loneliness	A lot of my close friends say its because I can be really mean with people or I intimidate people
-5	negative	loneliness	Alright girls I have a problem. My soldier is in AIT at FT Benning right now and he only has 2 1/2 weeks left. I was admitted to the hospital last night and I have yet to leave. I know that if I tell my soldier he will worry, big time. I don't want to worry him or distract him but honestly he is the only person I want to talk to right now. My mom is planning on coming up this weekend but I don't want her here. I just want him. I just want to talk to him about it and I'm afraid that that's the worst thing I could do for him. He tells me that he thinks of me 24/7 already. I don't want him getting hurt or something because I'm a distraction. What do I do?Do I tell him and just pray it won't affect him too badly? Or do I keep it to myself?
-6	negative	loneliness	Although I am a teenager and still starting out my life, I like giving out advice, especially to people who can relate to my situation. Feel free to message me. I can be busy, but I will be there to listen. 
-4	negative	loneliness	Although I doubt it they exist, but if it was a lady, she would be my queen for life
-6	negative	loneliness	Although I was at the ER today it was a good day. Someone stayed with me the whole time. And someone I have not heard from in a long time sent me a text. Today, I actually felt like someone cared about me. Its been a long time.
-4	negative	loneliness	Always have a big smile on my face,  but if you caught me off guard, you will se the real me. I just pretend everything is perfect, when in reality is not.
-4	negative	loneliness	A man receives a phone call from his doctor. The doctor says,  The bad news is, I forgot to call you yesterday.
-3	negative	loneliness	Am married and lonely as my husband prefers to go out with his mates and comes home to rest and get fed , and no wonder I swing between hating him and loving him , life seems unfair I wish he loved me more then I love him .
-7	negative	loneliness	A month ago, I had a really bad falling-out with a close female friend/crush that came out of nowhere.  We were really close, and I helped her out so much (especially when she went to the hospital in October)I don't know why she would hurt me this badly. It's been a month and I'm still struggling to get over her. I've been trying to concentrate on other hobbies. But recently, with returning to classes at university & my job, I've been suffering bouts of anxiety and depression due to lingering memories with her these places remind me.

-4	negative	loneliness	A month ago, I lost my boyfriend. We had been dating for 1 year, 3 months, and 8 days. I loved him so much. I can't believe that he'd do this to himself. It still hurts everyday. I cry everyday. I haven't been to work in over a month because I can't face being with people who are always smiling and happy. It makes me jealous that I was once happier than ever, and it was taken from me.
-3	negative	loneliness	A mortal fear, I am so scared I'll be alone. I'm not exactly a normal person so find it hard to find people who will accept me. I'm trying to be positive though.
-2	negative	loneliness	And I'm good at it. I'm also good at making people smile and laugh. Wish I could learn how to cheer myself up for once.
-2	negative	loneliness	And I think it's okay to be Not to worry about people's expectations is relieving.
-5	negative	loneliness	And it's time I learn to live with it. No matter what I do I will alway revert to my same old ways and push everyone out of my life for no reason. I am alone now and I will remain alone forever as it should be.
-1	negative	loneliness	And not only because of my anxious personality. I really do enjoy being alone by myself most of the time, but other times I really don't. I think that all people enjoy being alone and with other people in varying amounts. I am one of the people who enjoys being alone more often than being with others.
-1	negative	loneliness	 and that is why EP is good I can now share my thoughts and experiences with others  also reading experiences of others along the way..
-10	negative	loneliness	And then there was one. I get up and I wish the sun would never rise again. When I wish I had shot myself when I had the chance but I can't even do that right. Everytime I see a couple kissing, it makes me sick. And when I lose everything because I was too stupid and believed that someone actually cared. I have nothing left. There is no love in my life, so I replaced it with hate. Constant hate, it's all I got left. Nothing else could love me. And if I lose that, then I've come full circle, it'd be time for me to die. I couldn't live in a world like that after what I endured.
-2	negative	loneliness	And the one rare time I'm not in my room is the time I'm too comfy to go get a blanket from my room for a nap.
-2	negative	loneliness	And unhappy. I have a boyfriend & we live together But even when he's around I feel lonely
-3	negative	loneliness	And while my first response was from someone really nice and told me not to give up, the second was from a troll who thinks it's funny to flame people who just want advice. Then she got a buddy to join her and kept replying to her comment and ugh I'll probably do another  post on this because I need to.
-3	negative	loneliness	An open minded person , who will listen and won't judge me about what I say or how I feel or what I want to do.
-3	negative	loneliness	Another night of work, I should be studying, but I am so fried! One more test, need to pass it to continue on. Need some motivation please 
-1	negative	loneliness	Another of these days that i just feel so lonely that i think everyone hates me..
-1	negative	loneliness	Another one of those days.. I move forward and yet again u manage to pull me back. Want to be free!
-2	negative	loneliness	Another wakeup. Trying to make the best of my situation. Been a while since I have worked. Operation supposedly right around the corner. Its starting to get the best of me.

-2	negative	loneliness	Anytime someone asks are you ok ? My answer will be I'm ok .. Even if I'm far from it
-1	negative	loneliness	Any weird, anxiety filled, cat loving, hip hop listening, unique flower internet addicts out there?
-2	negative	loneliness	Apparently, every guy whose interested in me tends to forget me. At the end find their love of their life. I doubt I'll find one. Couples look so happy but I be upset to get hurt again. 
-4	negative	loneliness	Apparently I cant give specifics to this story (I know I tried). Since it couldn't be approved for the content because  I'm still single I'll give the PG version. Basically I have suffered abuse from my future mother-in-law for 2 years now.  Her constant berating and belittling has affected my self esteem and personal life. I'm just looking for some additional emotional support so I can keep my sense of humor and maybe receive some helpful comments.
-1	negative	loneliness	A precious life gone too soon, now an angel shining like the beautiful moon.  
-2	negative	loneliness	Are my emotions supposed to be a roller coaster? I can't even sleep & that's ALL I want to do. Ugh.
-4	negative	loneliness	As a victim of bullying myself, I know beyond a doubt that bullying is absolutely awful. I've grown strong enough now that if I see anyone doing it, I will personally go help the victim out. NO TOLERANCE!
-4	negative	loneliness	As I lay here tonight I'm thinking of what I want in life and all I can think of is I could use a hug right now but knowing I cannot get what I want is making me stronger along the way but then again sometimes you do need to show your sensitive side to make yourself a strong person.
-4	negative	loneliness	As long as I have the internet, music, and books, I'd just rather be at home. The amount of human interaction I get at work is about four or five times what I need, the rest of the time I just prefer to decompress and be alone.
-7	negative	loneliness	as some of you may know from reading my previous story that i lost my child and boyfriend but for the ones that don't here it isthis time last year i was trying to deal with the fact i had just lost my boyfriend, he had cancer, i was young but he was the love of my life and i was pregnant with our baby. 1 year today, 26 weeks pregnant i went in to labour and my beautiful boy was born, he was so tiny and perfect i loved him with every bone in my body but sadly he was taken away from me less than 1 day later, my beautiful boys are now together in heaven, i cant believe how fast this year has gone, i miss my boys so much, i wish i had my boys for Christmas and we could be a family&lt;3
-5	negative	loneliness	At least, that's why I assume my family does it.  I suspect this is because on some level, they still see me as a dumb kid. I know that I'm the least competent member of the household, but I'd like to be able to figure some things out by myself.
-11	negative	loneliness	At the age of 15 I met a guy that I instantly fell head over heels for. He ended up taking my virginity and we dated for about a month before we found out I was pregnant. Everything fell apart. He told me he had another girlfriend and didn't want me to find out like that. At about the 6 month point of my pregnancy I had a miscarriage and it all got worse. That BabyGirl was all I wanted and I was so happy. I wasn't ready but I wanted her. And now I'm broken and it's been almost a month past her due date and I just know that I need a baby. I miss the feeling and I want her back. 
-20	negative	loneliness	A very special someone told me that while some days are all about our hopes and dreams, other days are just about putting one foot in front of the other. Today is a very significant day for me because it is the first time since my miscarriage that I haven't cried. I went back to work last week but on Tuesday I decided that I still needed a little more time to grieve. I just wasn't ready to sit behind my desk and pretend every thing was ok. So I've taken the past few days to recoup. I've slept in, eaten more junk food than I probably should have, listened to soppy music and just cried about my loss. No one was watching my every move to ensure I wasn't having a nervous breakdown; it was just me, God and my angel baby.  But today something changed.  Not only did I get out of bed at a reasonable hour, I wasn't a blubbering mess either. So I'm giving myself a pat on the back and hoping that this is just one baby step in the right direction. 
-1	negative	loneliness	A woman who has a weak bladder  Thanks
-5	negative	loneliness	Aww look at the cute ba..NO Whenever my baby cousin comes over who is fat and ugly we have to lock my dog outside just because he might violently lick her.Doesnt help he is a pit bull and trust me he is such a big softy.Also the door to the backyard is see through so he is sitting there crying while my baby cousin just sits there laughing
-1	negative	loneliness	because I never had the opportunity to be innocent. 
-10	negative	loneliness	Been out of high school for a long while now, during the time of my graduation till now I've lost friends and only have a few that I actually talk to. I had my fair share of bad relationships until I found one woman who changed my view. We both love each other tremendously but recently she decided she wanted to have an open relationship. I did not like the idea but decided to try it. As far as I know, she hasn't been with anyone else yet. I was lonely until I met her, now I'm feeling a bit lonely again because of this change in our lives. She said she misses the mystery and excitement of the dates but she wouldn't fall in love with anybody else because I'm already the one she wants. I don't know what to do. Having someone to talk to will make me feel less alone.
-1	negative	loneliness	Being lonely is not nice especially when it is caused by your own insecurities and low self esteem because you lock yourself away from the world. Not giving someone a chance cause you think they will laugh at your flaws/imperfections is sad.
-4	negative	loneliness	Being lonely, slightly different from being a loner. Of course I often find myself lonely. I think most people do, at times. But, I know that I have felt this way for my entire life. I do enjoy being alone, and I wish that I really could just truly accept that I enjoy being alone all of the time, but I don't accept that, and I do know that I am a lonely person.
-2	negative	loneliness	Being single for about two years, I feel embittered by it as I project some of my disdain onto many of the other amicable girls that come into my life, regardless of whether or not they are love interests. I take it out on girls that don't deserve it and I realize that I can't stop being mean to them.jective about things we are constrained to our desires.
-2	negative	loneliness	Being single isn't the best thing I just hope I find someone to love
-5	negative	loneliness	Being used is the worst thing in the world. You think you mean something to someone when really, they just use you. I think the reason I let people walk all over me is because I am afraid to be alone. I am afraid that if I let people know how I feel, they will leave me and I will be completely alone. And I am scared of that. I let people walk all over me and make me feel down about myself. The people who I thought loved me most use me and hurt me to make themselves feel better and that kills me little by little every single day. One day I won't be here for their personal needs, and when that day comes. What will they do?
-2	negative	loneliness	Blood doesn't mean family. Family can be blood, friends, anybody. People in your "family" will be there for you and show you the love and respect you deserve.
-1	negative	loneliness	Bored. Any one wanna talk ??
-1	negative	loneliness	Boredddd someone message me
-1	negative	loneliness	Bored on a Saturday night.. What's everybody up to??
-2	negative	loneliness	Born To Die by Lana Del Rey  Don't make me sad. Don't make me cry. Sometimes life is not enough an the road gets tough I don't know why. Keep making me laugh, lets go get high. The road is long we carry on. Try to have fun in the mean time. Come and take a walk on the wild side. Want to kiss you hard in the pourin rain. You like your girls insane. Choose your last words, this is the last time, Cause you and I, we were born to die.
-3	negative	loneliness	Breakup Day 1 - constant thought.. I know its his right too but wish he wouldnt cause its too soon.
-5	negative	loneliness	.  My final advice is to work towards your goal. Set yourself a final goal you want to achieve, be if a marine biologist who explores the seven seas or an animator working for pixar. When you have a goal to work towards, you are unstoppable. Leave the dregs of your life behind and achieve much more. Always believe in yourself. I wish you all Godspeed.
-1	negative	loneliness	Broken inside surrounded by all who love me yet I still feel lonely. 
-1	negative	loneliness	 When everybody around u is laughing, smiling and seems so happy.. and ur there just sitting, so broken and hurt
-3	negative	loneliness	Bullying happens everywhere. Its not fair, it definitely isn't right, but it happens. They are stuck with how pathetic they truly are.
-15	negative	loneliness	But I'm learning to deal with it! As a child, I was seldom told no by my loving family. Then I entered the world of strangers and failed to realize I would not be treated the same. I used to think I was better then other people and would become silently enraged when they got higher opportunities then me. Now, I understand everyone has their strengths and weaknesses, and the people that get far have patience, humility, and the ability to work hard, connect to other people, believe in themselves aside from making comparisons. I still to this day get mad when I see someone doing better at want I want to do, but I catch myself two seconds after, tell myself it's wrong, take a deep breathe, promise to treat them and myself kindly, and choose to coexist instead of compete. My time has come and will continue coming as I shed my ego. 
-3	negative	loneliness	But the real question is: "If there is would I like to meet them?"
-5	negative	loneliness	can anyone shed some light on MEU deployments this will be my first deployment with my marine and his first I want to no what to expect!
-2	negative	loneliness	Can someone help me figure out why I like abuse. I can't get it out Of my head it's blocked by something I can't figure out why!? Maybe if someone could help me and talk to me to help me figure out my problem!?
-1	negative	loneliness	Can someone please message me
-1	negative	loneliness	Can someone please talk to me I'm really bored and in really kind
-2	negative	loneliness	Can someone please talk to me? Message me!!
-1	negative	loneliness	can't even go out without my sis saying "you went out and got a fix aye?" 
-9	negative	loneliness	CASTING: Do you have something you have been keeping from your girlfriend since you started dating? Maybe you intended on telling her when the time was right, but the opportunity never arose. Now you are ready to tell her, but not exactly sure how to go about doing it and you want to do it before she finds out from someone else. 
-1	negative	loneliness	Chat anybody? I'm looking to have some fun and a laugh with somebody?
-5	negative	loneliness	Completely alone. No friends, no one to talk to, no one to love or to love me, no one to share anything with. This is not new though, this is a perpetual situation in my life. I just feel the need to vent for some reason, even though I know that no one will read this and no one will care. I've always known I'm going to die alone, and be alone until I do die, one way or the other. The realization of that fact doesn't make it any easier to accept. But, it is what it is, I suppose. 
-2	negative	loneliness	Could really just use a friend right now. Just someone to talk to.
-1	negative	loneliness	Could you be my other crazy, goofy, happy, totally insane half???
-1	negative	loneliness	Cute girls message me lets chat
-5	negative	loneliness	Dam it's hard to meet the right person that u can really trust and have a connection. No guys cuz damm there a really bad example 2 me cuz they ain't real. Girls some but there cool hmu!  I really want 2 make a new friend this year 
-1	negative	loneliness	Day 1 of the breakup Breathe again
-3	negative	loneliness	Day five. I feel numb. I miss him so much and it kills me. The not knowing.. Am I on his mind? Does he miss me? Is he sad? Is he counting the days too?.this is awful. But I know when I talk to him I'll be SOOOO happy.
-2	negative	loneliness	Day six. I doubt it will be any better but at least I have school to pass the time. I miss him so bad. 
-4	negative	loneliness	Day two without talking to my marine. I'm going insane.  I hope school goes slow today to pass the time. Don't know what I'm going to do to keep myself busy. Ughhh.
-3	negative	loneliness	Dear life, I hate you. You have made my years empty, alone and full of pain, abuse and rejection. You have brought me so many people who have hurt me, put me down. Why? I know that I have worth. So tell me life, Why does no one see it?
-11	negative	loneliness	Dear Rizzy, I felt like you were near me today. I felt so happy. My day was so good. Blake has been such a gentleman you'd be proud. I finally got him to go one day without cussing! Welli think.. But we still walk by your locker and it reminds me of all the memories. So back to the first thing, were you near me? I felt like a balloon with a patch in it today. Like i could be fixed. Maybe i can be fixed and one day someone will make me feel as beautiful and loved as u did
-1	negative	loneliness	Deep deep down I hide every thought. I'm shut out from the world. I have plenty of friends to talk to I just don't share my personal thoughts. I'm guilty of some many things. Sometimes I hear a voice screaming for me to tell just one soul. But I can't. I lost my trust many life times ago
-9	negative	loneliness	Deployment. I'm really having a hard time dealing with it and it hasn't even happened yet. I just want some experienced ppl opinions on this matter. Does it get easier? How u dealt with it? What to expect from it? BTW he's in the national guard so I didn't even think this was possible. Please help! I have questions and need answers!!!!!
-22	negative	loneliness	Deployments SCARE me My man is in Marine bootcamp right now and yes he is active duty. His MOS is vehicle maintenance. Alot of girls on here have a man who is deployed either in japan, Afghanistan, or wherever. Anyway that is the scariest thing to me I hope and pray mine doesn't get deployed even though EVERYONE says he probably will be, when he joined he never thought he would have to he never mentioned it as happening since he CHOSE to stay in the US. I know it is a possibility. & IF it happens I will ALWAYS be faithful since he's the only guy I've EVER been with i will NEVER leave him. I just want to say to all you girls waiting for your man to come home from a deployment you guys are so strong, i really hope mine never has to but he might/; I will stay strong, and so will you guys, please pray for my man to not get deployed & i will pray for your man to come home safe, sound and so fast. Anyway that's all just really worrying about it and he's only in bootcamp UGHHHHH.
-4	negative	loneliness	"Distance is not for the fearful it's for the BOLD, for those willing to spend a lot of time alone in exchange for a little time with the one they love. It's for those who know a good thing when they see it, even if they don't see it nearly enough." 
-4	negative	loneliness	Does anybody else feel like you'd like to see how your family and freinds lives would be different without you. And what they'd say to you when your near death? Or just me?
-2	negative	loneliness	Does anybody have an idea of how long a leave you receive after returning from a year in south korea?  
-1	negative	loneliness	Does anyone else get that feeling that they are just invisible and mute to every one but this lonely feeling lasts for monthshow do you pull yourself out of it
-2	negative	loneliness	Does anyone have a body pillow? I do. I feel incomplete without it when I sleep. I cuddle with it and I feel so secure and safe and happy. I fall asleep so fast with it. It's so comfy and it feels like it's holding me back.
-3	negative	loneliness	Does anyone know how to train a 9 month puppy to potty outside during walks, especially if you're moving from a house to an apartment?
-2	negative	loneliness	does one of your fantasies wearing a wedding dress?and be a bride someday sissies out there?
-1	negative	loneliness	Do I dare ask I will not be able to fly.
-3	negative	loneliness	Don't get me wrong, I generally like people and I'm fairly out-going, I just don't like getting too close to too many people. I don't mind the 'spotlight,' or being the center of attention, they're just not something I yearn for, and that's okay with me. Also, I just get too tired to make new friends all the time. Not that I'm afraid to put the work in to get to know people. Losing touch is easy, whether my friends get married and have kids, move away, become 'too cool' for me, begin to work too much, don't like that I don't do drugs/drink, whatever it may be, I'm eventually left alone. The thing is, I really don't need much in life, whether that means friends, girlfriends or whatever. I've conditioned myself to enjoy a very minimalistic life, so even if I don't have that many people in it, my cup runneth over. And that really is the truth. 
-2	negative	loneliness	Don't have many friends and it's really starting to weigh on me. Just want someone to talk to so I can be a little distracted from my day to day routine. If you're interested you can message me! If not, that's okay. 
-3	negative	loneliness	don't tell me I'm not alone, because at 3:27am on a Friday morning when I'm smothered in my darkness with heavy thoughts and what ifs clutching my tear stained pillow, I sit up and look around the room to see that the only person here is me.  And I am so alone
-7	negative	loneliness	Do you ever have that feeling of just being lost? And by lost, I'm referring to it in the mental and emotional take. Right now, I'm not sure where I am going in life. I always had high grades in school and that has lead me to become a Biochem major. I don't even know what I'm going to do with this major. It was expected of me to be something that was honorable and respectable so I chose one of the majors that people consider to be difficult. I know that I am capable of completing biochem successfully but my heart isn't in it. I would love to do something creative for my future but I feel like the disappointment from my peers would not be worth it. Confused, lost, and soul-searching.
-1	negative	loneliness	Do you know what it's like, to around so many people and yet feel so alone?
-3	negative	loneliness	Do you think it's possible to get depressed at any age? I do cause I believe I've been depressed since the 7th grade .. I know life isn't easy , who said it was? Sometimes I feel like crying  Sometimes I feel like dying  I know 100% that I'm trying

-1	negative	loneliness	Due to the controlling nature of the relationship I am in the last 3 years, I have alienated all my friends and family to appease my partner who doesn't like any of them or want any of them around.  My heart is so broken at the revelation of him being an abuser.
-3	negative	loneliness	Dwelling in the pain I can't get through. I just want someone who can be there for me in this miserable days. I want to end this pain  Can someone help me?
-1	negative	loneliness	Especially when I'm in my room all alone and nobody to talk to. It's boring and frustrating at the same time. Because either I have bad thoughts or I'll just feel unhappy.
-2	negative	loneliness	Especially when they say one thing and everything about it was a lie -.-
-4	negative	loneliness	Essentially this will probably offend many people as it is for some unknown reason taboo to express hatred for dogs.  I am surrounded by many who love dogs, but I cannot stand the creatures, I am now uncomfortable in my own home. So if there is anybody who feels similarly I look forward to chatting.
-11	negative	loneliness	Even if you have been rejected so many times in your lifethere is a good chance you won't be rejected anymore.   Stay strong.   Childhood rejection, love rejection.there is always one that is going too eventually who's is going too help you say good bye too rejection forever.     You will be so secure with this person, but you need too give the person a chance.    You have suffered but you need patience with the next person.   You need this person too teach you about rejection.   You most like have been rejection a million times.the next person i guarantee will teach you the differences.   Even if you have a spat with her.you will know your  not rejected.   This is the magic of a secure relationship. 
-1	negative	loneliness	Even though I have friends and family that love and care for me I still feel so alone. Maybe I just need someone to talk to or just try just not to be so needy. I just feel like there's something missing.
-4	negative	loneliness	Even when I'm in a house filled with people I feel alone.  My parents don't really talk to me and I just feel like a stranger in my own home. And it's the same when I go to my dads. I've cut before because of this loneliness and I want to stop feeling like no one wants me around.
-14	negative	loneliness	Ever since 'HE' left me  There's a piece missing  I feel distant with my family  With my friends  With my classmate  Like it wouldn't even matter if I was in the room or not  I find every excuse to be alone  I'm happier when I'm by myself  Only because I try to be nice to everyone  But people  make me mad   I guess the piece that's missing is happiness
-5	negative	loneliness	Ever since I was 10 I layer in my bed,stared out the window,and listen to music watching for hours.i remembered how much it broke my heart when I saw all my friends hanging out and walking past my house like nothing's wrong.and the rooms the only place I can be alone.is this normal?
-6	negative	loneliness	Ever since my best guy friend moved away, I been left out alone. I like someone tho'. He's a quiet guy with the cutest smile!  He's dorky too but shy. I wish there was a way to attract him! Please respond if you know a way to attract shy boys. He's really adorable.  I feel left out but once I see him, I smile!!!
-2	negative	loneliness	Ever since my sister left to the army, I have absolutely no one to talk to about personal stuff. I do have my parents around but they always seem to pay attention more to my niece than they do me. All of my problems have been bottled up lately and I just need someone that understands me.
-2	negative	loneliness	Ever since we broke up im excluding myself from the very few friends i have.. Cz i feel lonely and its hard to explain it to them
-7	negative	loneliness	Everybody around me, all of the background conversations, they make me cringe. I'm not arrogant I simply think that today's youth is concerned with such petty little matters that it sickens me. Whenever I'm at school, I mentally face palm at least  seven times.  I stay under the radar and I've even been accused of being a snotty hermit. No, love. It's not that I don't like to socialize, it's that I'd rather eat my own thumb than hang out with idiots that talk about nothing other than the new ios7 and Miley Cyrus' VMA performance. 
-4	negative	loneliness	Everybody is just busy with their business, nobody seems to stop and asks one another how is their day going. I feel that everybody is drifting further and further away from me. I know that is a part of growing out. New friends taking over old friends. Everybody still continues with their life and not bothered to know people thoroughly. /:
-6	negative	loneliness	Every day, I get ridiculed, why should you care what I wear and how I think. I don't show you all how much you hurt me.   When I get home, this is the only person I can talk to. The only person who doesn't judge but offers comfort and help. Thank you Experience. I'm hanging on.
-1	negative	loneliness	Everyday I paint this fake smile on my face to mask the pain. I used to be so happy and carefree now I live everyday with fibromyalgia pain and depression and I can barely get myself out of bed in the morning. This past week my pain has been so bad I cry myself to sleep. I feel so helpless and I just want to feel better.
-5	negative	loneliness	Everyday is a struggle with me. My hobby is going to the gym and I feel so alone. People seem to stare, but nothing happens after that! I'm not sure whether to have the confidence to stare back more and/or smile. I have no confidence what so ever. Lot of stuff going on in my life. If I at least made one friend going to the gym I would be so happy, but it feels impossible :'(.. I need advice big time.
-3	negative	loneliness	Everyday, its like I'm waking up to be surrounded by strangers. Those who should love and care about me, avoid me like I'm a ticking time bomb, 5 seconds away from exploding (which is mostly true but besides the point).  All I need is someone, anyone that I can actually feel connected to! Anyone to end this feeling inside. Someone who accepts me for who I am and doesn't think that I need to change, and that although I am full of faults, I can be perfect just the way I am. 
-2	negative	loneliness	Every friend as a child 'magically' stopped talking to me after a year.  My last best friend as a teen, she married my dad and tried to be my 'mom'.  Dad blamed mom's raising of us as why we (sisters & I) could not keep friends. They got married in 1999 and I just finally found a 'true' I'm there for you whenever and always kind of friend   Need I keep going?
-6	negative	loneliness	Every guy I meet rejects me because I'm either too clingy, like I'll get upset when they don't call or text back right away, or they see that the person they met when we were drunk Is not who I am at all when sober. Or they reject me because I jump to conclusions and assume things a lot. Or it could be because I'm not putting out or I put out too early. I pray I reach that state.
-10	negative	loneliness	Everyone always told me if I just be myself that people would like me.   But most of all I want to say to the child me.  I forgive you.  I understand you had to go away.  You had to leave that horrible place to survive.  And although my mind has shattered and I am left fragmentedI see you and I love you and together we will get through this and become whole once again.
-1	negative	loneliness	Everyone needs someone to help them back up when they're down.  If you need me, I'm here 
-4	negative	loneliness	Everything is different here in Fairmont. It's almost as if I stepped into a parallel universe. Guess I'm going to have to bribe her to come down here too. 
-4	negative	loneliness	Every time I like some one I tell my self to get over it at the beginning because I have no chance to get her this is the worst way to live
-14	negative	loneliness	Everytime I meet a Nice girl, I used to ruin everything Well 2 months ago I met this girl, and she's really friendly to me. Just today my class said that I told them I love her. I never said anyone Bc normally we would C a movie this weekend I want to give up. Im 16, never had a relationship, and all the Nice girls ignore me when I or my class ruin it Im hopeless. I dont know anything anymore. All I want now is to dissapear from this world. Just a littlebit of luck would be great now. I dont know how long I can live like this anymore Please some1 Nice Send me msg. I need some friendship
-6	negative	loneliness	Every time i try to talk to someone i really want to talk to we hit it off pretty well! But the next day comes and i really want to talk to them again and I'm always ignored and i never talk to them again.. I don't know why they keep doing this but sometimes it hurts and its really annoying and sickening after awhile! How come people keep doing this??
-1	negative	loneliness	eyyyyy all my friends are asleep sooooo
-1	negative	loneliness	Fake smiles everyday when really you want to cry. Everyone thinks am that happy girl who's got a great life but the don't know me.
-1	negative	loneliness	Falling, So lets stay in the good old days.
-10	negative	loneliness	Family is there to support you. Right? then what's wrong with mine? My dream is to travel to japan. But I'm not allowed to speak in a different language at home, and I CONSISTENTLY have someone in my family that says I'll never make it and even if I do I won't like. They ALWAYS bring up the negatives, like womens rights aren't as good there. But you know what! I DON"T CARE!!! I want to go there. And I just want you to support me not tell me it'll never happen! You all tell me your loving and supporting, well if that's true STOP TELLING ME MY DREAM WONT COME TRUE!!!! Try encouraging me or if that's to hard, just SHUT UP! I'm so tired of hearing it. It hurts and I've cried for so long over what you think. So just shut up. Only person has ever supported me in my dream and she still does, and i love her for it but you know, i still feel like my hopes are just illusions and i still feel alone in everything i do.
-9	negative	loneliness	FB GROUP Because I was always feeling down at a certain point in my life and wanted to talk to ppl and even wanted to help ppl who were going thru the same feelings and problems as me (sadness, loneliness, etc) I made a FB Group called Scars Never Heal. I managed to help ppl and of course I made new online friends who I joke around with whenever I'm on the site. It's helped me a lot and if you ever feel like you wanna talk to someone but no one is around, check out this group. There's always something to do and always someone around to talk to you and help you out. 
-1	negative	loneliness	Feeling a bit choked & prisoned in things, need to chat it off 
-2	negative	loneliness	Feeling alone, married but my husband is everywhere but here with me, just need a friend to listen!
-3	negative	loneliness	Feeling kind of lost, my husband suffers from schizophrenia, In the past it has never been this bad, feeling so alone!! Everything has to do with him, what's wrong with him that day.  I have 3 children with him and work full time.  My energy level is almost completely depleted.  He has been off work on disability for his mental illness.  Our marriage has gone from one of love and friendship me Hating him, not because I hate him but I hate his illness.  So lonely, I am not sure if I can keep up, I need a partner, I need my husband.  Not sure what to do
-5	negative	loneliness	Feeling pretty lonely. Its so weird how we feel so bad when we are all by ourself. When I was younger I never thought that being with other people was actually necesary in order to function normal.  The thing is we need others in order to do this. We are dependend. If you are hungry, you buy some food. But when your lonely, you are not in control. You just got to hope that there is a person out there who will care about you
-2	negative	loneliness	Feeling so depressed right now. It seems like noting really can cheer me up. I can't see no hope. Don't feel like "talking" literally. But I would like anyone who can chat with here.
-2	negative	loneliness	Feel like life sometimes, often even, is in control of me, not me in control of my own life. Get a bit depressed sometimes, but maybe no more than most. Probably a pointer to the fact I'm not entirely happy a lot of the time, although a lot to be happy about really with two lovely children.
-14	negative	loneliness	Few years(bout 6 years) back I had a girlfriend.  We fell for each other kinda hard. We talked, played games, did what ever we could  . Done so for bout a year nearly two .she accepted me for who I was. Her dad didn't a prove of me. And took just about everymeans of talking to me away from her. She would sneak away to talk and hang out with me. She was scared of getting caught. Then one day she disappeared. And I never heard from her again. It tore me up and since then I hadn't been with anyone. I guess I really haven't gotten over her completely. Notings ever been the same since either. I've been feeling lonely and lost.    
-2	negative	loneliness	finally got to hear his voice last night  it makes everything so much easier just talking to him.
-4	negative	loneliness	Finding life hard with my recovering alcoholic wife, I've lost myself doing everything to keep her happy I now hate myself and really have lost some feelings for her. She puts me down all the time and is just so mean sometimes, but changes and is so sweet I'm loosing it
-4	negative	loneliness	Finding someone who actually wants to be with me in a real relationship is the thing I want most. I've been looking for a long time, but have only found heartbreak and pain.
-2	negative	loneliness	Find your soulmate ! Life's to short to be unhappy . Depressed things are not going right? Feel your heart is missing something? Let me fix what should of been
-2	negative	loneliness	First I was exited about my weekend trip with my friends to a ski resort but I'm not now!! Cus the girls had no sense of fun!! Did it happened to you?
-1	negative	loneliness	#foreversingle #fornow #wantsabf #ages13-18
-5	negative	loneliness	For five years, I've been devoted to my work and survival in this country. As a university undergraduate, I don't really fit with my coworkers. I mean, I like them, they're great people, but there's basically nothing besides work that we have in common: I'm a journalist who works in a kitchen for a living. Well, enouch venting out
-4	negative	loneliness	Forgive me my moment of  weakness.  If there's one strength I have, it's resiliencebut at times I do question how I will summon the strength for Round 2
-4	negative	loneliness	For somebody who is only 17 I've been threw so much in my life. That its kinda crazy. Tonight I'm just feeling really kinda down.  I just wanna meet some real people who are honest and cool and not like the people I've met before. Hopefully soon I can met some people who can change my life
-11	negative	loneliness	For the longest time I have been feeling really sad. I get up and carry on with my typical day because that's what's expected but inside I'm dying. It eats away at my friendships family and my relationship with my partner. People seem to get upset with me and I don't know what I have been doing wrong. I end up hating myself because I must be such a bad person for people to treat me the way they do. I'm on the verge of losing my boyfriend because I can't open up to him and I take my anger out on him
-6	negative	loneliness	For Who will hear Me now, I am alone and alone I shall be. Where I sulk in nostalgia on these Treasured Memories Memories of where it was, of what could of been, of how it turned out. For the cry of Midnight is heard by me,  An owl in the trees, The wind in The leaves, The Silence and echoes, It Bellows. But Last and least, Myself. The one who is breathing quietly and deeply. The insignificance of My Life, It's so short. What meaning can I bring to It. Shall I ramble on forever.
-6	negative	loneliness	From around middle school up until around a year or two ago I had two really close friends (by close I mean we were basically inseparable, we loved one another) and a few other friends, and for some reason the relationships have completely dissolved. I'm not sure what i have done to make them so indifferent about me. The only factor I can imagine would be the fact that we don't see each other very often these days, though i don't believe that that should end a friendship. And I have tried to rekindle them to no avail. I hope this doesn't read as extremely whiny as i feel it does.
-8	negative	loneliness	From the time I started dating my sailor, that was the time I started dating the military too.  I love him and I deal with it, but whenever that free weekend comes by, I'm taking it!
-5	negative	loneliness	From time to time, I look through my photo album I've kept since the start of high school. So many familiar faces that are nothing but a distant memory now.  But no. There's no redos in life.. Including any fatal actions that may occur..
-6	negative	loneliness	Funny how hard it is to meet people in North Bay Being 19 and all, you'd think that someone might want to be my friend But instead, I'm ignored I do have two good friends though, I guess they're the smart ones :D  Anyone wanting a friend to hang out with, I'm always available! Until I get a job that is
-3	negative	loneliness	Fuuny thing is, for all my talk, I never really say anything. And secrets are not really secrets, otherwise I won't be telling them.
-1	negative	loneliness	Girls Kik@ me!!! Msg for username !
-3	negative	loneliness	god life is so hard, i try so hard with ppl who really take me for granted, Why? cos i feel i have to?!  i feel so lonely and constantly in emotional pain.  when will things change.    Arguments all the time and i am always blamed although i try and compromise and understand, however, no one does that for me.  I feel like ending my life cos basically whats the point, i get minimal joyment out of life these days!
-2	negative	loneliness	Going depressed again! I'm going crazy!
-1	negative	loneliness	Going to bed all alone again Some nights im perfectly ok with it other nights i feel extremely sad and lonely Tonight is one of those nights I just remind myself that i will be fine Goodnight
-2	negative	loneliness	Going to try this againLast time I reached out and needed someone to talk to, everyone loved the story, but no one bothered asking or offering if I needed to talk, tonight I need to talkim really hurt, and I feel alone 
-3	negative	loneliness	Got my first 3 letters today!! Only to find out misses me like crazy nothing can explain the feeling you get when you get your first few letters it's incredible !
-1	negative	loneliness	got my first letter today yaaaayy 
-8	negative	loneliness	Got surgery on my right leg the first or second day after I was born. It stretches from my hip to about mid-thigh. When my mom offered to get it removed for me I gratefully declined. Why? Because I think scars are cool looking. And I tell people at the pool I got mine from a shark attack ^.^
-3	negative	loneliness	Guess who just found out she's getting a phone call tomorrow?! This girl! I'm so happy. 
-6	negative	loneliness	happiness. love. and dedication. I found all of those three years ago when I got accepted a part of my high schools dance team. it feels just like yesterday I walked up to the paper hanging on the door with my tryout number on it. everything felt so surreal I remember crying tears of joy bc i never in a million years thought id have such opportunity. dance has shaped my life completely and now as a senior i don't know if I feel the same anymore. I no longer love the thrill of performing or even get happy over the thought of it. I feel like it's time to let go.. but how do you let go of something you love so dearly but know it's best to go/:
-4	negative	loneliness	Happy new year everybody,sorry im late in greeting everyone ive been so busy but better late than never! Anyway, another year gone by so fast and a brand new year right at us, and in this new year i wish you all the best, best in life, happiness, love and success. Great year ahead everyone! We'll make this better than the past years, leave before all behind because this is a brand new chapter, a brand new start for all of us. SO ONCE AGAIN HAPPY HAPPY NEW YEAR TO YOU ALL!
-17	negative	loneliness	Happy or sad.. you look around and you may find me crying.. I try to hold back the tears.. but I'm weak.. It's not because I'm depressed or anything like that.. I heard someone say that I have, "the gift of free-flowing tears". It started when I was pregnant with my first son. I was watching a McDonald's commercial and the baby in the commercial got really excited everytime he say the "golden arches" and cried when it was out of his line of sight. I thought it was because I was prego and an emotional wreck.. But nope. Still crying to this very day.. Watching some Christmas movie on Hallmark.. sad.. lol.. 
-7	negative	loneliness	Has anyone experienced an event in their life and no one understands about it? It has been a topic in my life where it came to the point where i finally realized that no one will understand, my story is crazy. Look, i am not depressed about it or searching for validations on the facts that i know, the truth is insane yet it makes a person sane
-3	negative	loneliness	Hate being tall wish I could get short no matter what!!
-1	negative	loneliness	Havent been on in a long time so message me ^^
-15	negative	loneliness	Have you ever been in a crowd and felt like you were the only one NOT being accepted into it? Like everyone else is socializing with each other while you're smiling at what they're talking about and you don't notice it but everyone starts closing in on the circle, cutting you out of that crowd? Well, that's how it's always been with me. I'm the different one. I am proud of it. I think being different is a BEAUTIFUL thing. I'm in a-whole-nother world, by myself. It gets lonely over here being 15, bisexual, single, weird, kind of anti-social and awkward is kind of bumming me out. I want to talk to people my age, get to know them and Have a great time doing so.
-5	negative	loneliness	Have you ever felt so alone that you thought you were in a dream or a coma and you wished someone would wake you up or try to help you but no one can.
-1	negative	loneliness	having a bad day physically, longing to curl up with and hide in the arms of a special lady..
-1	negative	loneliness	Having an abortion is a tough decision. And to this day I feel extremely guilty about what I did, yet I feel like I can't tell anyone without being judged. No one really knows but I beat myself up over it every day. I'm not sure how to move forward.
-1	negative	loneliness	Having depression for me . What you see is not the real me 
-10	negative	loneliness	He betrayed me and i forgot after two weeks he did it again, and i said all right forgave him . After a month, i found out that he is with other girl , i was like lets be more patient but after 10 month i had enough because when i did one and only mistake which is talking with friend , he forget me like he never did meet me
-25	negative	loneliness	He called me last night. I needed that so much!!! I love hearing his voice. We have gotten so much closer in just these two crazy weeks with him packing & leaving for training. But I think it's gonna be a great experience for us. I feel so much stronger already & it really made me realize how much I love him. He even said the same! We are gonna be ok  & I'm gonna be there every step of the way for him. He tells me every night whether on the phone or texting how much he appreciates me & loves me. & once he gets to afghan it's gonna be a little more rough on him but I always tell him how tough he is & how smart he is! He got a promotion! Now he is an Environmental Safety Officer. Has his own squad and everything! And if he does good (which I know he will) he will be promoted to SSG! So that's has helped him stay encouraged!
-9	negative	loneliness	He comes home today.    My boyfriend who is currently at Walter Reed rehabing from being injured had been on leave for the last 2 weeks and home visiting his family in Texas.   He was named Spirit of a Hero 2014, I am soooo proud of him.  We will head to Texas in May for a parade in his honor.   but I am so excited today is the day he returns from Texas to Walter Reed of course what happens today it starts SNOWING!!!!   I'm crossing fingers, praying, and checking the airline website constantly to verify that the flight is on time..     just a few more hours and he will be out of Dallas and in the air   I cannot want to see my Marine, especially since his Alive Day is tomorrow!   I cannot wait to spend it with him!!    Come on weather be on my side!

-12	negative	loneliness	Hello.anyoneI jus came back fro work today,I work the phones for tech support for a big company.

For some reason I still have a cell phone, the oldest thing you could imagine, and there the only contact that will answer is my mom. I am outgoing, will looove to go out, anywhere, and do anything, I have tried going by myself, to bars, movies, parks, restaurants and so on, and it was the worst possible idea ever, I jus felt really bad, only in public this time. Nice people online tell me that eventually I will find someone.sure

-3	negative	loneliness	Here is a link to a Free Personal Development Audio Book - I hope you can gain something from it :-) 
-1	negative	loneliness	Here's the thing, I'm a 18 Year old, Over-weight, sad, loner. Sound good?  I've only had one boyfriend and sometimes I just miss the idea of it, the idea that you are with that person, you're a pair and To be honest, I miss him because he was more like my best friend and friends is what I need right now.. 
-3	negative	loneliness	He said he likes me but can't be with me. Wants to marry me later but can't b with me now Confusing?
-8	negative	loneliness	He's a quiet guy & shy & dorky that doesn't seem to care about me. He's my crush & today I told him Hi but he didn't look. He said something but I'm not sure if it was for me cause he was looking somewhere else with his friend!!! Ughhhgghh ! What'll get his attention? ;(
-2	negative	loneliness	He's loving the TDY in L.A. He's having so much fun, and he's experiencing so many cool things. I'm so happy for him! I just wish I didn't miss him so much.  USAF love!
-9	negative	loneliness	He's something out of a rugged version of a fairytale. He's a hopeless romantic, thoughtful, compassionate, hardworking and faithful. He's a hero in most people's eyes and in mine he is the love of my life.  I love him and will never let him go for as long as our love lasts, my hand will always reach out for his, and my heart will always sync with his. He is my military man and the man of my dreams.

-11	negative	loneliness	Hey everyone, I just signed up for this so I'm completely new to how things work. So here I go..  I am a 22 year old female who is so confused with her life. I am about to graduate from college and I still am unsure what I want to do career wise. This is my fifth year so I'm basically graduating just to say I accomplished something. I don't have any friends to talk to and my family just always says "they support me in whatever I choose" which is great but doesn't really guide me anywhere. I have had really bad experiences with advisors and don't know who else to talk to. If any of you are going through the same situation or can relate feel free to message me.
-3	negative	loneliness	hey girl yes you :D  In open sky I m trying to count star I Know its countless  Same as My love for You 
-3	negative	loneliness	Hey guys! So if you are reading this, know that you're special and privileged. You have to work hard to earn happiness. I am happy but not satisfied, I'll keep progressing until I win!!!
-3	negative	loneliness	Hey guys!  This is just from my perspective from my point of view with my friends. U guys may have different views but i just wanna express myself haha.
-11	negative	loneliness	Hey guys I have heard a lot tonight in this experience that it's about school and friends.  Plus I know being 38 how could I possible know what it was like to be a kid, let me try. They say that High School is the most important 4 years of your life, it will make or break you.  Yeah back from 1991 to 1994 they seemed to be the most important years of my life, but the last 20 since I have left High School seem to be just as important if not more then.
-6	negative	loneliness	Hey guys I m alone at my place no is here and I m feeling so bored so anyone who is looking for a friend text me
-5	negative	loneliness	Hey guys! I need help from my fellow supporters! My man has been deployed for not very long now. But I miss him like crazy and haven't been able to talk for three days now. So I'm trying to think of what to send to him! He is deployed overseas. So what should I send him? I know the restrictions. But what would be meaningful and useful? Thank you for the help!! 
-1	negative	loneliness	Hey guys, so in band class I have to play drum set and my face  turns bright red. I love playing drum set but my face looks terrible.

-4	negative	loneliness	Hi guys its spicebuns happy new year 2014!! Hope you got your xmas pressy a d what you wanted, .spicebuns * btw typing on iPhone not ipad so its a bit hard)
-3	negative	loneliness	Hi I am a married mom of five . Most of the friends I had were coworkers at a job that I no longer work at..so I need other adults to.talk to on a regular basis..I'm here as well to just listen or give advice as needed.. even with a house full of people I still feel lonely at times..
-2	negative	loneliness	Hiii I'm 17 and new msg meee : ))
-15	negative	loneliness	Hi Ladies, I'm new to this site and this is my first post. I'm about to be 18, and I'm a senior in high school. My Marine is currently in MCT, and going to go to his MOS soon. We got to talk for the first time in 3 weeks yesterday (I was so happy (: ) and he brought up that he's been thinking a lot and wants to get married! I love him very very much, and I'd actually thought about it too but now it's kind of become a reality and it gives me butterflies thinking about it. I was wondering if anyone could give any advice about young marriages? I know a lot of people don't support young marriages, especially out of high school. I'm not exactly sure how college would work for me if I moved with him to his base wherever that will be. I think part of what's holding me back is I'm afraid we won't be able to be financially stable:/ any advice would be greatly appreciated 
-8	negative	loneliness	Hi ladies! My boyfriend is at MOS right now and i want to go see him in March with his parents for a weekend. I was wondering if your boyfriends are at MOS in Virginia, or has been there and u guys known the rules for liberty. Or if there is a website that i can look up the rules. My boyfriend will probaly ask his officers but i just wanna make sure i dont want him getting introuble. Thanks ladies! 
-7	negative	loneliness	Hi  ! My boyfriend will soon go into training for the Navy Seals and im actually very nervous. He told me everything i should expect such as the long deployments he will have and missions he wont be able to tell me about. Im not sure how to react to this. Im willing to be patient and strong for him but Are there any other things i should expect? Any navy seal wives/girlfriends that can help me with this?
-7	negative	loneliness	Hi, my name is Josh and I have been pretty lonely for some reason. I have one close friend I hangout with and then there's random people who tag along. Their all pretty nice but I still feel alone. I haven't had a girlfriend in 8 months so that makes me feel alone. We dated for a little over a year and we were really close. We don't talk anymore though. I miss having that kind of company around. Yeah guy friends are cool but I miss the feeling that comes with having a girlfriend. I miss having someone to cuddle with and tell them I love them and all the stuff like that. I just want that again and I can't seem to get anyone. It makes me depressed.
-1	negative	loneliness	Hmu whenever who ever you want to talk  
-4	negative	loneliness	honestly i dont need someone to talk to me but having someone to always come home to and talk about my bad day would be nice. since the only people that really understand me is people on here
-5	negative	loneliness	Honestly, I've been really cranky lately and I realized it's because I'm lonely. I have friends to hang out with and I have hangouts via one on one but I still feel lonely. It's not like "oh I need a boyfriend" lonely, I think it's more of a "where is my best friend" lonely. Sadly my best friend is in VA while I'm in TX. It's hard to communicate while we're both in college. I wish I could find someone to connect with. Not exactly replace or fill in because that's not fair to my bestie. I miss her.
-1	negative	loneliness	Hope everyone has a great day today
-1	negative	loneliness	How come I feel so lonely when I'm surrounded by people?
-2	negative	loneliness	How do you face your fears? How can you change something that you have no choice or/and control over? I've always been very patient, positive and one of the strongest people you'll ever meet, but building up negative energy and not releasing saying anything makes it so much worse..
-1	negative	loneliness	How do you replace a person you had so much life with, there is nothing, my life stands still .i had 24 years with this beautiful person, i will take me just as long to mend, just my throughts of you, trying to live out yourmemories day to day, and hoping there enought to fill my life Rightnow i'm on your birth, by the times, its my time to pass, i'll be on your passing,and then we'll meet again, i hope and pray, god do not leave me here that long, because with out you, my life just don't seemtomatter.i forgot what being happy feels like,i'm living out a long term night mare ,how can something so sweet, just get taken away, just how do i breath? when i just sit here looking off into space,i hope i'm not disappointing you by given up on my life, but i'm going throught the hard days, i wish this on no body, but i wish this was not me. .page39
-2	negative	loneliness	How long is the longest deployment you and your marine have gone through?
-5	negative	loneliness	How much alone have you been? I have been most of the time.. So i started loving the lonely silence, the lonely streets, and being lonely most of the time.. Sometimes i feel good but sometimes it feels very sad.. I get very upset thinking about past and future but i live in present..
-1	negative	loneliness	How often do guys think about their ex after a breakup
-4	negative	loneliness	How to deal with a forced break up by girls parents? :'( I try to ask but I can't stand this. It hurts so much knowing how hurt she is because of her parents not allowing her to see me. What is the best things to do?
-8	negative	loneliness	 This is for all you military girlfriends and wives! This makes me smile  I love seeing my Airman!  Especially when he surprises me. I love being in love with my military man, and I am so proud of him and everything that he does for this country and for me.
-2	negative	loneliness	I actually have my period now, and it freaking hurts!! 
-5	negative	loneliness	I almost did for good but my sister followed me so I brought her back and I got caught and they made me talk to the cops on the "dangers" of running away
-2	negative	loneliness	I always ask for people to leave me alone even though I don't mean it. I'm starting to miss all of my old friends I think I pushed them all away. I just need someone to make me feel alive again. I just talk to a lot of boys to make me feel wanted even though I know there focus is on one thing
-6	negative	loneliness	I always feel like I'm alone in a house full of people. I am a people person, but my bf and I are very different. So his friends are not people I have a lot in common with. He says I need to be more open and not so judgmental. I don't judge, I'm just picky about people I have around myself and my kids! He says I'm sheltered because I don't know anything about the streets. I always that that was a good thing. I always figured I don't need to know any of that stuff because I don't associate myself with those kind of people. Just always been my choice, just like people have the choice to do drugs I have the choice to not allow it around me and my kids! I don't see this as a bad thing, but apparently it is.
-1	negative	loneliness	I always fight my loneliness and depression by "music and books and coffee" i think its the best way to skip the reality.
-4	negative	loneliness	I always lie to people and say I'm fine. But I'm not and it kinda hurts when they believe me. But it's kinda my fault for that. I am not going to just say I'm not ok when people ask because I don't feel like explaining why and them not understanding. I feel lost and worthless. No one will ever understand me and why I feel this way.
-2	negative	loneliness	I always seem to push people away. I don't hav friends and most people don't even know who I am, I hate life to be honest just want to die already
-3	negative	loneliness	I always shut people out of my life.  maybe im not as strong as i think i amor want to be.
-1	negative	loneliness	I always want to stay alone isolate myself eat to forget my agony and start over a new life what should i do?
-1	negative	loneliness	I am 13 and all my friends have or had a girlfriend but not me I am very jealous of them and would do anything to be in a relationship with some one
-1	negative	loneliness	I am 16 years old I need some friends people to talk to. Please? Friends that aren't jerks.
-2	negative	loneliness	I am 18 year old guy and just looking for someone to talk to. I don't care what I talk about I just want to share someone's company. I don't care what age or gender you are as long as you are intelligent. Thanks and have a good day!!
-16	negative	loneliness	I am 18 years old, i been in a relationship for about 4 years My boyfriend and i had some problems in the past, he was talking constantly to another girl that cused our split up but we ended up geting back togetherthings changed, it wasnt the same and i started seeing another guy. He found out but told me he loved me.. I stoped seing the other guy But the thing is that i wish i was single.. That i could go and have fun with guys like i used to. I want to tell him that we should just be friends but its kind of scary to imagine him with someone else, but i want to be free and experience new things. I dont know if its love, or if we are just so used to eachother
-17	negative	loneliness	I am 20 years old. I just moved 300 miles from the place where I grew up because I need a job and there are none where I came from (it was a coal mining town and the economy has drained it dry). I have no friends here and I've been here for like 4 months. My boyfriend decided he wanted to come with me, but I think that he should have stayed. Since we've been here, he has become distant and his personality has gotten violent to the point that he scares me. I feel trapped. I cant pay for my place by myself and I'm so terrified to be here alone. He says that all of the problems we have in our relationship are my fault Idk if something is wrong with me that I just can't connect with people But I don't want to feel alone anymore.
-4	negative	loneliness	I am 21 years old, and have not had a real friend since I was 11or any friend for 6 years. I am now in university, going to class everyday and going over the same routines. I talk to my classmates but basically have no life outside of that. I have a job that some might be envious of, but if they only knew that I would do almost anything to trade.
-4	negative	loneliness	I am 23 I have never had a girlfriend and am just so lost in life. I feel so alone, sad, and unmotivated. I pretend that i'm okay and act like I don't feel totally depressed but when I am alone and it's just my thoughts and myself it's hard to stay positive. I tell myself that if I had a girlfriend I would be happy I just want someone to be with someone that I can hold. I am too scared to try and get a girlfriend due to lack of confidence and fear of rejection.
-1	negative	loneliness	I am 23 year old and I am serching good friend
-6	negative	loneliness	I am a 22 female that needs someone to talk to about anything. I'm having so much problems trying to figure out who I am and what I wanna do with my life. I should know all this by now and I don't.  The years pass by and I'm in the same spot. My relationships end quickly. I can't fall In love  I will have amazing feelings for you and one day I will wake up and not feel a thing and that's how it ends. I can't trust my own heart  . I wish I had a man in my life that drive me crazy but I can't even get to that point. Everything is just too complicated !!!
-4	negative	loneliness	I am a 27 year old Single Dad, facing multiple problems at this point in my life. I have always been a nice, helpful guy, and have done what I could to help others before myself. Now, I'm reaching out for help. This is my last resort. supernova (at) psend dot com
-1	negative	loneliness	I am afraid of rejection. It's always scared me even since middle school and elementary school. my big fear is that people won't like me and won't want to be my friend, just like all throughout elementary, middle, and even some of high school. this has highly contributed to my social anxiety. I don't wanna be afraid, but how can I not be?
-29	negative	loneliness	I am afraid of what people will think. If I take that chance to express myself, and they don't feel the same. I can live with that.  It's having to see them every time. Knowing what they think and what they've Probably told all their friends. It's just so awkward for me. I guess it all roots back to kindergarten (yeah yeah I know what your thinking kindergarten is kindergarten what could have happened ) but I had a crush on this boy and I told my then best friend about it. " Amy (let's call her that) don't tell anyone but I like Bryce"  (again let's call him that) she then gets up from where we were sitting and starts walking. I say " where are you going Amy ?" She says to tell Bryce. And I am like "what  I just said not too" and she goes to him any way. I try to run after her but it's too late. I swear the whole room started laughing and spinning. I got over it then but it's still in my mind. I think that's one of the reasons why I'm so shy. And have a fear of rejection.
-2	negative	loneliness	I am a lonely soul. I'm waiting patiently for someone to hear my cries and wipe my tears away.
-1	negative	loneliness	I am always bored and the only way that I can distract myself from my own thoughts is usually by having people to talk to. But I don't have anyone to talk to, so I am still consumed by my own thoughts every day.
-3	negative	loneliness	I am a newbie man from cambodia! I am 23 years old!! I wanna make friend! Pls contact me!! 85510877879
-20	negative	loneliness	I am a new member at EP, I met a nice married man here (or so I thought) not long ago, we got along well & became close friends. We talked on a daily basis up until today. Few days ago he willingly sent me a photo of his sons (without me asking for it). Tonight I asked him wether he wanted to see a picture of my daughter & he said yes  but I told him that he could only see her from behind, meaning her face wouldn't be shown in the photo, he got offended and said "let's just say goodbye"  and he immediately blocked me. I feel so hurt & I just can't understand why he did this I mean how could he end our friendship just like that?
-4	negative	loneliness	I am  an outgoing girl and I always made my friends happy,but sometimes ,I also feeling unhappy and no one could talk to me 
-6	negative	loneliness	I am a really hipper guy, so people always shot me down. Now I'm a shy guy, I don't talk to people much and I don't really know how life works staying In a house locked up not allowed to go any were is bad feeling, makes me think. We're did my life go to, I have yet to find out.
-7	negative	loneliness	I am a science student in university, I want to be a doctor really bad but don`t know if I have the grades for it. My friends don`t think i am and its hard to talk to them about it.
-6	negative	loneliness	I am a secret bisexual and in total, helpless, pathetic love with a girl on my swim team. There is no way I can escape her because our team is very small and so is our school. I can't speak to her anymore because it hurts so much. How do I stop loving her? I can't talk to anyone because everyone where I live is really biased against anyone not heterosexual. I can't escape her either and she used to be a friend so I can't just cut her off, she is already picking up that something is wrong. Any advice?
-3	negative	loneliness	I am a single male with no children, family or a wife.  I live in a small town in the middle of NE.  I am disabled and do not work.  I try to make friends, but people only want to be friends with other married people with children so I always strike out.
-14	negative	loneliness	I am a teenager and i have my small business. I came from very poor family and i work hard to finish up to college.  My only wish before is to have a beautiful family which will care for you , will show you love every time and can talk to when you feel down. I had a broken family since when i am young. I started to work when i was 7yrs old. I can make money, can work in order to have food and support my study and my family.   I had a mother but she is very terror so that i grew up with no good relationship to her. And every time i will remember the time we (my brothers) suffered to her i cannot to stop to feel not angry. But i keep on telling myself that she was still my mom that God gave me  No one know about this even my brothers and her. So that i need someone to talk to and I decided to write on this site to share this thing. Thank you. I have many more story to share but i think its enough for this time. Thanks. NEo.. 
-2	negative	loneliness	I am at the point where I talk to no one at all things have gone very downhill very little hope
-4	negative	loneliness	I am a wife and mother.  I've stayed at home with my kids for 12 years, and now desire to do something for myself. I'm 37, and don't know what I want to be when I grow up.  Feeling like I stink at everything.  I don't have a hobby and I've never felt more content then when my babies were little Now it's time for me to branch out, and I'm stuck
-15	negative	loneliness	i'am a younger lonely girl i laugh I pretened like nothing is happen but inside it'q like forest in fire i loved someone so much and never believed that there is life after him, i never imagined that someday he will leave me but he did . he left me after faliing in love with him , he left me after i gave him everything specialy my virginity , i have only 16 years old and because of him i'm not vergin. for u guys it s a normal situation but in our contry it s forbbiden if my familly knew they will kill me like the word hello , if the people who live in my country knew they will say a bad words of me . but the worst thing i don't have future, i can't marry and have kids because no man will accepte me , i always feel like i'm lonely because no one know what i'm into , i wish if i can back in time just to fix this fault which is never leave this man come into my life 
-3	negative	loneliness	I am a young military girlfriend trying to figure out a way to cope with not being able to talk or see him.  I didn't see him much before he joined because we went to different colleges. But now it's worse cause it hurts. I'm trying to be strong but most days I wonder if I can handle this.
-1	negative	loneliness	I am bored.  there's nothing exciting in life these days. Is there anyone?? Lets talk
-3	negative	loneliness	I am bullied day after day and no one bats an eye. If I disappeared they wouldn't even care or even notice. I have 3 friends and no one likes me. I am a disappointment to my parents and everyone else around me. I'm in the dark screaming but everyone walks by.
-4	negative	loneliness	I am completely guilty of doing this. It is a bad habit. It is especially easy when you have a difficult time finding some that relates to what you are going through
-1	negative	loneliness	I am currently going to a counselor and im so lonley
-3	negative	loneliness	I am currently travelling for work, and I went out to dinner and had an absolutely gorgeous server.  At the end of the meal, after I paid, I said, "I know this doesn't really matter, because I'm going home tomorrow, but if I lived here, and I told you that you are the most beautiful woman that I have ever seen, and would love to buy you a drink, would you be down to go out?" and she blushed and said, "Oh my gosh, you just made my day.  That is so sweet.  I would love to go.  It's too bad you're going back home in the morning."  I don't care if she was just being nice, it felt awesome.
-3	negative	loneliness	I am deathly afraid of death. Even if it's a death of someone I barely knew, I burst into tears. Everyone who passed away, ever, I still picture them as gone away. Like they're living far far away, in some place, just far far away
-2	negative	loneliness	I am doing a bunch of cute things for my boyfriend in the army. Some of the things I've done so far is made him an army blanket and I sent him a box of "open when" letters  But I don't know what to do next. I always like to have something in line for him next so I can keep him going! I like crafty ideas, no matter how complex or simple so post any ideas if you got some!  They don't have to be crafty, they can just be cute or supportive. All ideas are welcome  Thanks!! 
-1	negative	loneliness	I am far from perfect. Imperfect if you will. I don't like perfect people. They are boring.
-4	negative	loneliness	I am feeling desperate  He is still manipulating me but I am the only one who sees it
-2	negative	loneliness	I am feeling very alone right now, wish I had someone to talk to right about now. I'm so depressed Idk why
-2	negative	loneliness	I am going through a divorce and custody battle with some that has no soul help!
-7	negative	loneliness	I am home alone most days as I have a young baby.  I feel so lonely - I only have a couple of people I know here and no family .  The thing that really gets to me is that the friends I do have never contact me to meet which suggest they don't actually like me.  No one ever calls me and I am sure that if I wasn't here no one would miss me apart from my children.  I'm not depressed or suicidal but I'm developing some sort of social anxiety because I am in a vicious circle of thinking people wot like me so I make no effort.  When I do try to talk to people they either ignore me or look at me strangely!  Anyway,  any suggestions would be good but it's good to simply offload how I feel without feeling like a freak!
-3	negative	loneliness	I am in the process of breaking up with my alcoholic boyfriend. We have been together for one and a half years and I'm just tired of it all. Anyone else gone through anything similar?
-2	negative	loneliness	I am kinda lonely.. I have a few friends but even when I'm with them I feel lonely. That feeling that no one understands and no one realizes how you feel inside is terrible. I wish someone would come to me and ask me what's wrong and actually care and want to hear.. I want someone to care.
-5	negative	loneliness	I am living with bf of 12 years , we have a lot of arguments he lost his job over a year ago and i left mine due to health issues. Yes I'm lonely  i cant talk to him and my friends dont like him so have deserted me!
-7	negative	loneliness	I am lonely and it is hard for me to admit. I wasn't always lonely. Growing up and in my twenties I always had good friends and boyfriends. I move around a lot. I always have, but I always had a way to meet new people. I moved again recently and now I find myself in a new town where I don't know anyone and have no good way to meet people. I'm not the type of person to just go out alone and be outgoing enough to make friends. The friends that I do have, who all live far away, are grown now with marriages and kids and I feel left behind. I kept telling myself it would just take time and I'd meet people, but I feel myself giving up. I feel ugly, uninteresting, and unwanted. I'm afraid that its too late and I am now destined to become that lonely pathetic women everyone feels sorry for. I don't know how this happened, and I don't know how to fix it.
-7	negative	loneliness	I am lonely at home. Recently my mom and I just stopped talking cause we had an arguement. My mom was the person I could tell anything to my friend and the one that I can trust but now we act like we dont see each other. We dont greet, we dont ask stuff, we just walk passed each other and I an not going to be the one to apologise cause I always do that. I'm just gonna lock myself in my room and make her miss me.
-1	negative	loneliness	I am lonely bc I'm waiting for my soul mate. I can't help but wonder if he's really out there?!&lt;3
-9	negative	loneliness	I am lonely because I am scared to get close to people. I never know what to say, what their gonna think of me, if there gonna like me. I do have a few people I'm close too, but that is very few people. I'm sad because I can't connect with people and I feel like I'm alone even when I'm with people. It's like I'll always be alone, and it's never going to end
-2	negative	loneliness	I am lonely. But i used to be popular until my look changed. Now i'm a freak and din't even have a chance to make bewfriends
-14	negative	loneliness	I am lonely. I am lonely and I'm not. One part of me enjoys it. The other part despises it. I'm surrounded by people who love me yet I feel so disconnected from them and the rest of the world. I work a night shift job and every morning when I get off I find myself walking outside and just staring into the sky as if that's where I should be going. I've always been fascinated by the sky and stars and wonder what's up there that I'm always looking for. My home maybe? The answers to my questions? The people I'm "closest" to would think I'm insane if I were to share this with them. I feel like an alien at times. Why am I so different? Why do I understand things in such a manner others cannot? Why do I feel others emotions so direct and vividly? Why why why will be the death of me. Am I crazy? If I am are there others that share this madness? I just crave answers. Maybe not all, but one answer to one question. Why?

-2	negative	loneliness	I am new to this site, but I couldn't be more happier to have found this page and these women! It's been 4 months since my soldier has been away, not including HBL. I realized before my boyfriend actually left how hopeless and alone I would feel with him away and no one around me to understand this experience fully, until now!! :D JocelynCierra
-1	negative	loneliness	I am not perfect and I never will be or want to be. I like getting lost once in a While because it takes me to places I never would gone to.
-4	negative	loneliness	I am not yet a girlfriend of a military man but i wanted to share this story and see for myself what others experiences were ~T.
-7	negative	loneliness	I am on disability and do not work and I can not afford to go out so I mostly just sit around my house. The only time I talk to people is on the internet. I am also very shy so when I am around people it is hard for me to talk if they do not speak to me first. It gets pretty lonely when you have no occasion to see or meet any one.
-2	negative	loneliness	I am recently single and feeling lonely.  I miss having someone in my life, and so I joined this website because it looks interesting and I hope to connect with other people.  
-1	negative	loneliness	I am sick of seeing all these young kids saying they are "lonely". You are young, full of possibilities. Quit whining and find someone else if the one you are with aint working. Try to be 42, no family, no friends, fat, going bald, living pay check to pay check.
-1	negative	loneliness	I am single after about 20 years and I feel like an empty shell. The pain is driving me nuts I have 2 jobs to pay the rent in a tiny town with no dateable guys lol.it's just pathetic.
-2	negative	loneliness	I am so bored all my friends are busy anyone want to chat?
-1	negative	loneliness	i am so disconnected with the human race and every day is just a completely empty existence
-1	negative	loneliness	i am so lonely because of my epilepsy that restricts me and causes my depression which has got better since taking medication but i still suffer in ways
-3	negative	loneliness	I am so lost right now. I've had a crap weekend too. Sometimes I just want to find a corner to curl up and die in. The only thing keeping me going is my children
-7	negative	loneliness	I am so sad that I cannot even walk, my legs and body are heavy. I want to walk up to strangers and say, help me I am hurting, please help me. I walking through deep mud from my legs down. I have no where to turn to, I say a prayer in my head, God please help me, someone see my hurt and help me!!!!!
-15	negative	loneliness	I am so truely deeply sad.  I try so desparately to keep on going but continue to crash into road blocks.  I think it can't get any worse and then it does over and over again.   I am living in this prison and I want to break free.   But I can't.  I don't want to go on but I have a son I adore who needs me and another one on the way.  I lost sooooo much in my life.  My home was fortclosed on, my ex was suing me for custody and I lost my job just about all at the same time and I found out I was pregnant to a one night stand in a casino that I have zero information to even try to track down.  Today my car broke down and Ive just been utterly shocked at how bad my life has been lately.
-3	negative	loneliness	I am so very very very very very very very very bored I have absolutely positively almost completely maybe a small amount of no one to talk to so pretty please with a cherry on top message me and while your at it add me in your circle you never know how much you'll like the conversation we might have until you say hello
-3	negative	loneliness	I am strong. I am willing. I am able. But some days are just so hard. All I can do is sit alone and cry the pain out. I keep telling myself that it will all be alright. Telling myself that I will see him soon enough, even though there is no such thing as soon enough. I'm so proud of my airman, and all I want to be is everything that he deserves. USAF love.
-2	negative	loneliness	I am struggling with picking myself up. I see a therapist, I am on meds. The pain  is more real and raw than usual lately. I have no energy or even want go for a walk. I do what I need when the kids are home and put on a smile. The moment they go to school I get on the couch and sleep. How can some sleep so much?
-1	negative	loneliness	I am terrified of babies and pregnant women, what are you scared of?
-16	negative	loneliness	I am terrified of spiders. The stupid thing is that the "profile" picture for a FEAR of spiders is a spider! I was scared about this and I started freaking out when I saw this! Whenever I see one I feel. Like spiders are crawling all over me. It's the worst feeing ever if you have arachnophobia! I am mostly scared of tarantulas! They are big and scary and hairy and ugly and I feel sick even thinking about it! Not to mention that I love the hobbit! Luckily my dad went once already so he told me when the spider part was and I closed my eyes for that but I saw them in the trailer. I couldn't stop thinking about them. And I don't know where this fear started. When I was little I held a real tarantula in my hand but I wasn't afraid of spiders at that time. I consider Rosy and bad luck name because that was the name of the tarantula. I don't think I'll ever get over this fear! Ewww..
-1	negative	loneliness	I am the misfit. The outcast. The boy who never fit in. Solitude is the only real constant in my life. It seems that no matter how hard I try to connect with people, I always fall out halfway there.
-2	negative	loneliness	I am the opposite of a social butterfly. I have no friends and once I get home it is just so quite. No one texts me or calls me. I just sit and listen to music because that is my only outlet for all emotion.
-2	negative	loneliness	I am tired of fighting. It is time to just give up all together.
-9	negative	loneliness	I am turning 24 this summer. I am a female phd student at a great school.. I am traumatized by the fact that my emotionally abusive boyfriend left me. Deep down I know we are incompatible, and that I will be closer to who I want to be when without him, but it is so hard to be single again.. I fear that I would end up alone because honestly I will be spending the next few years in school, and by the time I graduate, I will be old, and ppl say you can't find pure real love when you are older..
-1	negative	loneliness	I am very lonely and depressed right now  I just wish that a had someone to hug me and tell me that everything is going to be ok but I don't I am all alone
-3	negative	loneliness	I am very lonely. I dont have any friends with whom I can hang out or spent my time. My classmates also even talk to me only when they need help. I try to talk to others but dont know how to held a conversation and soon the chat ends as they stop messaging. I feel very lonely sometimes due to it as even cant share anything with anyone.
-1	negative	loneliness	I awake each morning to start a new day 
-8	negative	loneliness	I badly am craving for dat feelin my friends get.they go out with ppl dey date all day n I dun even hav a friend.  I stay home all day because noone talks to me.i dun even knw if dey find me borin. Wen I make a new friend he talks to me for a while n den starts ignorin. Plz help.
-15	negative	loneliness	I been friends with my best friend for almost 2 years. A few months ago I told her I loved her but she said she just wanna be friends. So we had a fight and I stopped talk to her. We didn't hang out or talk for almost a month and out of no where she texted me and said she miss me. I told her I wanted something more than just friend so she replied saying that's only for my benefits and if I really cared about her than why can't I just be her friend. We became friends again but I still want something more because I'm in love with her. We talk everyday, hang out a fee times a week, and talk about anything and everything without holding back. If anybody else been through this before can you tell me if I should leave or stay??
-8	negative	loneliness	I been lonely for years, even when I was with my ex-husband. He barely spent anytime with me. Now that I am single the men I were seeing either they spend time with me or too busy. I hate feeling like I'm waiting for a text message or a call. I'm a good woman with so much love to give and can't get it in return from anyone. All the other women get it, even those who okay games but I dogged out all the time. Tired of being lonely.
-3	negative	loneliness	I been single for over a year looking for a nice girl .. i get judged on my looks all thr time and not what os inside my heart x i have to wake up everyday and go to bed everynight on my own with noone to cuddle.. are there any genuine girls in the united kingdom left
-5	negative	loneliness	I been thinking about something's that's been on my mind nothing bad just sometimes I would like to talk to once and awhile about the things I tend too think upon lol, I doubt some of my friends in irl could understand.
-4	negative	loneliness	I believe in the world everyone has a twin and ones that are twins, have exact twins like them.
-5	negative	loneliness	I broke up with my ex 7 years ago, and I still think about her every single day since we broke up. She gave me the happiest moments in my life and also the saddest moments. I can never forgive her, but I will never forget her (no matter how hard I try). Hopefully, i find someone that will come and erase her memory from my mind.
-6	negative	loneliness	I broke up with my girlfriend because i was sick of being beaten and hurt all the time now its eating me alive that she might be sleeping with someone she dit even know afterni took her virginity we were together for a year
-7	negative	loneliness	I can blame so many for my loneliness, but it would not be fair. As Joseph Conrad wrote in Heart of Darkness &ldquo;We live, as we dream -- alone&rdquo;, I want to believe that all is for my own personal growth. However, there is a part of me that longs for a warm hug, a sweet kiss, and a kind look&hellip; That&rsquo;s simply the body looking for comfort to fulfill a soul searching intuition. One side of me understands, but the other struggles. Maybe that&rsquo;s just human nature!&nbsp;
-1	negative	loneliness	I cannot describe how I am feeling right now, I am feeling empty but have this sense of overwhelming sadness. Life just seems to get too much for me. I can't seem to keep up. I feel as if I am always standing still whilst everything else is moving and I do not have the strength to move with everything else. Have you ever felt this way? I feel very alone. 
-10	negative	loneliness	I cannot stop crying. Nothing seems good to me and I need something good in life. I need to be content and at peace with myself. I have tried and tried over again and again and I get no where with myself. Life only gets worse, and I have fought all of this alone, I look at others and I wonder why I cannot be as happy and normal as them, and my heart hurts every time I take a breath. I want to hide away forever, but I can't. I can't be strong anymore because the truth is I am so very weak and I have always been and what hurts the most is how nobody truly understands.  
-12	negative	loneliness	I cannot wait until he has his phone back!! I want to send him cute long text messages. I want him to get the right then and there. Instead I have to write it all in a letter that he's not going to get for at least a week. I love writing. But there's just some times I want to tell him the most important stuff and just let him know everything right away. Anyone know what I mean?!?
-3	negative	loneliness	I can't do this. I was doing really good for a week, I was happy. And then all of a sudden everything came back. The thoughts. The urges. Everything. The negative thoughts. The urges to cut. I'm trying so hard to stay strong. The weather is so bad that school's closed, again. The roads are bad so I'm stuck at home, alone in my room, with my thoughts. And if myself isn't enough to drive me insane, my aunt won't leave me alone and is getting an attitude with me out of nowhere. I have nowhere to go and I'm not good by myself. I'm trapped with myself. I can't do this.
-1	negative	loneliness	I can't help itbut whenever someone hurts me I don't have a choice but to tune them out and lose trust for them. It doesn't really matter who you are, if you were to hurt me bad enough I'd just fall apart and barely talk to you. 
-2	negative	loneliness	I can't project my worries, problems, etc on the man I live with anymore. I need someone to talk to. Posted my experience about my relationship issues and have yet to get a response. I'm in a world of confusion, hurt, and loneliness. Can anyone give me advice? The post is on my profile.
-3	negative	loneliness	I cant seem to sleep , watching some tv since I cant seem to sleep someone message me I love making new friends or even helping others 
-9	negative	loneliness	I can't sleep. I'm wide awake thinking about my boyfriend. I hope he's doing good it's been two weeks and I still haven't gotten a letter. But he's been on my mind 24/7. I hope he knows how proud of him I am. And how I can't wait for him to come home. I miss everything about him even all the stupid fights we had. I never realized how much I need him until he left. I'm hanging in there though, I'm being strong for us. I'm one day closer(:
-1	negative	loneliness	I can't wen go outside now because my FRICKING DADS girlfriend says I can't and he just goes along with it!!! I can't go out past 8!!!!
-8	negative	loneliness	I caught my husband cheating on me and found love notes in his bag, he works at babies r us and saying he didn't know how the notes got in his bag, before I found those I found one in his wallet and told me he just found it in the break room and put in his pocket and didnt know how it get to his wallet. What do i do? He keeps denying? Help me? I love my husband so much and we have a 2 years old kid son
-3	negative	loneliness	I constantly feel alone. Like no one accepts me.. I try to include myself but it seems like nobody wants me around.. I cant even relax around my own family because of this. I just need someone to understand..
-9	negative	loneliness	I constantly feel overlooked and ignored. I have a boyfriend of two years whom i have a deep passionate love for, even though he ignores me and doesn't treat me like when we first met. I moved away from him because i caught him skyping and facebooking other girls. I was making myself sick over the jealousy i had over the other girls he was talking to. I also don't have many friends.. Just ones who occasionally hang out with me if i contact them a million times. And even then they ignore me when i try to talk to them. I am an attractive, personable, young lady which is why i do not understand why people such as my boyfriend and my other friends stray away from me and do not want to talk or hang out. It makes me really depressed.
-5	negative	loneliness	I contracted post-traumatic-stress-disorder after a particularly violent year in Rio de Janeiro. I was there to stay with my aunt-in-law's mother who was dying. I didn't quite know how long my brother would need me around. Those of you with PSTD, my prayers go out to you. This is simply a test of our Lord- you can and will make it through with the love of your friends and family. God bless.
-3	negative	loneliness	I could kind of use someone to talk to. I occasionally just talk to myself, which makes me look weird and in turn puts people off me a little more.
-1	negative	loneliness	I could use someone to talk to, just been feeling depressed lately to the point of not living..
-1	negative	loneliness	I count down the days until he comes back and today marks "possibly" less than one month! He has been gone since July and now we are in the home stretch!!!
-7	negative	loneliness	I cry so much. He has been deployed a couple of days. I am so upset and I feel so lame because of it. Yesterday he was so sweet and I loved it. Today I haven't heard from him I am sure he is sleeping though with the time difference. We havnt been apart for even one day in seven months so this is a hard transition. I hope we stay okay and he still loves me when he's back. I know I am being such a baby but its just hard being in a new place with no friends and life is completely changed for half a year.
-1	negative	loneliness	I cut myself two times a month bcz of stupid depression
-1	negative	loneliness	IDGAF anymore.. Everytime I be myself, nobody understands but when I'm silent, they want me to let it out. What's the point of telling you if you'll complain saying that I'm stupid? You told me to explain. I just dunno . I wish I can start this day over!!!
-2	negative	loneliness	I didn't know. I was having something the doctor called "ghost periods". A monthly bleeding that isn't really a period. I thought that since I quit the gym, I'd just gained a little belly weight. I didn't know I was pregnant. When the pain started, I knew what was happening, I didn't need anyone to tell me. I knew. I didn't want to be pregnant. I don't even know if I ever want children, I certainly don't want any now. But, it had been a year, and all I can think of is that little bit of pink. My baby. I never wanted him. I never even had him. But he was there. 
-11	negative	loneliness	idk it's like ever since my bf left for the air force I have no one to talk to. I just feel alone and like nobody is on my side. he was always there to talk to me and tell me everything was gonna be ok and to not worry. he was and still is my best friend. now that I can't talk to him like I usually do I guess I got everything just bottled up. there's a lot going on and I feel like he's the only one who understood it. 
-1	negative	loneliness	I'd like a friend to just talk to and get to know better 
-4	negative	loneliness	I'd like someone to talk to. I'm new to EP, I'm pretty much bored & sad so I'm trying to keep myself entertained. I like making friends and talking about anything really.
-1	negative	loneliness	I'd like to open up more but I feel like I'm bothering whoever I'm talking to, and my life is so hectic I struggle to even begin
-8	negative	loneliness	I'd love to find some girls my age to talk to. I've been through a lot in my life and I've had a hard time trusting people. I just really want a best friend. Someone I can talk to about anything and do a bunch of fun things with. I just want another half because I'm feeling pretty lost in my life right now. No one really understands me.
-1	negative	loneliness	I'd love to kill, everybody in the world. 
-8	negative	loneliness	I do. I prefer to be alone then withy friends. I have long silk black curtains and its always dark, with the lights off, and a night light on. I have my phone, 3DS and games in there. Its like my central habitat. I have water bottles and food in there. And my hamster Dyl (short for Dylan). I have a blanket covering my bed (I have bunk beds, andiI sleep on the bottom. I like a cave atmosphere.) I almost never leave my room. Unless its to go to school, or to the bathroom, etc. Its my dark little getaway. 
-5	negative	loneliness	I do keep to many things to myself. Sometimes I like too. My mind is my world. I make it whatever I want it to be. Nobody can see my thoughts, only I can. So why not keep things to yourself?
-5	negative	loneliness	I do not text ppl very much not to bother them but When I do and they don't text back it kills me I have a friend which we usually talk in whatsapp, whenever she's alone sends msg and I reply back as soon I could but when I send msg she replies so late
-1	negative	loneliness	I do not think people understand truly when someone says they are depressed. I wish someone would listen to me without having to say something about themselves!!!
-2	negative	loneliness	I don't fit in, never have, and probably never will. I don't mind being an outsider. It was a personal choice. Eventually I would have to sacrifice something-I knew that no one would see me the same again when I called people out on their wrongs in mistreating people and engaging in activity that would destroy their lives. It gets lonely sometimes, but the price I had to pay was worth it.  Maybe someday this choice will win me over the right people.
-7	negative	loneliness	I don't get to talk to my girlfriend very much because our schedules are different and we're both busy with work or school, but when I do talk to her - I cherish every moment, every word she says, and everytime she tells me she loves me or makes me laugh.  I love her with everything in me.  She's a loving, honest, and intelligent woman.  I don't deserve her and it amazes me that she loves me.  It hurts most days when I can't be with her, but I just take it day by day and hope for the best.  I love you so much babydoll, and I always will. 
-2	negative	loneliness	I don't have any girlfriend or friend that i can speak to this is troubling me alot and brings me here. How hard it is to find a girl
-5	negative	loneliness	I don't have friends. No social life. The only people I truly spend my days with are my boyfriend, twin sister and now baby girl va. My life is so wrapped around my BF that it puts a strain on our relationship. I thought maybe having va would relieve me of always revolving around him but it hasn't and i'm still lonely as ever. 
-7	negative	loneliness	I don't have many friends. I have 2 people that I can call my friends but they don't live in the same town and are too busy to ever talk to me. You may see me I think I could be happy, but I'd be happier if I knew I had someone I could talk to about thingseven if I had someone there at all.
-15	negative	loneliness	I dont know how to start but here it goes. I am 22 years old and I had been feeling lonely and depressed the last year. My parents are divorced and I hardly see them. I dont get along with my mom, I blame here for everything that has happened. I do see my dad but he is also depressed and that makes me feel even worse. I live by myself and its hard to go to work, exercise and do everything by myself. I try to make time to go out with my friends but I mostly just see them on the weekends. I used to have a girlfriend and the relationship lasted 5 years and i dont know what happened either. I just try to make everything right and it only seems that every time bad things just happen to me. I really dont know who to talk to or what to do.
-7	negative	loneliness	I don't know if anyone has ever felt like this, but have you ever tried so hard/ liked someone but for some reason it just never worked out ever? Kinda like your not good enough. So when someone comes along and likes you it just felt weird, like why would you like me, so based on all your old bad experiences you kinda keep a shield up because you already been hurt to many times in the past. I could use a helping hand, I don't wanna give up on love but sometimes it's like why bother
-5	negative	loneliness	I don't knowit been hard lately. I have no time to see my boyfriend or friends. I know it sounds stupidbut I feel alone. I can't go to school anymore because of my increasingly difficult hard to handle depression. Which sounds amazing to most, but it gets lonely after a while. And most weekdays I have therapy, which leaves me absolutely no time to see anyoneit's silly, I know.
-8	negative	loneliness	I don't know what is wrong with me. I feel so alone. I am always there for everyone. They are never there for me. Tonight I tried to tell my "best friend" how I have been feeling. She didn't care she never cares. If it's not about her or her boyfriend. I help her all the time with her problems. Why can't she be there for me? Why can't anyone be there for me? I just want someone to listen. But everyone's always to busy. It's hard getting out of bed. The only reason I do is because my little brother needs someone to watch him. I don't ever really sleep anymore. All I ever do anymore is cry.
-1	negative	loneliness	I don't know what's sadder:the fact that i'm lonely, or the fact that i choose to be.
-5	negative	loneliness	I dont know what's wrong with me, but I am constantly turned down by every man I meet. I crave love every second of every day, and yet, I cant find anyone to talk to. Depression hits me every day. 
-1	negative	loneliness	I Don't Know What to Do Anymore. My Loneliness wells up inside me and sometimes I just can't take it. I have a circle of close knit friends and I know or can say hi to every other person at my college but my heart They don't know me, they don't care about me. I'm starting to see that even my closest friends don't care about me. And I don't want a romantic partner, I just want friends that care. I have all this love and like and care and snugly affection to give and I give it to my friends but they don't give it back. Am I too nice? What's wrong with me? Why is no one here when I need them most? Why does no one this about me when I'm not around? What makes me so weird and forgettable?  I'm so tired of hurting. I just want to care about my friends and have some friends that care back. I'm so lonely inside here.
-5	negative	loneliness	I don't know what to ever feel anymore, my emotions are all over the place.. I know I mostly feel alone these days. Nobody is ever at my house anymore.I have hatred for a lot of things. I don't excited about the holidays, I have problems with my so-called "friends" and my grades are horrible. This all started with the guy I feel in love with. He was my first love. After he left it went down hill, everything. Also after years of my parents being divorced the tragedy of it has finally effected me. My parents are also fighting, also putting me in the middle of it. I hate it. I need help I want to be happy again but I don't know how to be positive anymore.
-6	negative	loneliness	I don't know what to say . But being lonely has to be a pain that only one can describe only by feeling it. I try to make friends never works out . I have one friend but it is slowly breaking apart . I don't know if there is a such thing as being meant to be lonely . But if there is then I would fall into that .
-1	negative	loneliness	I don't know why but I don't have a bf who loves me and never have. I'm bi but prefer guys. The thrill of being with a married man excites me. I don't mean to harm any relationships but it's what my body wants
-10	negative	loneliness	I don"t know why but sometimes the feeling of wanting to cry, to wonder why I'm like this, to get that pit in my stomach just feels.good. Its weird and I don't know how to explain it but it does. I hate being alone but I like it too. Sometimes I sit and think about it, wondering if there is something wrong, if I'm going insane or if its what being truly alone feels like. I wear my heart on a sleeve and wish my life was just some made up fantasy but its not and it saddens me, makes me hate myself and other people. Sometimes I just want to scream and end it all, then I'll just walk outside to my friends or family and hide a thousand tears behind a single smile knowing they see me as happy and fun when I'm not. Why do I feels so alone even when surrounded by thousands? Why do I feel this way is my sanity slipping? 
-1	negative	loneliness	I don't know why I feel this way.I can't to my mom even though she already knows about it.I can't tell a guidance counselor anything because I honestly don't trust them.There is only one person I can trust and that is a certain teacher.
-13	negative	loneliness	i dont know why it happened.  i dont even think she really did it.july 19th 2012 my mother supposedly shot and killed my father while he was sleeping in bed.  it was with a 357 magnum, they are powerful i heard. and my "mother" is actually my adopted grandmom, so she is like 77 years old!!  old and frail?!?!  able to accurately shoot a gun of that strength and aim and not miss?!  i dunno, but she confessedand her disease of dementia looks like it will get her charges dismissed.  it makes my stomach turn.  and my dad is my adopted grandfather so he was 79 years old.  and healthy, and now he is gone.  and i hate it!  
-8	negative	loneliness	I don't know why it is but every time someone is talking one if my friends has to be rude and start talking over them and changes the subject. He's so rude he has a loud laugh and acts so over dramatic it's ridiculous. It's like all the attention is on him, and that's not even half of it! 
-3	negative	loneliness	I don't like being alone and that's something I'm afraid of I feel like I'm going to be alone forever I'm scared  But life goes on.. I guess I'll have to wait and see.. Sometimes I think that I prefer death than being alone..
-2	negative	loneliness	I don't like that about myself. When im presenting in class im like "i can do this" but once im up there all of a sudden i forget what im going too say and uuugh its so frustrating!!! Then i start shaking and jeez i need to stop being so shy. Ive missed a lot of opportunities in my life fir being so shy 
-4	negative	loneliness	I don't make friends easy, my family isn't a tight nit family by any means I never really had any  parents sometimes I get so lonely it gets really hard being all on your own, with no one there to help you when you fall, but soon it's not going to matter. 
-1	negative	loneliness	I don't mind being lonely, but I hate when I open up Facebook and see people I know doing things. It makes me feel like it's not okay to enjoy being by myself, even though I know it's fine.
-3	negative	loneliness	I don't need someone who thinks I'm perfect, cause I'm not. I need someone who knows I'll make mistakes and still loves me
-3	negative	loneliness	I don't really know what to say.. I've been an addict for years and really need someone to help me by offering moral support or advice.. I'm sort of at a loss when it comes where to go from here :/
-17	negative	loneliness	I don't really know where to begin. I am 28, married with 3 children, but I have never really had a true friend. I say my husband is my best friend, and he is my best companion, but who do I go to when I am mad at him? I never had a true friend that gets me or really cares about me. I thought that was my sister, but we have grown apart in a lot of ways. I can't talk to her. I can't talk to my parents. That brings me back to wanting that true friendsomeone who gets me and doesn't care if I am too opinionated about stuff. Someone I can talk to about things I can't talk to my husband about. I guess I need to find someone as messed up as me. Lol.
-2	negative	loneliness	I don't remember the last time i was happy. I try so hard to keep up with life. I always compare myself with other people. I see them having a great job or graduating college and I feel like a low life because I'm not doing any of that. I have bad anxiety and depression that I can never hold a job or friends. So I have none. I rather stay home and not go meet people because I'm scared they might judge me. I've always distance myself with people so it's hard to make new friends. I'm so shy to just talk to someone.. I always feel alone. 
-2	negative	loneliness	I don't think I've ever been so tired of being alone. I've been so use to the past seven months of having a warm body cuddled next to mine at night. The feeling of being safe in somebody's arms. Now it's went from that to sleeping by myself. I hate it. I just miss having somebody laying next to me, holding me close like they never want to let me go. Like it's only us in the world and we're the only ones that matter.
-8	negative	loneliness	I don't think I've ever really been happy. There's always something missing. I feel as if I tell myself I'm happy enough times, I'll believe it. No one knows how I feel. No one knows how much hurt is behind my smiles. Lately, I've noticed that it's getting harder to pretend and easier to give in. I stopped interacting with friends, stay in my room all day, stopped sleeping, and stopped eating. If I'm not angry, I'm sad. I also have the ridiculous notion that everyone is a liar who is out to get me. The part that breaks my heart is that I know I have a lot to be happy about and that people care and even still, I can't rid myself of the oppressing thoughts/feelings that hurt me.
-15	negative	loneliness	I don't understand why it is that I live in a house full of people that are related to me . I mean its through marriage but I seem to always feel like I am by myself. I feel so alone like I have no one that I can talk to and even when I do it feels like they are not even listening to me. I don't know what to say. Its pretty sad when your are told that your best friend is a three year old and when things don't go someones way or people in the house thinks he is bothering they make him go to another part of the house. Even when my husband is home it still seems that I am alone because when I try talk to him he is too busy to talk to me.  I try telling him what has been going on when he isn't home and all he wants to say is that I am nothing but drama. I just need someone that I can talk to and might understand what I am going through.
-1	negative	loneliness	I dont want to be alone forever. I at least want a dog to keep me comfortable
-1	negative	loneliness	I do sort of feel like I am not going to experience any new experiences unless somebody comes and talks to me
-6	negative	loneliness	I'd really like to have a guy best friend (: ages ranging from 14-17. I want someone I can tell everything to. Someone who will listen and give me the best advice possible. Not one that will ask for inappropriate things. One that I can have a brother-sister relationship with (: one that will laugh at my jokes and accept me for me. Just message me, I usually can answer!
-5	negative	loneliness	I ended up leaving my wife because I wasn't attracted to her anymore because she farted in bed. You can call me what you want: shallow, stupid. But I am so grossed out by girls farting. What should I do? Is there a girl out there who won't fart in front of me? If not, how can I change?
-5	negative	loneliness	I end up having a great relationship sometimes, and then it's just trashed in the end.. Basically what I'm saying is I give more than I receive.. I'm currently working on another relationship, and hopefully it turns into something wonderful. But sometimes, I do have this fear running through my head that I'm gonna end up dying alone..
-2	negative	loneliness	if anyone needs to chat, im available. ladies only please
-6	negative	loneliness	I feel alone, because I am alone. Mentally alone. I've always felt so detached from everything and everyone. I've always felt so far. Or maybe I felt likemaybe I feel like, everyone is far from me? Maybe there's a subconscious question that floats around in my head asking, "Where is everyone?". "Where is everything?" "Where is that brilliant, amazing world?"  
-1	negative	loneliness	I feel alone, craving companionship from a companion who wants to speak to me and like me for who I am. Not just for action. Just want to feel loved. 
-4	negative	loneliness	I feel alone. I need someone to talk to. I need someone that will listen to my stories. I fantasize. I live in my own world and it's not all that far-fetched, but if you could listen to my words and let me hear yours, fiction or reality, that would make me smile for a change. 
-5	negative	loneliness	I feel alone sometimes bc I feel like I'm left out from my groups of friends. I used to have a best friends, but later on around on October something have change. One of my other friend I know start hanging out a lot and stuffs. They just left me there like no where. Later on they hangout together every single day. Ever since that they were friends. We both don't talk to each other much. I'm feel alone and like I have no one to talk to or anything. I just feel left out  and no one like me at all. So since that all happen, I was feel alone and have no one to talk to.
-6	negative	loneliness	I feel as distant as ever from my family and society. I try to find to peace and balance in silence, but the world is so loud. For since reason a memory of my grandma comes to mind. She would sing me a sweet song, and in this song she would call me her sunshine. When I think about it now; I feel that maybe the world doesn't have to be so dark in spite of everything I know. I can be sunshine.
-2	negative	loneliness	I feel as if I'm not able to be fully happy unless I am around someone else. I refuse to label it as "co-dependency" because I realize my life has purpose without others. I just feel as if I should be better at being alone by now (at 24 years of age).Can anyone relate?
-9	negative	loneliness	I feel completely isolated. I'm watching my little sisters in the back room as my parents scream at each other in the kitchen. My mom is losing her mind, slamming doors that sound like gunshots scaring my sisters ( who are 2 and 5 ). It breaks my heart to see my 5 year old sister try and explain to the 2 year old why mom is screaming that she wants to die. I feel responsible for them which chains me to this house, I don't have anyone to talk to. My friends don't talk to me and my boyfriend doesn't seem interested in me when I've got an issue. Everyone around me constantly expects me to stand strong and hold the weight of my family as well as my own issues but today I'm feeling weak and alone. Laugh, and the world laughs with you; Cry and you cry alone.
-1	negative	loneliness	I feel like crap. If anyone wants to talk I could use a friend!
-1	negative	loneliness	I feel like everyone I get close to pushes me away  and then i feel regretful because idk what I did to make them leave me when I needed them the most
-8	negative	loneliness	I feel like everyone is against me and talking about me. I just want to get away from everyone and just be alone with my pets (I don't have any but I want a tegu and bullmastiff). On the other hand, I have convinced myself that if I get a bf then I'll be happier..that may be true bc for once I'll have someone who's not against me..idek what I want anymore
-2	negative	loneliness	I feel like I don't know where to go from here. I feel so lost. I seek God to give me signs but I don't know what to do with them. I don't feel in love as I should and it's literally driving me crazy. I dug this hole for myself and I'm paying the price. Rushing love instead of waiting for it to find me. Unhappy when I should be happy. Living a lie to prevent sad emotions. How do I tell someone that's giving me their love that they're not the one, Just going through the motions trying desperately to run away from my past but can't stop looking back at it.  My heart was so abused but it was the only time I felt head over heels. I don't want him to go through the hurt I went through when I had to walk away. I don't want to carry the burden of breaking his heart, so I sacrifice my heartliving under the same roof and can't afford to live on my own. It's hard to let go but I know I have to, but where do I start? What do I say?
-1	negative	loneliness	I feel like if I die no one will care  At school I have no one I am just the outcast
-1	negative	loneliness	I feel like i got no one to talk to and express myself with like i did with my girlfriend but were not together anymore, i just need someone i can be with i guess..
-3	negative	loneliness	I feel like i have a lot side . These are my side.                                                                   1.  i used to be inoncent,naive lonely girl.                                 2. I used to act agresive and i get mad easily.                                                                3.i used to be so cold and say mean things.           What do you think?
-4	negative	loneliness	I feel like I met the right man just at the wrong time. Has anyone experienced this? I hope it works out down the road when the time is right. We both want our next relationship to be marriage Just scared to be hurt. We've each been through a lot.
-8	negative	loneliness	I feel like I'm screaming at the top of my lungs but no one can hear or like I'm drowning but no one can see me. I've pushed people away and convinced myself that I'm my own best friend. I've tried to get better but everything comes crashing down. It hurts so much. 
-13	negative	loneliness	I feel like I've told this story a million times already. When I was a teenager I was told I have PCOS so severe I would be infertile. I spent my entire adult life believing I was infertile until last January, when I had an unexpected pregnancy. I miscarried at 10 weeks, and last June we started Clomid in an attempt to get pregnant. It worked, and we got pregnant.They gave me a pill to take, and I confirmed with the doctor on call at my office to take it, and moved up my appointment to tomorrow to see if the miscarriage is complete. I spent the night miscarrying. My husband took the day off work to take me to the doctor, and she confirmed the miscarriage was complete. The only remnant of my pregnancy is now a heavy period. I was six weeks pregnant.
-10	negative	loneliness	I feel like my own family lies to me when they tell me my life is important. I feel that no one understand the pain I go through everyday. Each day that goes on I die a little inside. Years of life I wasted and good experiences I've never had. It seems like bad luck is my best friend because it is following me every where I go. Every step I take it's just misery. In my situation life has no meaning. Waking up alive is sad to me. With no purpose what's the point of being alive. 
-3	negative	loneliness	I feel like people judge me before they know me. It's not fair. I'm a nice person and people don't take the 5 minutes to meet me. It hurts
-5	negative	loneliness	I feel like something is missing. Or that I am missing someone. I think I miss myself. But how can that be possible? How can one miss themselves? I think it must be the innocence. The unstoppable momentum of blossoming youth. The inspiration gathered from discovering so many new things on a daily, hourly basis. 
-1	negative	loneliness	I feel like the people I'm surrounded by are so different from me. It feels like I'm drowning and I need fresh air: someone interested in the same things I am, who would be willing to be my friend. I'm not saying I want you, the reader to be my friend, as I really don't need EP in my life, but I wouldn't be against the idea of having someone I can talk to who isn't one of the people here.  This is so vague, and I don't know if you understand it or not.
-1	negative	loneliness	I feel like there is just something about me that nobody can understand.  Maybe my loneliness is my own doing
-6	negative	loneliness	i feel lonelier than when i lived 160 miles away from my home town .everyone has their "cliques"and i am not part of it am on the fringes ..the married ones,the single parent ones the family ones .the mother ones ..the local ones the old school ones ..the others .its pretty nasty to be honest .having no friends and if you do have friends then having to make an effort all the time with them .they have so much more to do with their time ..so many more important  things than giving me friendship ..i guess i hope the socialists become my friends comrades indeed .its really rough not being part of a "clique" even a family one i would be happy with a husband and a dog and a child ..and my hedgeland witchery sitting by the waning fading moonlight .with the fire crackling woodsmoke feeling all loved and cosy :-) not even got that :-(
-1	negative	loneliness	I feel lonely a lot of the time. I never have anyone I can talk to openly about issues in my life that understand and are supportive of me. It feels like I always watch other people have support and people who care about them and I never do. I always feel so alone. I'm pretty use to it though. I feel also its better then having fake people pretend to care about you who don't. 
-7	negative	loneliness	I feel lonely and i dont trust my mother or anybody in my family. I cut myself because of that and other things. I am really depressed and it hurts me mentally. My parents as divorced and they argue alot. I broke up with my boyfriend a couple minutes before joining this site. He cheated on me and *crying*. I just want someone to talk to, someone who can be there for me
-3	negative	loneliness	I feel lonely in a room full of people. I feel like secretly nobody wants me around or even likes me. Maybe I'm insecure and I'm working on not being insecure. But I'm tired of feeling like nobody wants me and like I'll never be good enough for anyone or anything. I don't strive for perfection and I know I'll never be perfect l just want to feel loved. I've searched for love in all the wrong places and it's only made me feel even more alone.
-5	negative	loneliness	I feel lonely sometimes, I mean what teenager doesn't, right? But I love new friends, literally I talk to anyone and accept everyone. It's just sometimes when talking to a male they ask for awkward things and makes me grossed out. :| but if you don't ask about those things, you can talk to me cx I don't judge
-5	negative	loneliness	I feel lost and afraid. I feel there's something missing in my life. I'm not sure what it is. I have this longing. I don't feel like I really fit in anywhere and this life is just passing me by, it feels like a dream, as though I am not actually participating. Ever felt this way?  
-2	negative	loneliness	I feel so alone. 2 days ago, everything was great with this guy I've been with for over 3 years & suddenly he stopped talking, not answering my calls. I felt betrayed because I don't have a clue as to why or what happened.
-3	negative	loneliness	I feel so alone. Everybody hates me. I have no friends. The only person I could talk to was my mom and she is dead. I faintly remember my father. He left when I was 2. My step dad and brother hate me. My brain is holding up so many tears and I can't let them spill out to anybody because they all hate me.
-1	negative	loneliness	I feel so alone in this place I wanna run and never look back hiding the tears is getting harder and harder. Painting a smile on my face is getting harder to do. I feel alone here and god forbid I feel like cutting is my best way out. Somebody help me. :,(
-1	negative	loneliness	I feel so alone.I rarely get texts anymore I'm starting to wonder if there is anyone that care about me at all.
-4	negative	loneliness	I feel so empty. I'm not as sad as I was yesterday but I'm definitely not happy. The guy I like who I was talking about being like a brother isn't the same anymore and rarely ever talks to me. Idk what to do anymore with my life. Can someone help me figure out how to just be happy for once in my life and stay that way for a while.
-14	negative	loneliness	I feel so insecure and afraid. I recently met an amazing guy who is more than I ever thought I would be lucky enough to get to know. He even likes me back and it scares me as I'm falling deeper and deeper in love with him. I'm so afraid he's going to leave me, that one day he'll sit down and talk to me and tell me that he met someone else or that he's not in love with me, just likes me as a friend. I'm afraid he's going to find someone better, than he'll get tired of me, that I'm not what he wants etc. I can't stop getting these thoughts out of my head. I went from feeling so happy and lucky to have him, to extremely insecure and paranoid. I haven't really told him about this yet because I dont want it to ruin anything. I just need someone to talk to. 
-7	negative	loneliness	I feel so lonely. I am so sad . I look back and realize that I used to be happy and blessed. The only thing that makes me happy are my kids. They are the only thing good about this marriage. Every night I go to sleep alone because my husband goes outside to get high and spend the little money we have . I have no one to watch a movie with, chat or even argue . I cry everyday. I want to be happy again.
-3	negative	loneliness	I feel so lonely. I'm isolated from people, I build up walls and keep to myself. I keep my secrets to myself, and everyone I trust has hurt me in some way. I have depression. I stopped taking my meds because they never felt like they were making a difference. I'm just so lost
-4	negative	loneliness	I feel sort of stuck in a rut in life, got so many big decisions ahead, close friends have come and gone but now it just seems to be a lonely time. Sometimes find it hard to share with people around me here, I guess this is what this site it for >.&lt;
-1	negative	loneliness	I feel so strong today after I spend time with my boyfriends family .. Made me realize we're all in this together
-4	negative	loneliness	I feel so stupid. Like I don't matter.  I've tried talking to him, he just says whatever. I've stood beside his brother through everything. We've been friends for years. Ugh. What am I going to do.
-15	negative	loneliness	I feel that if I try, I will be turned down by my friends and family, as I have been for so long. Even by my classmates who only see me as a quiet loner. I can try, but I wonder if I will ever succeed. I haven't been happy for a while, so hopefully I can make it through tomorrow morning when I have thirty minutes to hide in the library at school while my 'friends' enjoy breakfast at their usual table. I hope my ex's friends won't find me there because I get enough looks from the staff and students that find me there alone every morning. I wonder what's the point of being embarrassed anymore, they all know I'm a loser anyways. Lord and Jesus will you be here for me? Send a friend my way?
-1	negative	loneliness	I feel vacant very often now. I feel alone and lost and helpless. I smile because I have to, not because I want to anymore. I just wanna be happy. I want to have a deep love, and be happy. That's all.
-14	negative	loneliness	I fell for someone who had a girlfriend the whole time. I was so hurt. All the things they said to me I remember. The kisses I remember. They touch I remember. I wish we would've never crossed the line because now they are nothing but a memory. We no longer have the potential that we could have had later on. I'm over here sad and they are together. I never end up with anyone. I've been single for so long I think I'm meant to be alone.
-3	negative	loneliness	I fell in love with my best friend after I turned him down, now he is in a relationship with my friend. Now all we do is fight because we can't be friends nor be more than that
-1	negative	loneliness	I felt like I'm lost in the labyrinths.  I know exactly that my problem isn't the worst, but at this point of time, I feel that nothing can get better.
-7	negative	loneliness	If I hear one more time that I am acting the way I am because  David is away. I will lose it. No it's not, but this isn't something you can use as a weapon either!
-1	negative	loneliness	I finally breaking up my almost 5 years bf.., But Just Like that,,
-5	negative	loneliness	I find humans does allot of stupid things.  Between drinking, smoking, harming the environment,  wars and many other things we don't need in the world.  But allot of humans don't care. They want their pleasure, they want their power and they don't care if it may cause harm to them self or others. This is what makes most humans stupid!
-10	negative	loneliness	I find it very mess up how there many schools out there how teachers make fun of disabled child.  This also happen to myself during my childhood.  Sometimes age does not matter as there people will never build decency no matter what age they are.   The adults that contribute to this can effect a child for the rest of their lives.  If I think about the life I had and many other people I know that haves disability, there not many people out there trying to make things better for people with disabilities. 
-4	negative	loneliness	I find myself at times being surrounded by people and still feeling alone. Even at home when I'm around my daughter and husband I still feel alone. I've always felt this way and it just seems like lately it has been getting worse. I try to make friends but it's hard making friends when my husband doesn't like for me to go out. Neither one of us smoke or drink and the people that I associate myself with from work that's all they do. Because of this he doesn't want me to hang out with them.  I'm just tired of feeling lonely in a crowd
-2	negative	loneliness	If Isee a spider you better take a few steps back because if you don't you are at high risk of me killing you. My arms will flail and i will probably break you neck when i latch on to you trying to get away from the spider.  
-5	negative	loneliness	If I told a single person--a single traitor to GOD and man--my secret plans it could compromise a mission that has been centuries in the making. Should I save her? Or is she working for Lucifer?
-1	negative	loneliness	if no one replies to me in 30 min im commiting suicide  !!
-1	negative	loneliness	I forgot what it's like to feel. I feel hurt and angry and sad and alone. But I forgot what it's like to feel positive emotions.  I'm so numb
-5	negative	loneliness	I found an amazing quote today and thought I would share it with you girls. I know it helped me with perspective maybe it will help some of you as well. 
-1	negative	loneliness	I found out that my crush is moving next week. I'll only be able to see her again once before she moves and I likely never see her again. 
-4	negative	loneliness	I freaking feel like my bf is not over his ex simply because I went on his fb and saw he got a message from his ex bf saying to my bf to stop liking her pictures on fb and what not he obviously denied it and I know he doesn't have her on fb so idk if this is true or not but I hate having to hear her name whether is good or bad comment about her . And idk if I should worry or not any advice ?
-2	negative	loneliness	If someone wants to become frnd with me i would like it . I'm glad to have one I like to have friends but i can't make one
-9	negative	loneliness	If there's one thing I can't stand, it's that I don't think anyone will be able to understand me. Not even my best friend who I don't even talk to anymore. I'm beginning to become very distant of my old friends because I feel like they know too much about me. And when they know too much it's like what's the point of trying to know more about me if you already know what I want you to know? Is that confusing?
-4	negative	loneliness	If you are lonely or depressed or just wanting someone to chat with or become friends with, I'm here for you.  I enjoy helping people and meeting new people. I hope to hear from you. Have a good day. 
-9	negative	loneliness	If you have feelings, guilt, or remorse, you don't have ASPD. If you want to change, there's a 99% chance you don't have ASPD. If you have any feelings towards selflessness, you don't have ASPD. Stop diagnosing yourself and talk to an actual therapist about your issues. 
-3	negative	loneliness	If you want to talk, message me. Nothing creepy though and ill try to get back to you.
-3	negative	loneliness	I gave birth to a baby girl two months ago. All the changes are overwhelming. My boyfriend works constantly, so does my parents. Five days outta week I'm alone. It's the worst feeling ever. I never felt so alone before In my life. I wouldn't trade this life but I do feel isolated and it is painful.
-5	negative	loneliness	I get blamed for a lot. my dad blames me my boyfriend blames me but when you turn the table the trigger gets pulled I just don't understand why I have to be such a bad person
-1	negative	loneliness	I get depressed alot . I always hide it in , because i wouldn't know how to describe how i feel to people . I'm just drowning , when everyone is just watching .
-6	negative	loneliness	I get so lonely sometimes. He will finally be graduating AIT in the next couple of weeks but it is still up in the air where he will be stationed :/ I think this transition is just a little harder for us since we have just gotten back together while he was in Basic after a year breakup. I just don't know what to do with myself while he is away.  Any suggestions / advice for  the times when we will be apart ? 
-1	negative	loneliness	I GET TO SEE HIM THE SECOND WEEKEND OF MARCH!!!!&lt;3 so excited!
-4	negative	loneliness	I got a phone call tonight! He's in his last week and his graduation is so close! I was surprised he called on a Monday instead of a Sunday though!
-9	negative	loneliness	I got into a miny fight with my Marine last night i comfronted him on something and i feel really bad now cause i know he has alot on his plate and he has better things go think about while hes at MOS but yeah sometimes i get really insecure and think he will find someone better or he doesnt wanna talk to me, or he will find someone better to date in the Marines..
-15	negative	loneliness	I got laid off from a really good paying job 2 plus years ago.  Unemployment ran out a while ago.  I have a meaningless parttime job that hardly pays anything.  Thank God my wife has insurance through hdr work.  I began collecting social security early after our medical expenses wiped out all our savings and my entire 401k.  We filed for bankruptecy which took care of our credit cards but because of on going medical expenses there is no money to pay the mortgage this month. We are 2 months behind on the water and electricity.  3 months behind on our 2 cars which I'm afraid could be taken away at any time now.  We need them to get to work.  Sometimes there's no money for gas and there is no mass transit where we live.  We owe all our friends who have tried to help but we just can't accept any more money from them that we can never repay. My friend days God only gives us as much as we can handle.  God if you are listening, please, no more.
-5	negative	loneliness	I got letters today!! I'm so happy. Thank all of you ladies for listening to me and helping! This site has been a blessing to me. Thank you guys again!! 
-6	negative	loneliness	I go to a college with 22,000 people so I'm almost never actually alone. I get along easily with most people and am fairly outgoing; I have a fair share of friends. Yet I feel that there is no one that I truly connect with. We have shallow conversations and I force on a smile and interest to avoid actually being alone.
-6	negative	loneliness	I go to school, and I'm always happy, or at least it seems that way. Whenever people first meet me they always say "You're always so happy," and I reply with "Yeah, I know!" As cheerfully as I can, but secretly I'm thinking, if only they knew.
-2	negative	loneliness	I gotta say, realizing that you're completely alone and it's almost entirely your fault is pretty depressing.
-10	negative	loneliness	I guess i just feel unloved. I mean the only people that love me are my family. And I'm not desperate but ive never had a boyfriend. I just want a boy to compliment me and mean it.. Not being sarcastic like most boys I know. Heaven forbid someone likes me. But I guess forever alone applies to me 
-9	negative	loneliness	I guess I'm lost right now. Not in the way some people might think, although some people first thoughts might be right. You see I'm in love. But I'm not. I'm happy. But I'm terribly scared. And I just feel so lost. Everyone feels gone now. I wish I was older. I wish I understood what it all about. What this, what life is all about. I know there's a God, I excepted him when I was younger. Now it's like I'm detached. I wish I  wasn't color blind, what's up with that, I'm going I to art college. It's not bad just some reds some blues.
-2	negative	loneliness	I guess i woudn"t mind going to school if it weren"t for lunch hours..every lunch hour i would always sit by myself since no one invites me to sit with them..i get tired of being alone wish the lunch hour was short,,
-13	negative	loneliness	I had a Best friend we were more like sisters!! We did everything together, she passed away, I lost a piece if me that day, I had nothing to say :'(     I looked around only to realize besides her I had NO real friends!! I was constantly being lied too!! So I have nobody!! I'm my bestfriend, I feel lonely, which hurts.. But ill rather be my own bestfriend than with a fake!!
-16	negative	loneliness	i had a hero. he was an amazing boy. he lived far and was a little older than me. we still talked. he saved me and i saved him. it was amazing how each others words could change everything for the better. sadly i lost him. he worried constantly about me and finally said i cant worry about you any more. i had taken over his world and he had taken over my world. even if we dont talk i dont forget him. he was my hero. i look up into the night sky sometimes and think to myself i hope all is well with him, and if he is thinking of me. 
-3	negative	loneliness	I had a seizure and collapsed in the street on my way home from work, several months ago. I managed to get up after a few minutes and get to a clinic, but I was very disoriented and had a hard time filling out the medical info form that they required.
-12	negative	loneliness	I had some cool friends in hs and I guess they did things, I guess unintentionally that  I took personally. I pushed them away. I see their group pictures on fb and it makes me sad, but I guess I gotta act like the bigger better person and like the pictures because essentially, I'm the one who pushed then away with no explication.&lt;3
-5	negative	loneliness	I had to have a lung transplant a few months back because of a rare lung disorder. Believe me, breathing air into healthy lungs and blowing it back out feels amazing!!! Walking up a flight of stairs without huffing and puffing makes me want to laugh. Seeing a group of people standing outside smoking  makes me want to throw things at them. I just don't understand why people want to ruin perfectly good lungs when they don't have to. Makes no sense to me. 
-6	negative	loneliness	I hate all my friends in high school. I don't think they understand me and i'm so frustrated. It's not  like  I can vent to someone and i feel so bad about it. I want to find people with the same interest as me and it seems like i'm asking for something impossible. I want to find people to talk with, but not because i'm sad, just talk about things we like, dreams, goals, etc I just need someone.
-2	negative	loneliness	i hate being an addict.  I keep everything bottled up inside, but I'm begging to drown in my own thoughts. I want to overcome this so bad but I'm losing hope.
-4	negative	loneliness	i hate being by myself. i have my family but it seems like my friends are drifting away and they dont care. i try to get used to it but nothing i do can really fill the void inside. i find myself crying in random places, my insides empty and hurting. i just wish i had a companion to talk to and make me feel whole
-3	negative	loneliness	I hate crying. I feel so weak and helpless and crying is something that I feel like i have no control over. Crying before bed in my opinion is awful. You just lay there, nothing to do except for think about what's hurting you and cry about it. I mean sure you'll eventually fall asleep, but it takes a lot to get to that point and when you wake up the next morning, you're still down about it. Such as if a night didnt end as according to plan. Those are the worst.
-4	negative	loneliness	I hate how I bottle up so much and then let it take the best of me. I try to talk about it but sometimes I feel like I am the only one who understands what I am going thru
-3	negative	loneliness	I hate it when I'm having a bad day and I know he could cheer me up, but he's gone and can't talk to me. But his basic graduation is coming up!
-3	negative	loneliness	I hate my job. I get humiliated there every day in front of customers by a woman who bullies me. I have no friends, no boyfriend and my family don't know how unhappy I am.
-3	negative	loneliness	I hate the fact that I care too much about people's opinion. I can't be myself because I'm scared of what they will say.  I'm trying to change but don't know how to stop caring. Why do i think people opinions so important ?!
-2	negative	loneliness	I hate the thought of being lonely but it always crosses my mind. sometimes it gets  so over whelming that i start crying. I dont choose to be lonely but then again no one chooses to be around me.
-2	negative	loneliness	I hate valentines day because all it brings to me is another day to feel lonely
-4	negative	loneliness	I hate washing dishes cuz seem like eveytime i turn around there is another dish to wash and i notice my hands feel they are so dried out..i  will put on some music now and  i guess i better go do some dishes now.
-3	negative	loneliness	I hate when people mix up to, as in "I'm going TO swim.", and too, as in "I love you TOO." Idk why it bothers me so much it just does. 
-3	negative	loneliness	I have 1 friend. I woke up suddenly and realised, I want someone to be there with me every step of the way, to chat to, to care about and to just generally be around.
-9	negative	loneliness	I have 6 sisters and 5 brothers. My 2nd oldest brother has cerebral palsy. He can t speak like me and you but we no what hes saying. His hands and legs don t work well either. He can t swollow his spit very well and carries a wash cloth to catch the extra running down his chin. Well on the way out ,in the parking lot a person come by us and told the person they were with (that some people should leave there retarded kids at home. Thats all it took. All the older kids ran to those people and started saying things to them that made them hurry to there car and leave. From that day on if any one even looked at him wrong. They had a problem on there hands because you did nt make fun of are brother. With out having us kids in your face. 
-4	negative	loneliness	I have a bit of a personal ethical dilemma and I'd like to talk to someone about it. It's something that will sound a little far fetched but I want to know what I should do at this point. 
-9	negative	loneliness	I have a divorcie two years ago. This man was a good man but he don't love me , we were friends and he always was remembering me that he don't love me like I love him but he always be present anytime I need it. He make me safe. When I decided to get the divorce I cried a lot because I feel I was lost and never have been loved.. Then I meet this man that I get crazy for him, I love him like I he was the only one. He likes to be with me but he only wants to be my friend. Sometimes I think he likes me because my money.. all this make me so sad that now I don't know what to do, I feel lost, abandon. people tell me is best to be alone but I want to experience love and to be loved. Right now Iam feel that do things like a robot, Iam so empty and trying my best to spare my time in things that I like but nothing helps. Iam tired of feel alone and cry.
-3	negative	loneliness	I have a fair bit to be rejected for, hopefully I'll find someone who will accept.
-2	negative	loneliness	I have a family and a small close group of friends, but I find it hard to talk to people I know about things I'm going through. I need someone to talk to that won't judge me or treat me differently
-2	negative	loneliness	I have a few good female friends, however is really to have a few good guy friends for advice and ti hang out with.  Girls are just too dramatic!
-2	negative	loneliness	I have a grown up daughter, but lately we hardly speak to each othershe's busy with her work and her family. I felt all alone and very2 lonelywhat can I do to fill this void?
-2	negative	loneliness	I have a lot of friends but I'm lonely. Doesn't really make sense but I just am. I guess I need like a girlfriend. I know I do but I just got out of a relationship and I wanna get back in a new one and take it seriously. I need to know my next relationship is gonna be serious I won't rush in like before. But for now I'm gonna try giving me some me time
-1	negative	loneliness	I have a lot of stories with them, Oh God they're so annoying !!
-7	negative	loneliness	I have a lot of trust issues. With all the things going on with my life right now, I feel so alone. I know I have close friends to talk to, but with my situation and all, I just can't tell them. Especially since I have a friend who's also going through depression, I want to seem strong her. To be the one she can always go to. I don't want her to end up going back to the behavioral hospital. I want her to stay and live. With my other close friends, I really do trust them, but I don't want them to pity me. I don't want to seem weak and helpless. It's just with help.. I can be a bit stubborn. Although in the end, I always end up hurting myself. In this world, I am alone.
-5	negative	loneliness	I have always felt so invisible and out of place, like no really cares. I just really need someone to talk to that will accept me for who i am and will understand what I'm going through and won't judge me for what I'm doing. Is that so wrong 
-5	negative	loneliness	I have always had trouble making friends. Being so shy had really had a negative affect on my life, and I just have nobody to talk too. I've never had a best friend that I could tell everything too, I feel like nobody knows me at all. Being alone isn't so bad, there's no drama. But sometimes I wish I could talk to someone about everything. 
-4	negative	loneliness	I have always loved this little excerpt, it says to me to honor also the darkness in my life that has made me who I am.. 
-6	negative	loneliness	I have always trouble to make friends I can't make one . I don't dare to go n talk 2 ppl n make friend I never had one. I think it's to hard but sometimes I really feel alone when I go out with my sisters or family every body goes with their friends but it's only me who sits I a corner lonely without any body.ppl thinks I'm weird n crazy . Sometimes I feel kill my self or just run away from this whole world ppl
-1	negative	loneliness	i have alwes been lonely.some times i feel so alone in the world like now one knows i even am there.i cry when i am lonely cause i feel like nobody is there to keep me company and make me happy when i feel  alone and sad.some times i get really scared being alone cause i am afraid that there is no one close i can run to when i am scared and sad and alone.
-1	negative	loneliness	I have anorexia & don't want to be cured!
-2	negative	loneliness	I have anorexic tendencies like I eat at lease one meal a day sometimes two but one times I didn't eat for 1 1/2 days and I had to go to the nurse for almost passing out at school.i made up some weird excuse so nobody would find out
-2	negative	loneliness	I have a rather difficult time at making friends. I have three but they are always leaving me out of the loop. At church, I have zero. My family doesn't exactly make it easy for me to talk to. I'm scared that if I talk to my friends they will get upset with me for bringing drama upon them and completely ignore as they have in the past. I don't have anyone to talk to and I just wish I could get away for a while so I could at least sort everything out on my own.
-3	negative	loneliness	I have battled with post natal depression with all of my kids, and it is my shame. Even the fact that I must qualify it as postnatal, shows how I try to minimize it. I always go off my meds rapidly after a few months, to attempt to feel normal, but this makes me unwell and makes matters worse. At this point I feel as though I wouldn't be able to get throughout divorce if I wasn't depressed, the numbness has been a welcome feeling. :-/
-3	negative	loneliness	I have been bullied for a while now, everyone seems to hate me. Cyber bulling is the main thing that happens in my case, all over the internet. I don't get it with these people, what's wrong with me??? I have tried suicide and cut and it's horrible, I need help!!!!
-3	negative	loneliness	I have been in a relationship only twice.  But the thing is when m I gonna find such a girl :/
-4	negative	loneliness	I have been married 45 years and I'm a male age 67. I love my wife and we are best friends but I still would like to talk to another women,just to talk. 
-17	negative	loneliness	I have been married most of my adult life but after 2 failed marriages I find myself single at 43.  I have been separated for over 3 years and during that time I have not been on 1 date.  I just have not had the nerve to ask a woman out.  Flirting and dating seem to come so easily to other guys but it feels so awkward to me.  Its strange because I am in sales and dont have any trouble selling or interacting with customers but if I am attracted to a woman or I sense that she is flirting with me I just dont know how to respond and I think I come across as aloof and that is not my intention.  I am just tired of fear controlling this area of my life yet I dont do anything to improve my situation.   Can anyone else relate?
-8	negative	loneliness	I have been married to my husband for almost 18 years in March. He was already in when we met, which was a blind date to the Marine Corps Ball. It was set up by a friend of his  and his wife that I worked with at the enlisted club on Camp Pendleton. Four months later we were married. It's had it's ups and downs, but would not change anything about our military life. He has been out since 2005, and is now in the Army Reserve, but will always consider myself a Marine wife.
-6	negative	loneliness	I have been reading your posts and I can't believe how strong you all are. I'm amazed and impressed to the core by you girls. I feel stupid for even writing it but my guy isn't deployed, he's just at AIT. But he was home for Christmas and I was so happy and we became so very close (even closer than before) so fast. He rarely left my side. Now that he's gone again I rarely sleep, and I get really depressed. I miss him more than I've ever missed somebody before. I don't want to tell him that, I know that I need to stay strong because if I don't he will come home. I understand the importance of what he is doing and he needs to finish it. But I miss him so much and every day I become a little more depressed.
-2	negative	loneliness	I have been rejected all my life for who i am ,the way i look,the shape of my body,the way I talk and it hurts
-1	negative	loneliness	I have been taken for granted by almost everybody during my life, all my life why ? is this the tax you pay for being nice ? is this my punishment for always helping ? always being able to deliver ? so please, if you have a loved person that's always there for you, don't take them for granted because it will hurt them and if you lose them they're irreplaceable.
-7	negative	loneliness	I have been taking care of a sick daughter for 22 years. I have also been the only one in the marriage that worked. My daughter just keeps having more and more problems, medically and they have done horrible things, I mean horrible things to her. She will always need these brain surgeries from time to time, we never know when and I get freaked out. I had a mental breakdown a few years ago and got better, but she had a bad summer and now I am back in the darkness. I can't live like this. I love her so much but don't know how to see her anymore as it is painful. I live with so much anxiety that it is just painful. I feel so alone and don't believe anyone can understand what this like.
-5	negative	loneliness	I have decided to walk away from the phone, from facebook, from anywhere i can find someone i know  i want to escape, no turning back, go to the country, to the mountains. live alone. get away from the people that dont want me
-4	negative	loneliness	I have dysthymia and have been depressed for as long as I can remember. Now I sort of have the same relationship as Churchill had with his , it's become my black dog. I'm not suicidal but I don't have a real urge to live either.
-3	negative	loneliness	I have experienced bully. What is the great idea of fighting bully or psychological assault? I try to practice imagining a force field around me to protect me from bullies or psychological assaults. Is that okay?
-4	negative	loneliness	I have finally realized that non-MilSO's don't understand anything that MilSO's go through. Very glad I have EP and some wonderful ladies that I've met through this or else I'd probably be going insane.
-1	negative	loneliness	I have friends But i feel so lonely. I wish i didnt feel this way but i went through this terrible breakup and my best friends keep telling me its okay but they dont know what it feels like I wish i could tell them to back away and let me deal with it but i cant because i dont want to be mean to them I dont know what i should do.. I cry myself to sleep at night and dream of my ex boyfriend.. I wish it would go away
-2	negative	loneliness	I have friends. But when Im with them I  still feel lonely . They don't know what's happening inside of my head , nobody does. I am so alone
-6	negative	loneliness	I have friends in College and plenty of money but I've never had a girlfriend, I'm surrounded by people everyday who have others but me, nothing. I started off with the "I'm fine" stuff but after almost a year I feel as if I'm at my end and I will never meet a girl. Girls where I live don't care about anything and I find them quite slutty. I have no idea why I'm posting this here
-5	negative	loneliness	I have had an extreme fear of vomiting, pretty much forever. My sister just threw up, and I am contemplating suicide if I get a stomach ache in the next few hours because I was hanging out with her yesterday.
-3	negative	loneliness	~I have had a pretend smile on my face for years. In fact I have become fairly good at convincing people I'm okay when really I feel like falling apart inside. I have been the glue for many years that holds it all together, and now truthfully I'm just tired of it all. I'm tired of pretending.~
-4	negative	loneliness	I have had a tough time this year: my grandparents died; as well as my mum splitting up from my step dad.  My parents split up when i was a baby and I have never met my dad since. At the moment I feel very lonely like I have no one but my mum to talk to.
-11	negative	loneliness	I have had emetophobia pretty much for my whole life. It has got worse since I got depression about 10 months ago, because the stress and misery has caused me to feel sick constantly. Words can't describe how terrified I am at the possibility of having to face my worst fear every day. I'm so scared that I can't even eat properly anymore thinking that anything I put in my stomach will make me sick, and I am loosing weight fast. I've been told if I don't improve my eating, I will be sent to hospital and put on a drip, which I really don't want to happen. But I am seriously struggling. Every time I look at food I just want to cry. I've hardly eaten anything over the past 3 days and feel weaker and iller than ever. I've tried counselling, and I'm even in hypnotherapy now. I'm so desperate.
-6	negative	loneliness	I have had lots of issues in my life such as medical and social issues, ( and I know ur thinking"but she's only a kid", but we go thru thing to!) but , no matter what , there is always someone who is worse off, so I tell myself to keep to myself, nobody else needs to know my problems
-15	negative	loneliness	I have had my dog Brownie since 1997. She was the best friend i ever had. I got her when i was a child and she was my first pet. I was abandoned by my mom and dad as a kid and all i had was my dog while i lived with my grandma. That dog has seen me cry, heard all my stories, and i kno she listened. She used to put her head on me when i was sad and always found a way to show me she was listening and there for me. Since she was all i had, she became my everything. I loved her more than anything in this world and i wouldve given my life for her. Brownie passed on december 13, 2012. I miss her each and every day but i thank God i got to experience the best 15 years with my baby girl. Nothing will ever compare to the love i had for her. She was and always will be my little angel, im so lost without her but i know shes in a better place now. Ill love you forever Brownie Girl
-1	negative	loneliness	I have husband and two children, have a teaching job. Life is so busy and a lot of people around, but I still feel so lonely.
-11	negative	loneliness	I have just realized how lonely I really am. I backed up into my driveway and put the car into park. I am exhausted and wanted someone to talk to and realized that I have no one to call.  I don't wanna be alone anymore, I want to have a girl I can talk to whenever I want, a girl I can have a phone call with whenever I miss her or just want someone to talk to.  - Read my featured story for a better understanding of what it is I'm looking for.
-5	negative	loneliness	I have lost everything that means anything to me in life. I have lost my beloved Amy and I am not allowed to see my children, due to a vindictive ex. I live in a world of grey but try to better myself as a person every day! And I hope and dream of being reunited with my gorgeous Amy and my awesome girls!
-8	negative	loneliness	I have made suggestions about my dark side and have talked to my close friends while experiencing it, but there is still more that I haven't shared with even them. I hope someday I can share it with them. I really want to have a few people know the whole me. But, I am nervous. What if I scare them? What if I end up getting hurt?
-4	negative	loneliness	I have never been able to speak effectively to people.  Every time I manage to make friends by some fluke, they leave me really quickly when they realize I seem to have nothing to offer them.  I don't know what's wrong with me; I always plan what to say before I see someone, but I just can't get it out.  Just seeing people intimidates me, and I don't know what to do about it.  I want to meet people who like the same things as me whom I can talk to, but I can't even talk to anyone.    I'm always alone, and I don't want to be.  
-2	negative	loneliness	I have never felt so lonely and empty in my life as I am feeling right now.
-3	negative	loneliness	I have never felt this way in my life.i always feel loved, i have never felt unloved in my life.    When I have a special person with me soon it will be amazing.   Even if we are "close friends"  its fine.  
-13	negative	loneliness	I have nobody.  The only person i dont have to fake my feelings with is my cousin, she understands and she knows the real me. When im with her all my anxious feelings go and i feel comfortable knowing ive got someone in my family that can make me feel better. But i hardly see her. Once im away from her im anxious all the time and it gets worse and worse. I dont like telling people things because theyre always happy and then theres just me constantly depressed all the time. I have suicidal thoughts every now+again i dont plan on doing anything but i dont want to be pushed to the point where i do end up trying.
-4	negative	loneliness	I have no friends. I have nobody to talk to. Nobody to keep me company. No one is ever here to cheer me up or make me feel like I mean something. My life is pretty depressing and boring and I'm pretty tired of how it's been the past 23 years.
-4	negative	loneliness	I have no friends. I have no one to talk to. I'm lonely with my surroundings to. I left my home town to go to boarding school. At least I left my step dad behind.
-1	negative	loneliness	I have no friends that I can talk with. My family doesn't understand. I need a friend to text and vent to. Message me and we can share numbers. Thank you.
-1	negative	loneliness	i have no good friends in my college.i don't like to go to college since there is no one to share my feelings with..i am lonely in my college..  
-6	negative	loneliness	I have no life. None whatsoever. I mean I do nothing all day. The best thing that done happened to me this week is that my tatter tots were hot at lunch. I mean NO life. It's so sad it has to be like that but oh well. Things will get better.
-2	negative	loneliness	I have no one and no where to go. Loneliness is destroying me. 
-4	negative	loneliness	I have no onei lost all my friends, everyday my mom yells at me and i have to do everything for her, i take care of her 3 other kids and get disrespected, my boyfriend is supposed to love me and always be there for me, but hes not.hes never here for mei need someone to talk to
-1	negative	loneliness	I have no one to talk to :/ feel left out 
-11	negative	loneliness	I haven't been on lately.  Things have been pretty crazy and I have not a lot of time to myself.  I have been reading more to keep myself from thinking to much.  Well that doesn't seem to be helping now either.  I don't really have anyone to talk to.  I thought I had friends, but now I am not so sure.  Things have just changed so much and I don't know what to do anymore.  My mind is running away from me again.  I just start crying or on the brink of crying most of the time.  I have been starting to feel like I am having panic attacks and I know that is not good.  I thought I had people there for me but it turns out I don't know who trust anymore.  I have trust issues and I probably always will.  When I think I find a friend I know it's not for to long because they never stick around. =/
-1	negative	loneliness	I haven't had a single friend for the past five years.Thought about suicide so I can feel better. Anyone has any advice?

-7	negative	loneliness	I have one friend whom I know for the past 6 months. We clicked and get close pretty fast, hanging out and talking like a close friend. She personally had one bestfriend whom she knew for more than 4 years, which I respect their bestfriend relationship on the first place and I know no one can replace her from my friend's heart. Thank you so much

-4	negative	loneliness	I have parents and two siblings living on the other side of the planet. I have a beautiful wife since 5 years. I have a job with colleagues with whom I joke around and chat. I have friends, albeit we don't meet very often any more due to work and/or relationships being in the way. I have all this, and I still feel lonely most of the time. Problems of the privileged indeed
-2	negative	loneliness	I have plans to finally get married as it's almost time for me to settle down soon.. why????
-7	negative	loneliness	I have recently had a set back since my ex came back. I still love him and there is a possibility that I might be pregnant. Now, the man that I had a crush on is now interested in me and is starting to do all things my ex never did. I want to move forward but I am not sure if I should. This confusion has left me feeling lonely. Im always alone.
-3	negative	loneliness	I have relationship problems. I am like half way around the world from her and I never cried so much. :'|

-5	negative	loneliness	I have this anxiety disorder for a couple of months now. Occasionally I feel I need to breathe in deeply. Cant get used to it. Im trying to be a bit more stronger and convince myself its nothing. Still Im thankful that is goes away but I pray that it doesnt come back again anymore.
-7	negative	loneliness	I have this idea I'm my head about leaving. It's so vivid I can definitely see it happening. I see me and a friend or two, driving in my car to California. Music loud. Being wild. Barely any money. Feeling the breeze with the windows down. Barely any clothes. Just driving and driving, enjoying the feeling of being free. I don't care about money or taxes or jobs the hipster life seems just right for me. I want to do what I please. I can't wait until the day I get in my car and look over to my friends and say "Let drive!" I'm going to be gone 'Into the wild' is the perfect movie example of what I want to do.
-1	negative	loneliness	I have thought about killing my self
-2	negative	loneliness	I have trouble making friends.  Mostly I think if they know me they might not like the real me
-1	negative	loneliness	I have two living children now.  Jason is healthy, and growing up.  Sasha is mentally ill, and stuck in place. It hurts to realize that I'll never see that beautiful smile again.
-7	negative	loneliness	I have two sons. One died at age 18 in 2005 in a car accident. My other son is 22, university graduate living and working in Manhattan.  My husband has 2 daughters, 14 and 17 with 2 different mothers.  My ex died in 2006. My husband never married first mother and she is a narcissist and has tried every parental alienation trick in the book making it difficult to have a functional relationship with the 17 year old.  We have persevered through it and maintained constant presence in her life despite the extreme obstacles thrown at us constantly. We are friendly with the 14 yr old's Mom and socialize with her and her husband and  their other daughter. Oh we'll, being honest!
-3	negative	loneliness	I have wandering minds today and just want to talk. If you're cool and won't just message with hi or offer to show me your pics or ask if I am "bald" or say stupid things, message me. 
-8	negative	loneliness	I have what may sound like a stupid question My soldier graduates AIT on February 11th. I'm wondering if people usually go to that graduation? I know his family won't be going and although I would miss a week of school I feel like somebody should be there if people do go to that. I really wish that I didn't have school because I'm not sure if I'm going to go or not but just in case I decide to Any idea?
-6	negative	loneliness	I hide who I am from everybody. I've always been that way. It's just so hard to show the real me. But each day I get closer and closer to doing so. I want to share myself, the real me but not just with anybody. I cannot and will not put myself out there to be hurt. I'm so lonely though and nobody understands or cares. I just want to feel. ALIVE for once in my life. I'd give anything.
-4	negative	loneliness	I hold on so much to the good times that when I look back, I felt that time has left me behind and then I feel so sad.. why do things change? 
-2	negative	loneliness	i honestly get bored of everyone. i'm going to die alone. 
-1	negative	loneliness	I honestly haven't felt as lonely as I do right now. I don't feel like I have anybody to turn to. My life is a huge mess, and everything seems to be going wrong. I'm sorry for my little rant guys. I just have all these stupid feelings bottled up inside me, and I honestly don't feel like I can talk to any of my friends about them.
-4	negative	loneliness	I honestly like being alone, thinking to myself with do distractions, no noises, and no problems, because I'm in my own little world. When I'm like this I'm free Free from everyone and everything. Just, FREE.
-11	negative	loneliness	I honestly loved the girl i lasted dated. i did nothing but show her my love. i even got her friend and her back together that she met over Skype(This friend is a guy she met over Skype and never see's). I never went to far and i was completely honest with her, I did get kinda mad when she talked to that guy she met over Skype but the reasonable, right? after she broke up with me i just completely sad and mad and kept blaming myself. I don't think i could ever meet a girl like her ever again.
-12	negative	loneliness	I joined the Navy to get away from home and have my liberty and iMagine all these great things, but it's been completely the opposite. I've never been so lonely in my life before. I try to find the ways to look at things positively, but at the end of the day I look to my left and no one is there. I look to my right and it's just my shadow. Meanwhile everyone at home is sad that I'm gone and I'm in the same way. All because I was thinking about my self the whole time. And now I have mother and a father crying for their Son, and two brothers and a sister trying to find their ways with out my presence. Sometimes I feel like they talk about like if passed away and treasure everything I once touch back at home.
-2	negative	loneliness	I just asked a Girl out to the movies now I'm just waiting for the inevitable reply
-1	negative	loneliness	I just broke up with my boyfriend and I need someone to help get it off my mind.
-2	negative	loneliness	I just don't get why today started off so good than everyone is like leave me alone I'm so annoyed. It's like instantly also maybe it effects me so much cause I'm a very emotional and sensitive person and other propels moods effect me? Should I ignore it or act upon it
-1	negative	loneliness	I just don't understand fully what to truly believe can help me, so mostly on a religious stand poi.t, is where I'm at, but, I just feel lime a deer in the headlights, I don't know what to do, or how. But I have felt better as I've spent more time with friends and family, and talking about this with them, I am slowing coming back. 
-10	negative	loneliness	I just entered my first year of uni in the fall, and this is the first time I've ever been so far from home. All my friends and every person from my high school stayed near home. I thought it's be easy, making new friends, keeping good grades  I was usually alone anyway, after school, before school, I have become used to it, but here I am always alone but I've never felt more lonely.
-5	negative	loneliness	I just feel like life is this very long chore that will never end. Iv started to just want to sleep 24/7. Nothing I do really brings me much enjoyment. I believe it's because of how alone I feel. Living off campus for your first year of college doesn't help when it comes to making friends. Now regardless of how much I dislike life I have no intention of ending it. I just wish I could enjoy myself and be happy again
-2	negative	loneliness	I just feel so lonely at times I know it sounds like a clich but when I'm in a room full of people whether it's my family or my friends or at work I just feel like the only person there. Anybody else ever have this feeling.

-16	negative	loneliness	i just got off the phone with my sailor, and tonight i was seriously reminded of how incredibly important i am in my mans life. im his everything, the person who is always there for him, the one connection he has to home and the one who has constantly supported him since he left last march. today was a really hard day for him, some confusion with his new training command and long story short he got yelled at for about two hours so loud that the people mustering outside could hear. and although my man isnt one to cry or breakdown or be upset i could hear it in his voice that he was just so burnt out and so down. he needed me, he always needs me. hearing him say that it meant the world to him that i was there to always make him smile and stay by his side was just such an amazing feeling.  
-1	negative	loneliness	I just got off work and I have nobody to talk to. I feel like I'm going crazy. I need someone to chat with..

I someone to care about me. Is that to much to ask
-1	negative	loneliness	I just want someone to have a normal conversation with me. Not a boring one but not one where the other person is so a fraud to break me. I am not fragile. I want someone who relates to me to just talk to me without waiting for me to break.
-1	negative	loneliness	I just want someone to love me 
-1	negative	loneliness	I just want someone to run their fingers through my hair.
-1	negative	loneliness	i just want someone to talk to                                                  to ask me about my day
-5	negative	loneliness	I just want someone to talk to. I don't want to feel this feeling of emptiness. I want to hear about your day or how your doing what you like to do.  I lost all my friends due to my severe anxiety. I distance myself from people even my own family. I'm so quite that I feel people sometimes forget I'm there.
-1	negative	loneliness	I just want someone to talk to me a lot and actually care instead of talking to me and leaving.
-2	negative	loneliness	I just want someone to talk to who has been in my shoes. I just need some support and some advice. I'm so scared I'm going to lose him. 
-2	negative	loneliness	I just want to be loved forever and taken care of. It's crazy how many feelings I have in this little body. Imagine being completely infatuated with someone you have never met; I'm tired of feeling alone.
-1	negative	loneliness	I just want to explode into the world. I must release it now or forever hold it to destroy.

-2	negative	loneliness	I just want to put this up here that I am always looking for people to talk with, and make new friends 
-5	negative	loneliness	I just want to talk to someone. It's not that I'm depressed, or have to get something off my chest; I just want to have a pleasant conversation with someone new. I would love to have some intelligent conversation, but I would be comfortable talking to most people about whatever they want.
-3	negative	loneliness	I just want to talk to someone, someone that isn't "normal". I'm sick of what society considers normal, and the standard and criteria that you have to meet in order to "fit in". Does anyone else feel like they don't belong anywhere? 
-6	negative	loneliness	I just want to tell all of you girls to stay strong and stand by your men. Don't give up hope! We can't always talk to them or see them when we want. And that causes our mind to question a relationship. But the first message you get from them, the first letter, the first call, it all brings back those loving feelings. Just hang in there and know you're not alone. We can do this! Best wishes! 
-1	negative	loneliness	I just went through the worlds worst breakup. When I'm with my friends having fun I'm fine but with every single day so far you always come back to that point when your alone and you know you can't reach out to that one person anymore what do you do.. Every night I lay down I wanna cry he is gone he's not there anymore
-1	negative	loneliness	I just won't someone to have a good long convo with mainly so I could lessen to them. I like to lessen!
-1	negative	loneliness	I kind of like it. Loneliness can sometimes be a good thing, i certainly feel it is. If i wanted to surround myself around people, i would. To learn about yourself, you have to be alone to do it.
-18	negative	loneliness	I  knew this would happen, I knew everyone I cared about would abandon me and leave me to die. I feel like I have no one. No friends to talk to. No family to that cares. All my friends seem to exist in my head. If you shoo me away where do I go. Who do I have besides myself. If you don't want to be there for me I'm left alone. You all probably wouldn't care less if I died. You wouldn't shed a tear, you wouldn't even feel bad.in the back of your head you would say, he made his choice but is that all true? Do you think the reason I killed myself is because you pushed me away? You didn't try to get help me..I can tell you I'm a different person than most. I tend to think about other people before myself even if my problems are destroying me I will still put you first. :-( how can you do this too me. You hurt me deeply. I have no heart left to give You broke it!!! :'( I'll go cry now since you don't care about me.
-6	negative	loneliness	I know christmas is a happy time but last night (Christmas Day) I saw photos of mates with their girlfriends or boyfriends and I just cried myself to sleep that night because know one loves me like that ;-(
-2	negative	loneliness	I know he's almost home but I miss him so much today!!!! I'm crazy lost without him I want my husband!!!!! I guess I just need a pep talk.
-1	negative	loneliness	I know he used me, but I can't help but love him. 
-2	negative	loneliness	I know I do a lot of complaining about the waiting and all the not talking, but let me just say I love my man!! So blessed to have him. 
-2	negative	loneliness	I know that one day I won't have to pretend. It keeps me going knowing that one day I won't be hurting anymore. It can't be like this forever.
-2	negative	loneliness	I know that there is someone out there in this world who's exactly like me ))
-1	negative	loneliness	I know the feeling.. Hiding the tears and putting on that brave face when really inside your hurting..
-8	negative	loneliness	I know this is not dating site, but I really want to talk face to face with some one. I am asian guy, height 5'5". Currently, I am living in Oulu, Finland where it is really cold and dark. Thus, I am feeling lonely. I would like to talk to someone over 21 years old. If you are also down by the weather, please msg me.
-3	negative	loneliness	I know this is probably the wrong one to look in but I'm looking for a daddy. One to be a father figure in my life. I really would like a dad
-4	negative	loneliness	I know this sounds a little bit mental with my boyfriend already been in the navy and i miss him every day, but i want to join the army. The thing is i have had wanted to for a while but never struck up the courage to do it. At the same time though its an awful thought of having to go through boot camp without Danny again, also i could be based closer than what i am now! I just don't know! Would it delay us settling down? Grrrrr i need some advice! obviously my friends and family don't want me to so they are more for me not going. Has anyone got any advice on what you think should do?! It would really be appreciated.
-1	negative	loneliness	I lay alone while my mind wonders why am I so alone. Alone is the only thing about me, I am the only one her, never to be seen, never to be loved, never to be held and kissed. I am nothing to this existence, nothing for me here.
-1	negative	loneliness	I lay here under the covers so the light from my phone doesn't wake him.  I wish he would realize that all I need is for him to put his arms around me and tell me everything is going to be ok.
-19	negative	loneliness	I lied to everyone and could convince everyone I had it, easily. I have manipulated everyone in my life and felt strong because of it. I was getting what I needed. I never even felt bad until I found someone that I love. I have physically hurt people on purposechoked themand much more. I can mimic anything and most of what I am is just that, a mimic of moments i've seen. I can talk most people into anything. I have exploited every weakness and manipulated even myself into thinking everyone is like this buti am realizing that they are not. I still don't actually "feel" bad. I know these things about myself 
-1	negative	loneliness	I lie in bed, having so much ideas to share, and yet there is no one to listen. Most of the time, I play games. But it leaves me empty. The numerous thoughts in my head won't stop. I need someone to listen.
-10	negative	loneliness	I like creative writing (no effort put into this at all, please feel free to carry kn the story i just wanna see how far this goes and how the story turns without my control) A boy wonders deep in the forest just before the sun goes down. Trees as tall as sky scrapers, noises screeching from beyond, eyes glowing in the thick of bushes. All he could think is "I bet I'm the next meal of this place" never has he been here before. Passing tree to tree he looks down and notices human bones just peaking through the dirt. Blood lays on the edges of the tall trees. He closes his eyes and thinks to himself "should I keep walking or turn now"
-13	negative	loneliness	I like my brother friend alot and not sure if he does back.My brother friend is the coach with boys baseball games and give me eye connection. At one point he was standing on the side of the room seen him giving me eye connection .He left for college for only 3 months the day after he snapchat the team with a pic of a ring and said what am I spotes to do with this? Than today he took video send everyone I have no valtime this year with him in candysection .Ond day I was having issues with this guy on fb so he comments back say he dont know how to treat a woman and needs to get his priority straight and to leave his family alone
-17	negative	loneliness	I like this guy, he is everything I look for in an guy. Even though I am only a teen I think  I know if it is love, it feels different sort of feeling this time, I only see him twice a week since we only see each other at cadets.  After half an hour of contemplating I decided I should. I chose to say it on the right subject (how close we are). So I told him and he said nothing. By that time, we were 15 minutes away from the squadron. I'm seeing him tomorrow night for another parade night and I feel as if it came to a shock to him but I really like him and me and Andy have so much in common. 
-3	negative	loneliness	I like to be distant away from my family. Seems like I can only get enough silence to think in my room. It's good to hear my own voice every once in awhile.
-2	negative	loneliness	I like to have cute convos xx ))  Plz talk to me I'm not too unbearable
-1	negative	loneliness	i like to meet other people and talk a lot somessage me
-1	negative	loneliness	I like to think about all kinds of things.
-9	negative	loneliness	I live in a marriage that is more like a cage than anything else. I am watched every action. I make I scrutinized. My parents raised a very independent take charge kind of person and now, I am nothing more than a child to my husband. I am given an allowance and only allowed out of the house when I am with him or when I have to go to the doctor. I feel neglected of love, compassion, and respect.
-3	negative	loneliness	I live n a 3 story house, City of Angels, my house is over 100 yrs. old, if the walls could talk!!!
-2	negative	loneliness	I'll talk to you if you need a listener  so yeah shoot me a mesage 
-1	negative	loneliness	I long to be wanted and needed, to be missed and being in someones mind when Im not around. I want to give myself away to someone who is willing to do the same for me. I want to be tangled up in a bond that no distance, no time and no doubt can break. A beacon pointing towards the better days.
-2	negative	loneliness	I look at what they have written and I can't read it. It reminds me of custom license plates and trying to decipher those. I just can't read most of then easily. So, I say grow up and learn proper English. 
-6	negative	loneliness	I lost all my friends when i dropped out of high school. I didn't keep in touch with them but 1. We were best friends for 5 years but stopped being friends with me because of her boyfriend.  Im sad now because All i needed was at least 1 friend . I treated her like my my own sister.  But she left me for her 300+ facebook friends and her boyfriend  I guess i wasn't enough.
-4	negative	loneliness	I lost everything in my life I lost everyone Even my dream too There is nothing left for me in this world God is waiting for me I wanna be disappear in stars
-1	negative	loneliness	I lost my 18 year old son, Andrew, on October 16, 2010.  
-15	negative	loneliness	I lost my daughter at 39 weeks. It was on a Tuesday September 17th, 2013 I didn't feel her move, I called my doctors office around 5:00 pm. They told me to drink something sugary and lay on my left side for an hour, and if I didn't feel 5 kick to go to labor & delivery. I never felt those movements, I went to the hospital and they couldn't find her heartbeat. I had Layla on the 19, she was perfect 7Ibs 2oz 21in. It breaks my heart just thinking about it. I know she's in a good place now but I still wish she was here with me, this is the first time a baby was born sleeping in my family. I may only be 18 but she's still my child & I love her dearly. People say I'm a strong young women, but I don't feel strong I feel like the weakest person in the world. My heart hurts everyday, I just want to know how some of you got through this, some days I feel like I can't continue through this because of the pain. It makes me not want to try for another child in the future. 
-19	negative	loneliness	I lost my first born baby girl May 31 2007 I named her Hailey Nicole I didn't think I could ever get over loosing her She was born at 6.25 a.m I was 29 weeks pregnant and I was excited I was happy but my ex husband wasn't he didn't want to be father but that didn't change my mind I wanted to be a mother but I guess God had different plans for my baby girl he needed an angel I grieved for a long time but finally I came to terms with what had happened. Although doctors told me I wouldn't be able to carry children to term but I guess I proved them wrong  I have Two beautiful babies now. I still think of what she would be like what she would look like and I miss her but I know she is my angel. I know I'll see her again some day..
-21	negative	loneliness	I  lost my first child do to stillbirth. I got pregnant in May,2010 and was due in Feb2011 normal pregnancy ,no health issues. We found out we were having a baby girl  in August,2010. From there on every was going great. We were so happy. We gave her the name Khristain naming her after a relative that passed away the previous December. We had a baby shower in November,2010. A bit early I was 7months but I didnt want to have it in december,January ,February because the weather is pretty bad here during those months. So anyway the night before I went in I was talking and singing to my baby girl. & she seemed fine moving like always. The next morning I woke up ate breakfast and went in for my 8th month appt, my boyfriend had to work so I went alone. I notice she didnt respond like she normally would after I ate, I told my dr she said don't worry she might be sleeping still.

I love hearing stories of my great great grandmother, she was so beautiful she was stolen from our tribe (she was returned), I love having native blood in my veins. It makes me feel so beautiful. I love embracing everything I'm mixed with &lt;3

-20	negative	loneliness	I love living in a small town where if you talk to one guy they all talk to each other. I thought after high school this would change but no luck. I just started talking to this one guy who was friends with guys who went to my high school and he asked me to basically come over and hook up. I politely declined and he stopped texting me. I texted him today after three days of no communication and he gave me short answers and made me feel like I was a bother. I said goodbye and go on Instagram to see he had posted a picture with all the guys from high school we knew mutually. I knew they had probably talked about me since one of them was also turned down by me, another broke my heart, and the rest only knew me as far as what rumors and gossip went around. Another day in a small town with small minded people especially men.
-11	negative	loneliness	I love my boyfriend dearly and were nearing our one year anniversary soon. I knew that being in a relationship with someone whose in the army wasn't going to be easy, but he's worth it all tome. Now we're at one of those difficult times I'm sure many military coupled go through. He's leaving for his duty station soon and its about 5 states away. He asked me to move down there and I was a little hesitant at first because I'm still in college, but agreed to and decided I would look at colleges in the surrounding area. Recently though he told me that I shouldn't move down there and change my life plans just so we can be together, that we can still do the long distance this until we just cant anymore. I was a little hurt by this, thinking that he didn't want to be with me like that or something, but I think he just wants to make sure I don't give up anything for him. I just feel a little bit down since he has his whole life planned out and I'm just living day by day.
-8	negative	loneliness	I love my job, I love my home and boyfriend. But there are days when it the end of the work day that I'm torn between not wanting to go home and not wanting to stay at work. I don't know what causes this feeling and it's gotten better. But there were a few weeks when he first moved in that I felt like this every day. It wasn't necessarily because he moved in because it was good for me to have him there and for me to not spend so much time alone. But all I wanted was to be left alone.  The story goes a little deeper but this is all I'll say for now.
-9	negative	loneliness	I love my solider. I miss him dearly and every day grow prouder of him. I write him every day just to tell him I love him or I'm thinking about him. My job is to support him. I take care of myself first, but he is never far from that. Keep going MilSOs. It'll work out.
-2	negative	loneliness	I love the Marine Corps, I do. But I hate this feeling! My Marine is in MCT right now. He started on the 14th and I just don't know when to expect to hear from him again. Anyone else have any input on this? I have some HUGE news for him (I'm also enlisting) and I wanna talk to him but I don't know how long that'll be. And of course I just miss him  What was your MCT experience?
-3	negative	loneliness	I love to be surrounded by people I love and every time I see my self alone in the house by myself I feel sad inside. I like to share my opinion with others if they seem interested
-6	negative	loneliness	I'm 13 and i'm 5'5 I'm currently in 7th, I'm Latina and most Latinos are known for being short. Anyway, most people in my grade are in the 4's-5'3s. I feel so huge and uncomfortable. I just wish i was short . And everywhere i go i seem to be taller than everyone else. 
-9	negative	loneliness	I'm 13.. My mom is being abusive and mean to me. She takes everything from me. She thinks I'm doing bad thing witch I'm not! I'm at my breaking point. She scared away my bestfriend.. That was who helped me with everything. I just need someone to talk to or help me figure out something for me to do
-6	negative	loneliness	I'm 14, just moved to Florida. Went to freshman year for about 2 months, hated it. Now I have no real life friends lol For some reason I tend to push people out of my life, I have no idea why lol
-12	negative	loneliness	I'm 16 . I have " friends " and in that girl at school people see as the one his never lonely . Always having fun , never sad , never cries. They put this image of me in their minds & I feel I have I be that person , so I am . To them and at school at least . But being that girl gets lonely .. You have so many people that surround themselves around you but , than again you have nobody . Most of them don't know I have A's & B's . Or that I plan to go to college . I'm just that " pretty girl " .. That's all I am to them . A trophy .,
-7	negative	loneliness	I'm 35 and I am still not sure who I am going to be when I grow up. If you had asked me when I was a child or a teenager, I had goals and dreams. Things in life have taken me off that path and now I feel like I just exist, take up space, with no real purpose.
-4	negative	loneliness	I'm 62, married to my childhood sweetie soon to be 44 years.  Wow, it just went so fast.  I am happy most of the time, have my ups and downs just like anyone else.  I would like to connect with others in my age bracket but in no way averse to connecting with others younger or older.  Life is about learning and sharing, making connections -  no matter age or anything else really.  Looking forward to getting to know people on EP. 
-1	negative	loneliness	Im a 16 girl, alone sad depressed, i hate it, i want everything to stop, just get out of this world, no one likes me, i have no friends, not in a relationship, get bullied, i hate myself
-2	negative	loneliness	I'm a 17 year old, currently studying at college. I don't have it bad, but I just wonder, what is the point anything? I've always been like that since 13. I've never cut myself, I'm terrible with women. I used to get bullied back at school but I feel as If i've become stronger because of this but  now, now i'm depressed Sigh. 
-2	negative	loneliness	I'm a 24 girl, going to be a wife so soon to the love of my life but too scared from the whole story! My father died when I was 16 I feel so lonely and embarrassed to not have my dad by side ! And I'm not sure if my family will support me at this day as mother and sister will do.. Also my hubby to be family's think that's I've the sweets family in the world!
-3	negative	loneliness	I'm a big people person; social events and being around people gives me energy. But sometimes, I like to go into my room, dim the lights, put on my music, and have a conversation with my heart 
-6	negative	loneliness	Im about to give up. My life keeps flipping every day and i have no one. Ive been abused and bullied. I dont love my family anymore, the only person i love thinks its a joke. Ive always thought things will get better but they only get worse. I have nightmares every night, and I dont know what 2 do. I need someone to trust really bad I have nothing anymore):
-2	negative	loneliness	I'm actually very quiet and reserved I'd rather answer questions than ask I'm not good on giving advise but I'm a good listener I tend to not talk to people in person I'm a loner / wallsflower but I wanna open up more I'm not shy theoretically just very reserved :/ just wanted to say some things about me!
-4	negative	loneliness	I made a mistake but i love him,sometimes we do bad things without controlling ourselves,the result is being lonely I was lonely before you but after i had you you became my everything as you are the smile on my face and the hapiness inside my heart ,you are the sadness of my eyes ..i belong to you ..and i will always pray to come back for me
-3	negative	loneliness	I made the decision to break up lastnight with my live in boyfriend of 1 year.  Tell me its completely normal to be sure of your decision and then start remembering the good times, feel regret, anxiety etc? This has to pass?! A different emotion floods through me every minute.
-5	negative	loneliness	I'm afraid that if I try to help someone of if I try to open up that someone will tell me too shut up or that I'm a drama queen.
-3	negative	loneliness	I'm a good listener and I like to talk and have deep conversation. If you are in need of someone to talk to, feel free to hit me up  because bored.
-5	negative	loneliness	I'm a little underweight and lacking vitamins and stuff, but only by a little bit. My doc says that I can take food supplements to help a little bit, but I don't have to, since my lack of vitamins is so small that it won't really affect anything, and it'll be alright as soon as my weight is alright. But to my mum, anything the doc suggests, even if he says I don't have to, becomes compulsory. She bugs me all the time after I have dinner to take a tablet, and it's so annoying. It tastes horrible and I hate swallowing tablets with water. And I hate when I'm just a little ill - like a 24 hour cold, and my mum keeps insisting that I have paracetamol. Even though I have syrup paracetamol, it tastes rancid. Ewww @.@
-6	negative	loneliness	I'm alone all the time. Already fifteen years till I've got ill with Multiple Sclerosis. My wife left me and took away our baby. At first I was sad but then I've got used and now I feel OK. Now I seeking loners like me to share experience living alone. Sometimes I think: others are just can't understand how to be all the time together only with yourself. All the people around has their own lives where is no place for me. Sorry for my terrible English it not my native language.
-2	negative	loneliness	I'm alone.I have a big family.They don't care about me.My parents often yell at me for no reason.I don't have real(good) friends.This hurts a lot.
-3	negative	loneliness	I'm alone in my life. my family has rejected me all my life and I can't feel okay to meet people and allow them to like me because I've never known what it's like to have ever been accepted by anyone. it's been such a terrible life and all I can be is angry and hurt all the time.
-2	negative	loneliness	I'm a loner in rl, I prefer to be left alone and not talked to. On the internet I'm totally different, I don't really know why but I just am.
-2	negative	loneliness	I'm a loner. More importantly, I'm a loner by choice. It's largely because of my issues with depression, because I don't want to die one day and hurt a lot of people; I'd rather kill myself and only hurt a few people, if I can help it, so this is the choice that I made.
-2	negative	loneliness	I'm alright as long as I keep myself distracted, which for the most part I am good at.If I let loneliness gets it's foot in the door I'm pretty much a goner, and it feels like someone's wrapped butcher's twine around my heart and lungs. You can't move or think, ya just sit there with a grimace on your face like you just slammed your fingers in a car door. 
-3	negative	loneliness	i m also alone in my house. since last 4 yrs i m not celebrating neither x-mas nor new year. my family lives in foreign country and because of studies i m unable to visit. sincerely looking for a friend whom with i can talk, share happiness and sorrow. feeling lonely. 
-3	negative	loneliness	I'm always alone. I feel like all of my problems are pathetic. Being alone has been the new normal the past two years of my life, I sit and watch all my friends be happy and find love waiting for mine but it never has come. Will it ever? Chances are looking slim. I'm trying so hard to be happy but it seems nearly impossible. I can't talk to anyone when I'm feeling low, I only have one sibling that doesn't understand my parent think my problems are a waste and I don't want to feel like a bother to my friends and put a damper on there unhappiness with mine. I'm just tired of my life.
-13	negative	loneliness	I'm always here for anybody who needs someone to talk to. I'm a great listener. If you're depressed or going through a tough time and just need someone to listen to you, that's what I'm here for. If you'd like a friend that's always here for you all you have to do is message me or just comment here and I'll without a doubt respond to your message. I look forward to talking with you soon  Have a good day.
-5	negative	loneliness	Im always online  , im always looking for new people to  talk with and learn from . To be honest my life is pretty boring , even now all im doing is watching  bear grills .    it would be really nice if i could have some more people to talk to or with about things  we have both been through lol.
-1	negative	loneliness	Im always there for everyone. Through my friends' depression, heard all of their stories, listened, helped. I'm going through some of the hardest times in my life and i have nobody. I'm so depressed.
-1	negative	loneliness	I'm always up for a good chat
-10	negative	loneliness	I'm am simply terrafide of being rejected or made fun of! Its not just because i'm a little different, i have never been good with people. So i try to avoid them most of the time. I guess somewhere in trying to keep my heart safe i became shy. But i'm tired of hiding now and want my old opinion back. She if anyone has some advise on being more straight with people and more confident i will gladly hear it.  There is probably a lot more to this but this is what i can say for sure.
-3	negative	loneliness	I'm a noob in love (T_T) I gotta accept it.
-3	negative	loneliness	Im a rare type of loner that don't depend on people to make me happy instead I like to depend on things.I learned long ago you just cant depend on people they come and go wonder if any other loner on this site like me its a lot of fake loners on this site I noticed. 
-2	negative	loneliness	I'm a really shy person, and I could really use talking to more people, but I'm too shy to start conversations. Could you please talk to me? You won't regret getting to know me.
-3	negative	loneliness	I'm a senior in high school and I feel like everyone around me knows what they want for the next 5 years of their life. Where they're going to college what they want to major in.  -Andrea
-10	negative	loneliness	I'm at my breaken point of grief,and with this in my mind, i'll write. ABANDONED, this is the most important time where your love one come in play,this is were i have their support, they will help you feel your not alone.walk in my shoes, i'm alone. so the closes thing to me is my god, my church now my grief concealers, you know that expression, work it and it will work for you, well thats what i have to do, the worst of the most, when you cry for your self, this the most trying time, this is when mental illness can take over, the deep depression, i can hear my self keep saying i'm fighting for my life, sounds like depression. i went throught this in my early stages, but this time for my self, so i have to catch my self for my recovery,  page86
-2	negative	loneliness	I'm at work and am pretty bored right now  any women want to msg here or chat in FB ? 
-2	negative	loneliness	Im away with my parents for the weekend.  It makes me just want to come home =
-5	negative	loneliness	I'm a weird person if i do say so myself. I'm into things that most people aren't and I'm rejected because I don't conform with the world around me like other people do, I just want acceptance
-7	negative	loneliness	I'm a weird person. I'm too nice and strange. I've never really had friends. Ive always just been a loner. I've always wanted a friend or two that cared about me and that wanted to hang out with me all the time, and we'd grow old together and gossip and whatnot but that never happened and probably never will. I wish there were more loyal friends out there
-6	negative	loneliness	I'm a woman that dates women. I am proud of my sexuality. Ok so i have been talking to this woman for about two months now n we had chemistry from the start but it's hard for her to show me how she really feel she tell me everything but her actions doesn't match her words I don't know if it's because she has been hurt in the past or is she really into me. I'm confused.
-2	negative	loneliness	I May Be Not The One You Dreamed You're The One I Love "The Most"..

-3	negative	loneliness	I'm becoming content with being alone. I know what that means but I think at this point I can't stop it.
-14	negative	loneliness	I'm beyond stressed out. I'm suppose to pick a college by the end of this school year. I'm only a sophomore tho! I've been calling all these coaches because I have to know which college to go too. I play a sport that's why it's so early and these colleges want me but it's so stressful! And dealing with school too is just the worst. Also I dated this boy for a year and we broke up a couple months ago but he's come back into my life as a friend and it's hard to talk to him as a friend. But then there's this guy who likes me and I could like him but he does things I don't respect. He said he's changed but I don't want to like him and I just need someone to talk to that doesn't know who I am or my story. I just need a good conversation with a stranger & to also help me.
-2	negative	loneliness	I'm board some one should text me
-3	negative	loneliness	I'm bored and want someone to talk to! I'm a 17 year old guy, and I like girly conversations  I think I'm pretty easy to talk to too

-1	negative	loneliness	I'm broken and hurt  I don't have anyone else to talk to  because I have lost that person when I fell Inlove with him
-5	negative	loneliness	I'm coming to terms with the fact that my sibling is a drug addict but I'm struggling with this information. My husband has also taken a new job and is severely underpaid so we have financial concerns. He doesnt want to talk about these issues and I feel a need to.
-7	negative	loneliness	I'm conflicted. Not just about one thing about everything and some days my head hurts cus of it or I have a panic attack because of it. I really have no friends in school, maybe cus I'm failing school. I have a bad diet and I feel like the most dull witted person ever. Right now I just need someone to tell me where to go with my life, which isn't what i should be asking for. Where do I go with my life

-8	negative	loneliness	I'm doing my exams next Tuesday, but nothing will sink into my mind whenever I try to revise. I have to do good in my exams because I want to move to another school! I will probably do bad but I hate the school I'm at! does anyone have any good tips on how I could revise better?
-7	negative	loneliness	I'm driving myself mad, I'm going back to college tomorrow after two months off for Christmas break and I'm dreading it. I live 2 hours away but I get extremely homesick. And it's not an option for me to go home whenever I want because it's too much hassle. I just can't stop thinking. Thinking about the panic attacks to come when I'm sitting in my room alone in college. I haven't made much friends there so I don't feel happy. I feel lonely. Scared. Anxious. Depressed. I want so bad to feel ok but im just finding it too difficult. Please someone with experience help me. Does it get easier? Or will I always be dreading going back??
-8	negative	loneliness	I'm eating lunch by myself. I took my lunch break alone. I casually asked people at the office what they were doing for lunch, and no one invited me or asked me what I was doing, so now I'm at Chipotle sitting by myself.
-8	negative	loneliness	I meet someone and I felt we kicked it off great. as a little time past by I all of a sudden stop hearing from her. so a month later she calls me up n tells me y she stop talking n it was bc she was married. now I had fell for this girl then she stops talking then comes back to tell me she married. im not for dating or talking to someone who is married or dating someone. if I knew she was married before hand I would've walked away but being I didn't I fell for her n care a lot about her but yet theres so much going on that I don't know what to do. any help will b much appreciated
-17	negative	loneliness	i met a friend in my head who knows how many of them i have. he said there are many many. i dont know how many, there is only 62 i could count of. i drew their portraits for a whole night. he said there are some more. 88 he said. im just happy my theory of everyone having a pair is still true. i want everyone to be well and be there for each other. but this means that im alone. all alone. i think i am me. but i feel very very young. and i am mostly asleep for months at a time. its a bit hard to explain that i dont appear online for months. but there is history and it is full of things.. many many bookmark? from the others im sure. it seems that i share my computer with them. oh well i just wanted to say this is why i leave for so long for sometimes..
-15	negative	loneliness	I met a guy, and we spent six amazing months getting to know each other. He made me laugh, and smile and pretty soon we fell in love with each other. And I know it was real, and he was perfect for me. But I lied and the relationship fell apart. Truth is I shouldn't have fallen for him. I should have walked away and not let it happen. It wasn't his fault, it was mine. It would have never worked out and I knew it, but I couldn't walk away. And he fell in love, and I hurt him and we both had to let go, but I miss him and i love him so much it hurts whenever I think about him. The hardest part is knowing that it doesn't matter how I feel, we can't ever go back because he hates me now, but I can't move on. I cry myself to sleep each night, but sometimes thinking of him still makes me smile. My heart hurts, but I don't want to forget. I don't know who to talk to because I can't tell anyone what happened with him, but I need to let it out because it's killing me from the inside.
-11	negative	loneliness	I met this boy late last year and things were going pretty well. We got really close and I really started to feel less lonely. Until now, he met someone else and is totally wrapped up in her. I can feel him drifting from me further and further but I don't know how to stop it. He told me I was beautiful but he said he had no feelings for me. Ok we're never gonna go out, but I don't want him to leave, even though he was never really mine. Now he's gone I have really noticed how lonely I am and it's killing me.
-1	negative	loneliness	I'm feeling extremely lonely right now for some reason :/ I could use someone to talk to. If you're up to chat please do message me.
-2	negative	loneliness	I'm feeling homesick &lt;/3 and I like to talk about it
-1	negative	loneliness	I"m feeling lonely and need someone to talk to me..
-2	negative	loneliness	I'm feeling lonely right now. Someone should engage in conversation with me
-3	negative	loneliness	I'm feeling lost and confused. Anyone above the age of 30 here i can talk to without judgement. No perv chats.
-1	negative	loneliness	I'm feeling really lonely tonight anyone care to chat?
-4	negative	loneliness	I'm feeling unloved in my relationshipmy boyfriend messed up big time this weekend for the third time and WE'VE ONLY BEEN TOGETHER FOR ALMOST EIGHT MONTHS. I snapped and he did his usual promise to me. He was so cold to me last night and today. I'm sadwhy does he do this to meit hurts a lot. I don't know how much more I can take this
-9	negative	loneliness	I'm from Puerto Rico so I see a lot of that horrible creature and tonight was my first close encounter with a freaking ** I was sleeping and I felt something walking in my arm when I got the cell phone to look (first I thought it was my hair) there were a ugly ** on my arm!! I can assure is life changing stuff. I'm not sleeping at my bed tonight  Gosh I hate them so much!
-11	negative	loneliness	I'm getting married next month.. And my fiance is not who i thought he was. I noticed the change a few months ago, he is emotionally distant & less affectionate. I can't recall the last time he tells me he miss me or go out on a romantic date. We do see each other and that is only when i ask to and is usually for wedding errands.  I seek words of wisdom & advice. How do i communicate with him? How do i make him listen? How do i get his attention? How do i make him affectionate again?
-3	negative	loneliness	I'm getting pretty tired of blabbing my mouth to a person who will never be able to actually listen. Sometimes I just feel as if nobody will actually care about what I have to say. I feel so lost most of the time, like maybe some day I will just wake up and my whole life would have just been a long dream. Keeping stuff in is destroying me bit by bit. I feel the hatred towards myself growing as I pass by every slow day. I'm so shy, I don't know how to actual interact with people. Most of the time I feel like I am expected to act a certain way, but most of the time it's just an act. I just wish I could express myself to an individual who would actually not judge, and listen. Just no interruptions. I would like to be able to share the hopes, and fears I have. How I feel. But there's nobody in this world to share all these with. Nobody truly cares. Nobody understands me. At all.
-4	negative	loneliness	I'm going down. A letter could be the only thing that will make me realize tht he loves me, really LOVES me
-17	negative	loneliness	I'm going through a divorce my husband cheated on me September 27 2013 have not seen him since ! But last night had a dream about him . We where at a shopping mall and I walked by him with my family he sent me a text saying "go away" I felt so hurt reading that text and I could see the girl he had the affair with walking away from his car ! Woke up thanking God it was just a dream ! All the emotions felt real when I woke up ! I even had a mini anxiety attack . If you ever lost someone you love you know how it feels even lost someone to death it's the same thing !
-7	negative	loneliness	I'm going through a lot with my girlfriend being pregnant. She hasn't told her parents yet and she's already 2 1/2 months. Yesterday her sister found out and is trying to convince me to get my girlfriend to have an abortion. We are against abortion and taking full responsibility but all this stress is eating me alive. Work, family, girlfriend, anxiety, and being alone all the time with nobody to talk to really doesn't help.
-9	negative	loneliness	I'm going to ask what may be a very stupid question, stick with me for a second. Lol. So my fianc is in bootcamp now, he graduates in February, he recently wrote to me and mentioned maybe getting married on his 10 days leave..my question is, is there like a process we have to go through, or can we just go to a courthouse and do it? Sorry if this is stupid, we're new and learning(: thanks in advance, ladies!
-4	negative	loneliness	I'm going to try and be strong after the news yesterday :/ but tell me .. Does it get any easier???    I know I'm gonna miss him like Crazzyyy ((
-3	negative	loneliness	I'm gonna die alone. The sad part is no matter how hard i try i will always be stuck with myself.
-1	negative	loneliness	I'm gonna go away now bye EP

-5	negative	loneliness	well I had a full day, all my work is done, i enjoyed watching my sons videos as I worked around the house, I can't believe i even decorated the little pine tree i brought I hang some thing up all so around the house  lite his white candles and took pictures of his pictures i put up around the tree, new memories,. The videos oh my God I'm so pleased , Happy, I can't believe I feel this way, He is still here with me, STILL HERE, I'm not going to say I will always feel this way, but with the blessing I have now I'm going to enjoy it,As the say one day at a time,  Good Night
-2	negative	loneliness	I'm half Chiricahua Apache and a quarter Winnebago. I live off the rez- never lived there, only visited- and it would be amazing to talk to another Native. (:
-1	negative	loneliness	I'm having relationship problems I love this boy to death and just everything is a mess I never cut myself before and today was my first day and I like the pain
-2	negative	loneliness	I'm here in bed with my thoughtsso if you want to talk that would be great too.
-13	negative	loneliness	I'm in a crowd Only problem is I'm not apart of it. All these so called 'friends' are there socializing with people I have never seen before. It's torture. Seriously Hello? Do you not see me? So, I walk away, that don't care. They don't even text me later asking me where I am or why I left. Being single, 15, bisexual, socially awkward, weird and a bit anti-social can really make someone feel unwanted. I'm in my own world where, being alone is agonizing but being different is beautiful. I am different and I love it. Finding someone who is also different That'd be nice.
-1	negative	loneliness	I'm in a "relationship" and I've never been so lonely
-2	negative	loneliness	I'm in a relationship but I feel like we are not in love anymore and I feel really lonely even when we are together. Lately we have broken up many times but I feel like I am forced to make things work with him because I am almost 7 months pregnant. I feel like we are stuck in a boring cycle. Has anyone else felt this way? Or have any advice?
-2	negative	loneliness	I'm in a relationship with a lot of doubts but I love him and we've been through a lot. I just don't know how to fix things.
-8	negative	loneliness	I'm in love with my roommate. Not sure what to do. He acts like my boyfriend but he's not putting a label in it. I have to make the decision to stop this relationship because I feel like I have to force him to make a decision. There r times that he acts like my boyfriend and there r times that he doesn't. I know what I need to do but not sure how to go about doing this. Any advice? My heart wants to continue and my mind what's to stop this.

-2	negative	loneliness	I'm insanely antisocial and want friends. Not people who'll talk to me for a few days and then ignore me.. I get attached to people easily sometimes ;^;
-5	negative	loneliness	Im insanly agoraphobic (scared of people; social anxiety) and slow to warm up to new people in person. So consequently i only have 3 good girlfriends who i can really talk to about stuff. But theyre always busy so i spend a lot of time alone with my cat. Gets a bit lonely but Mittens is a good listener 
-3	negative	loneliness	I'm in such a rut and would like at least someone to talk to my minds in shambles and I'm pretty much going crazy right now
-4	negative	loneliness	I'm in the process of making a psychological toolkit of sorts.  The reason being it brings me comfort and the chance to refine my abilities as a sociopath.  I've already got a few sections; rules, emotions, manipulation/strategy, cruelty, and a few others.  I was simply wondering if anyone would be able to point the way to some useful material or have valid input.
-5	negative	loneliness	I'm invisible. At break and lunch, I'm standing with my 2 "friends". But they just talk and laugh with each other while I'm standing alone silently. They tell each other "You're my best friend!" What about me? What am I? Then when they don't have anyone to be with, they pretend like I'm their best friend. When they need something, they pretend to be my friend. No I don't want to be used. I'm around people but they don't talk to me. Ok I'd rather sit in the bathroom alone and do whatever I want then be ignored by my supposed "friends". When I try to say something, they don't hear it and talk about their things.
-2	negative	loneliness	I miscarried on July 9th, 2013. That was the most horrific and heartbreaking day of my life.  So, my little son, Leo. Born sleeping on July 9th, 2013.
-7	negative	loneliness	I miss him, my darling man. I'm so proud, too. He's been away for so long, but for something amazing: he's following his dream. Every night, I fall asleep happy, but also sad, lonely Craving to fall asleep in his arms and whisper, "goodnight baby, I'll see you in my dreams". I miss those moments we used to have together when he was here. Oh and how I miss his laugh, his smile. Holding his hand and feeling his strong arms hold me tight. I felt so safe. It seems too long before I get to see him again Keep following your dreams babe, I'll be here with open arms for when you come home &lt;3
-3	negative	loneliness	I miss him so much this week  all wanna do is cuddle up in his arms, and smell him, and feel him, and hear his heart beat. I miss tickle fight, and jokes, and kisses, and holding hands. I adore my man, and he holds my heart in his hand.. When he isn't next to me, it feels like a part of me is missing. But I'm being good, I'm staying strong. I'm keeping busy and doing my best to be happy. I can't wait to see him next Monday! I love you D. Stefani.
-13	negative	loneliness	I miss him soooo much! He's the only one whose ever understood/ delt w me in such a good way! No ones been so understanding. He's sending me letters freaking out about us, thinking I've found someone else or will because it's 4 months a part little does he know I love him more than anything in this world.. I'd never and could never leave him! He's a blessing in disguise and no matter how far he is I will always fight for him because I love him! He's worth it Worth more than anyone else or anything in my life.. And I want this forever &lt;3
-5	negative	loneliness	I miss my Layla so much, I all I really want to do is lay around and cry all day. I always try to put a smile on my face just so I won't worry my mom, but I feel so empty and alone. The only thing that would make me better is having my daughter. I just want to be with her, I wish someone will just kill me to take away this pain. I feel so horrible on a daily basis. I hate seeing pregnant women and babies, every time i see a baby or pregnant women when I'm out I literally run the other way.  I download all these baby apps just so I know what she would doing if she was here and all changes she would be going through. She will be 3 months on dec. 19.  I just don't know what to do anymore, I'm tired of hurting.
-2	negative	loneliness	I miss you so much that I can't stop my tears sometimes. I try really hard. I know I have to move on. You were my best friend , and I am so alone and lost without you to talk to me. I miss you Sunshine! My heart is broken. I wish I could just tell youI know I can't 
-4	negative	loneliness	Im jealous that other couples take funny crazy waky photos but im not able to for some reason my GF does with her siblings family and friends but not me for some reason i dont like being photographed
-5	negative	loneliness	I'm just feeling stressful tonight. I have financial problems and my boyfriend these days doesn't listen to me when I need him too. He always compares mine to his. I'm also not feeling well because of my weight. I've gained about 10lbs while in winter vacation.
-2	negative	loneliness	I'm just so lonely right now. I'm there for everyone. I'm just that 2nd choice person.
-3	negative	loneliness	I'm just wonder if a guy would ever accept me for who i am. What if I'm never good enough for any guy
-9	negative	loneliness	I'm kind of new to this, or reaching out in general. Ive been having the roughest time in my life, and honestly I have no one to turn to aside from a couple of family members. My mother is very ill from a condition that has been slowly killing her for 5 years. She is now weeks if not days from passing away. On top of this, my support or so I thought gf of 6 years is not talking to me at all during this time, she just left I am at a hard place in my life, and just need a friend. Im kind of scared because I have never had to face darkness like this before. If anyone has gone through a similar situation or just wants to weigh in, I would be happy to talk. 
-3	negative	loneliness	I'm kind of upset today and feel all alone. I'm on the train to home and feel totally lonely
-2	negative	loneliness	I'm learning the importance of talking about your issues. I don't really like it, but I'm doing my best.
-7	negative	loneliness	I'm lonely and it bothers me a lot. At the same time I realize I'm better of alone because it seems like I only make people lives harder. And when somebody comes into my life and leaves i feel worse than I did before. So I tend to stay away from people so I don't feel abandoned so much. Feeling is abandoned is sooo much worse than feeling lonely. I speak from experience.
-1	negative	loneliness	I'm lonely and no one seems to message me but pervs and creeps D: wish I had someone nice to talk to
-1	negative	loneliness	I'm lonely because all of my friends are busy. It's a horrible feeling, when you want to chat with someone but you know you can't because they're too busy. It makes you feel less important.
-8	negative	loneliness	I'm Lonely because I know there is someone out there for me but the empty feeling makes me want to never talk to My thoughts because to me everyone hurts me in the end I don't want that anymore I swear it's getting harder everyday with the empty feeling but I hope there will be someoneI know there will befor now I will be aloneit's better this way..
-2	negative	loneliness	I'm lonely but I'll be damned before I make another huge mistake !!!
-3	negative	loneliness	Im lonely i dnt have nobody to talk to ! Hope someone talks to me ! Bout everything
-7	negative	loneliness	I'm lonely since my daughters were taken away from me. I've never done one thing wrong to them all I have them was love & affection I was there everytime they cried. Their dad was violent & it's taken all this for him to calm down. I want them back with me, life is horrible and dull now. My girls are my life.
-5	negative	loneliness	I'm looking for a man to share talks with. I'm married, yet I'm lacking that in our relationship. Someone that challenges me, has similar interests, and things to say about the world. Message me and we'll see if we might be compatible!
-2	negative	loneliness	I'm looking for new friends to be real no betrayed my old friends is deceased out of town or in prison for life I'm looking for to have new friends not to judge me just to except for who Im am
-8	negative	loneliness	I'm loosing my mind, I have one person in my life that I could talk to. Problem is I feel me and her have grown apart we haven't seen eye to eye in a long time. So here I am alone with no one to talk to and it's driving me crazy. I can only talk to myself for so long.
-1	negative	loneliness	I'm miserable..  Someone please talk to me.
-1	negative	loneliness	I'm missing him like crazy Guess ill be eternally heartbroken
-13	negative	loneliness	I'm mixed w Shawnee n Tsalagi (Cherokee) w no shame! I'm not 100% Native American but I guess I got a good combination since I've nvr been told I'm ugly lol. I do get annoyed when white guys think I want to get w them just bc they've been watching too much t.v. There's 2 many movies and romance novels featuring natives oursuing whites when the fact is we have no reason to not like eachother we r the beautiful ppl, the tall, dark n sexy! I also hate when white ppl try to tell me they're granny is a cherokee princess or they're related to pocasellout(Pocahontas).
-3	negative	loneliness	I'm new here, and feeling pretty low I was gonna vent but I'll save that for my other posts. So I'm just introducing myself.
-12	negative	loneliness	I'm new here and my love just left for boot camp. I got to say goodbye last night, well I didn't say it but that's what it was. I love him so much. He broke up with me because he says you can't have a relationship when you can't be together. But we are still very much in love. He told my friend that we may get married some day. But for now it can't happen. He said he will write. And I sincerely hope he does but he's not much of a writer and his whole family is begging him to write. I just don't want to lose him.
-1	negative	loneliness	I'm new here.. But I feel like a stranger to everyone. Even those that are closest to me, it's like I'm afraid to show people the real me. I'm afraid of everything.
-1	negative	loneliness	I m new on skype and I don't have any friends can anyone plz be my friend whom I could talk to
-2	negative	loneliness	I'm new, so I'd just like to chat and see what's going on here 
-1	negative	loneliness	I'm new to this app and I got it because yes, I'm lonely. I'm a sophomore and I don't have many friends. I get made fun of a lot because I'm different. I came here hoping to find people who understand me better. I don't judge at all. I certainly don't have room to be judging anyone. I just need friends.
-6	negative	loneliness	I'm not a mean person. I love everyone, no matter their gender, color, size, or social status. I'm a good friend, I let my friends borrow my stuff, give them adivce, even harm myself helping them, yetI find myself alone. My friends somewhere without me. I feel so bad. My friends call me weird when I say the most kind and careful things. I really wish I could live on another  planet. I'm abandoned and now I feel so terrible, no one calls me, texts me, or even talks to me.I really hate my life
-2	negative	loneliness	I'm not  but if you are and want to speak to someone , Message me
-2	negative	loneliness	im not really afraid to end up alone, but when i was younger, i was sure at this time i will have my own family, but still, or lets say again i am single.and i dont have kids. and i met quite a lot people which made me feel not alone.of course they cant replace a family, a girlfriend, but i can tell, some of my friendships are better than some relationships i can see in my friends circle.
-11	negative	loneliness	I'm not really alone, I have my dog an my cats. I have friends and family, but no one I can talk to. My boyfriend makes me feel more alone than ever. I'm pregnant, my baby will be here soon. I'm in a lot of pain, physically. I can't get help around the house, or with picking out things for the baby. I feel like I'm doing this all on my own. This isn't the life I wanted. He doesn't look at me anymore, its like I'm not even here. Everything I say is annoying to him, and I'm afraid to let him see me cry. I haven't been hugged or held in months. When I try to hug him or get close, he pushes me away. I just want to feel special again. I'm always last on his priorities list it seems like. I'm afraid to have this baby because I know I'll be raising him alone. I just need a break. I cry all yhe time, I feel so stupid. 
-5	negative	loneliness	Im not really in need of anyone to talk to. But I want this guy to       tell me who he is. Hes funny intelligent and smart. But someone please tell him to understand this girl's inner voice. Oh and hes the member of this experience Mr.gold19
-1	negative	loneliness	I'm not sleepy; I'm bored. I don't have anyone else to talk to at this time, so feel free to talk!
-14	negative	loneliness	I'm not someone who needs constant reassurance, but as the days go by, I could use some advice. My man has been gone for a little over two months and graduates from basic training in 29 days. I've gotten two letters since he's been gone. I know he's busy and I assumed letters would be scarce, but I had lunch with the girlfriend of a guy in my boyfriend's platoon who has received ten letters since they've been gone. I'm just disheartened and worried. I see everyone's posts about receiving their 8th letter or more and I just feel ridiculous for writing him every day if something changed and he doesn't feel the same as he did. I would appreciate some advice or anything. Thank you all so much. I hope you all are well.
-5	negative	loneliness	I'm not so sure what to think anymore. I'm the problem, I'm the one that hurts everyone. I've been going with depression and self harm for the past year, but the worst thing is that people think they know me. people pretend that they like me and it hurts so much. I hate getting close to people because at the end of the day they always hurt me. so now I push people away, instead of being more hurt, but It's the fact that I can't say the truth, I build everything up inside of me then I take the anger out on my body and myself, I was a mistake. I should of never been born.
-16	negative	loneliness	I'm not sure if this is going to help me. I really don't see what can right now. I lost my best friend of 23 years. I met him when I was 17 and he was 21. He was so adorable. I'm sure he would hate for me to describe him that way, but he was. It's strange but we never married. I always felt married in my heart and I think he felt that way too. We have an amazing 21 year old son together.  How I ended up having raised such a wonderful kid is beyond me, because I don't deserve him.      The weight is crushing. It pushes me in on myself and I can't breath. I can't see a way past this pain. Everyone says time will heal all things and maybe it does. But right now all I see is the endless time without him.
-5	negative	loneliness	I'm not sure what I'm all about anymore. My mind is very dangerous. I've recently discovered that I'm an Omnitheist(believing that all gods exist, and are all equal)  For better or for worse.
-3	negative	loneliness	I'm not the one to openly tell people how I feel unless your a close friend or my family.  As I've seen friends and close people come and go I've learned that the depths of your mind and your thoughts can be your best friend in the worst times
-3	negative	loneliness	I'm not very good with expressing myself. If you know me, you would agree. I usually don't tell many people my personal problems. Consider yourself a close friend if I do tell you.
-9	negative	loneliness	I'm on antidepressants and have been taking them for three years. Even though they've helped a bit and i'm on a good dose, I still have days when my life feels hopeless and pointless. I love my family, my boyfriend and my pets but if i was thinner, cleverer or cooler maybe i'd be happier? Or maybe i wouldn't? What's the point in life? We all end up dying anyway.
-6	negative	loneliness	I'm one of five kids, I'm the oldest and  such a disappointment to my parents an my family.. Well so they say. I don't have any qualifications but I have had 4 jobs.. I'm looking for a job now with good money and I have a few interviews which is good. Yet I still feel like I have to please my parents :'( please if anyone is having similar problems message me.. I have no direction and don't know what to do with my life or where I want to go..
-5	negative	loneliness	I'm on here to find friends to have a chat about anything. I'm not here for dating etc so please don't ask as I'm not interested. I live with my partner and would never cheat on him as I love him to bits.
-3	negative	loneliness	I moved a state away from my girlfriend and am still dating her. Without her I am so lonely. She makes me extremely happy and when I am not talking to her I get even more lonely.
-6	negative	loneliness	I moved last year, made new friends, and everything was perfect up until a fight. Now I have no REAL friends here, and I feel completely alone. I have a couple friends in class but they all already have best friends. They don't need me to have a good time. Since I have moved to a different town, I only stayed close to 1 or 2 friends. But they both seem to have moved on since I've been gonethey have new best friends and I am sitting here curled up in a ball wondering if anyone cares about me anymore. There's no worse feeling then knowing you've been replacedI still haven't moved on. I'm not too close with my family. After school all I do is go up to my room and shut out the world. It doesn't help when my mom clearly favours my sister over me. I really need someone right now, I feel so forgotten & un-needed right now.
-6	negative	loneliness	i moved to the US 5 years ago because my family lives here, plus my health problem. it was a big change of my life. i have to left my best friends, my job, the beach and my usual life that i used to be. i don't have a lot of friend here. i have a few and it seems like we don't really have something in common.  i feel that they too girly for me. or maybe i'm just a weirdo. they do nothing but talking about others in a bad way. i can't handle it. so i decided to isolated myself from social. i love the beach, i love food, music. i enjoy everything that i love by myself. i felt so good at that time. i lived like this for year and relized that deep inside i'm still lonely. everybody need friends.  
-1	negative	loneliness	I'm paranoid, because my father is paranoid and doesn't trust people. And one day I asked him why O.O .  .  Yeah I have some trust issues lol. _
-1	negative	loneliness	I'm popular as you would say, everyone is my freind. But none of my freinds actually know me!!, I'm lonely!, there isn't one person to talk to about my feelings, sometimes I wake up and I just wish god didn't wake me up, that I jus would stay asleep!!, I wish I could jus die sometimes!!
-17	negative	loneliness	I'm pretty sure I'm gonna die alone. Every guy I meet hates me. When I'm with my sister and I see a guy I want to talk to, he ignores me and talks to my sister because they think she's hotter. I met a guy I like at school and I thought he liked me but he completely turned on me. He acted like he liked me but then he stopped talking to me. Yeah I'm gonna die alone and I don't know why people hate me so much.
-3	negative	loneliness	I'm probably all broken by now. Every time I put a piece of my heart back together, it breaks apart again. I can't be fixed :'( I wish someone would try to help me put my heart back together.
-1	negative	loneliness	I'm quiet bored at the moment and my head is starting to get loud message me peeps
-1	negative	loneliness	Im REALLY lonely and I mean it.  
-2	negative	loneliness	I'm scared about growing up. I'll be graduating next year and I'm scared about what's going to happen after highschool. I'm leaving a small little town in Canada and heading to NYC to attend (hopefully anyways) NYCU or Julliard. I'm terrified that I'm not going to make it and fail at life and always be broke and living in a shamble of an apartment. I don't want to grow up, but I can't stay here anymore. I can't live in a small town that doesn't even show up on the GPS. I need to be somewhere big and where dreams come true. I just want someone to be there with me. To guide me, and to care for me. 
-3	negative	loneliness	I'm scared of the unknown, I'm scared of losing the people I love forever, no body really knows what happens till it happens, What if this is really all there is. This life right here right now, I'm scared of there being nothing for me after I die.
-1	negative	loneliness	I'm sick of life I'm am sick of everything I really cbfa anymore no point!!!!
-3	negative	loneliness	I'm sick of people not liking me when all I try to be is nice maybe I try to hard, maybe I'm weird, or maybe I don't fit in I want to be needed by my loved ones. I HAVE to feel needed or else I don't think I have much purpose in this life.
-1	negative	loneliness	I'm sitting across the living room with my bf who is texting god knows who while we air here in silence. Alone while in the same room
-2	negative	loneliness	Im so alone and depressed all the time. Im constantly anxious and i cant trust anybody because im scared of people. Im scared to go out the house everyday, im scared to speak to people i do not know in person, im just scared of people. I just worry about what they think about me because i have scars nearly all over my body and i dont eat and i hate myself im always putting myself down. Ive been having quite a few panic attacks lately aswell. Its all getting worse, just when i thought that things could get better. So now i just isolate myself.
-5	negative	loneliness	Im so alone I have no family and no friends when i was younger i was put into care i think that was the start of having no family support ,and when i went out with my exx boyfriend i lost all my friends because he was so controlling and i was so vunrable we split up i found out i was pregnant then also. Now im a single mum and dont get much time for myself, to socialise. I feel like the lonliest person in the world, even tho i have a beautiful son. I need someone to hold me. Ive cut my life story short so much has happened to me.
-3	negative	loneliness	Im so annoyed at my mum again! as mwntioned in previous bloody posts her total owing to me has GONE UP 100 DUE TO HER BEING SKINT AND TO MAKE IT WORSE ITS FRICKING OVERDRAWN IN MY ACCOUNT ALL OF IT SO IRRITATING! My sister then borrowed money from me too for a party, im like.. not like I have to fricking live! SO ANNOYING! ANYHOW NOW THEY ARE FIGHTING AND MUM WENT FOR MY SISTER. IT TOOK ALL MY STRENGTH NOT TO STOP HER! EURGGHH
-3	negative	loneliness	I'm so depressed I can't even cry. I  can't even talk about it. I trust no one. I want to be around no one because my distrust is so great. I used to believe in the  good of the world and all of humanity,  but I  don't anymore.  I've been betrayed by all. I find happiness in nothing and suspicion on everyone. 
-1	negative	loneliness	I'm so lonely I have nothing to do but lay here on the floor staring at the ceiling..
-2	negative	loneliness	I'm so lonely. Not love wise. Just friend wise. All my girlfriends seem to have kids now, I don't. My bf and I want kids but I'm busy with schooling at home and work at home. I get so lonely. Plus live in a very rural area, been snowed in all week. So bored , lonely and in a rut 
-6	negative	loneliness	I'm so lonely, that before or after October. That I was so depressed I cut my self twice, let the blood running . Almost passed out. But ima libra, I liked to be happy,etc. When having no friends to come by or good friend to cheer you up. It really gets me down,love music. That is sometimes the only that get me up. Wish I had somebody to talk ,bf or gf. I just hate being lonely.
-2	negative	loneliness	Im so lonley i have no friends i need love and people who will help me
-2	negative	loneliness	I'm soooo bored someone message me!!
-1	negative	loneliness	I'm sooo tired of hurting, being sad and depressed. It's getting harder to put on a fake smile.
-2	negative	loneliness	I'm so sad because my step brother and father torment and humiliate me. My mother also died. I long for a friend.
-7	negative	loneliness	I'm so tired of trying!!! I'm a 45 year old man with big dreams and a big heart. Too many times my heart has been broken. I've always been soft hearted and for that, I've paid a dear price. I've been abused mentally and physically by both of my wives. When I stood up to them then I went to jail! In this town its not what you know its who you know or if your pretty enough you get away with anything!!!  People say that women don't abuse man, BULL!!! 
-15	negative	loneliness	I'm so upset lately honesty I'm tired of acting like I'm not. I got kicked out of public high school for bad grades. Now I go to alternative school of miss. Fits and I don't fit in at all. Everyone there hates me and makes fun of me. I stand alone but hey the strongest person stands alone right.  Wrong I'm weak lately. I go home and cry. I had a boyfriend at this school and I broke up with him he made everyone hate me. This other guy I like more than anything but he said the rudest things to me. What's bothering me tonight was that my best friend since middle school 6th grade till my senior year now hates me. She doesn't wanna be friends anymore cause she's friends with this one girl who hates me. I swear my life gets so hard sometimes. But like I always tell myself at the end of the dark road there's always some light.
-5	negative	loneliness	I'm so used to feeling worthless. People walk away when I'm talking to them, like I'm not even there. I've been rejected so many times, and if I'm actually accepted I get dumped. Even on this site, I don't have any friends. It's just upsetting and yeah
-1	negative	loneliness	Im super bored housewife! !!
-2	negative	loneliness	"I'm that person that everyone replaces after a while."
-6	negative	loneliness	I'm that soft spoken boy that cares too much and is always overlooked. I recently experienced a break up, it wasn't particularly messy but I was in love with the girl. As a result, I began to see my friends leave one after the other, now, sadly, it's come to the stage where I have none. Someone kind and perceptive to speak to would be much appreciated and i'd be more than happy to return the favour.
-4	negative	loneliness	I'm the only child of my family, i didn't feel any loneliness till now, people used to ask (don't you feel Alone?) i used to answer them , you can't know the taste of something if u never experienced it..i adapted myself to live with me..but now things changed i'm 23 years old , i have a boyfriend ..and i feel a deep loneliness whenever he's not around ..and i feel depressed because of that..i hate the fact that you get used to someone so much that you can't stand staying with yourself for an hour 
-14	negative	loneliness	I'm the only single person within my group of friends and it's killer. They are always talking about how great their relationship is and how happy they are. I'm happy for them but it kills me when they are always like that around me, talking about how great everything is. I try so hard to put of a brave face everyday and put on a smile so they don't see how truly hard it is for me but it's getting harder. I'm tired of being single but guys never stick around long enough to get to know me, they usually just try to see if I put out which I don't cause I respect myself. I just want someone to love me for me.
-9	negative	loneliness	I'm thinking about my ex so much that I can't concentrate on anything else. I left him 3 years ago because I had a manic episode of my bipolar.. It's like I woke up one day and realized that I made the biggest mistake ever. I ended up conceiving a son with an abusive boyfriend while I was having a manic episode. And while my son is so beautiful, and lifts me up. I'm still stuck on the ex that I left behind 3 years ago. I cry about him constantly. I'm extremely suicidal. I had a plan. I'm afraid that I won't ever love someone else again. I've never been attracted to anyone else. I'm afraid of being unhappy for the rest of my life. Please tell me it doesn't last forever. I want to enjoy my son and be happy.
-1	negative	loneliness	I'm thirsty. Wish i had some vodka xD
-3	negative	loneliness	I'm tired of being poor. I'm a wife who's husband can't find a job, his truck is broke down. I work at ups, but have no gas to make it the rest of the week. This paycheck won't cover next week either. I eat once a day and I'm grateful for even that, but I miss the life I used to live. The life of a kid with wealthy parents and the right meals, healthy food, and laundry soap. I miss the security of a home, while I'm close to losing mine. My providing for myself and my husband is getter harder and harder each day.
-6	negative	loneliness	I'm tired of being the person who is alone. I know I'm not the only person alone on the planet however it sure feels that way a lot.  Friends tell me to keep busy, put myself out there and that someday that will change however it's been over 7 years still try to keep busy, still putting myself out there and constantly learning new things yet I'm still alone. Learning is a great experience, wonderful to share with others and it's not time wasted, however I still am the one alone and it's hard to deal with and getting harder as time goes on.
-9	negative	loneliness	im tired of crying theres just so much going on with me my financial situation is at an all time low im so alone even though i have friends i could never tell them the way things truly are and what im truly going through. I never wanted to have to go through such agony in my life and it feels so much like i dont deserve it. Tears come  at random moments when im alone when i think about where my life is at not only do i want to help myself but also my family . My health is not the best and going to a doctor is like climbing the tallest mountain i feel like my dreams are slipping away due to constant setbacks that just keep occurring and on top of all that i left a girl who i truly do love on an immature whim . Shes engaged now and im pretty sure her love for me is now nothing more than a memory i miss her so much and sometimes the slightest thought or the wrong song sends me into a crying episode i shed so many tears and its tough to bare this life.
-6	negative	loneliness	I'm tired of it , and because I'm naturally a shy person Well I have a feeling I'll be like this for quite sometime. Of course, however I'm hoping that for 2014 I'll finally meet someone but something tells me that I won't.
-1	negative	loneliness	I'm tired. Tired of never being good enough. Never being skinny enough. Never being smart enough. Never being pretty enough. When will I ever be enough? For anyone?  
-1	negative	loneliness	I'm up too early, chat me up
-4	negative	loneliness	I must be from another planet. Why is sleeping with people not even considered a big deal. I can't believe how easily some women give their body up and how many men sleep with women like they're trophies to get. No wonder it's so many damaged people. I may be old fashion but if I'm not in love with a woman I won't sleep with her. It takes me at least six months to realize I'm in love. Men if you're just going to sleep with a woman and that's all you want. Don't complain about how women are money hungry and manipulative. Women don't expect a man to respect you if you sleep with him easily. This vicious cycle needs to end. 
-1	negative	loneliness	I must have sneezed, on knees I freezeyer_detailpage&v=I348b5FUDFQ
-3	negative	loneliness	I'm very affectionate and caring with people I love. I just wish I had some of that In return. I would love to know that someone loves and cares for me

-10	negative	loneliness	I m very lonely all my life.  people first are interested in me but then for some reason they allways leave me. i became so lonely lately that even exactly such lonely people like me stop chatting to me online. Im so glad that i have a hus and daughter, but its like they live with me, but they doesnt help me at all.im still feeling so awful lonely. I am often online, i rarelly go out. I became addicted to watching movies and i dont care about my looks. Im this typical lonely woman who just exists from unreal things like being fanatic, movies, chats with people online. I feel like people outside doesnt want to reach out, i feel like they know how miserable i am. The worst thing is, i dont want to try to change this ituation. Its like i know it will anyway never change. Im stuck like this for many years now. I feel ashamed of ending like this and nobody cares.
-8	negative	loneliness	I'm very lonely tonight seems like when I meet a new friend it lasts for about a month the just fizzes out. All I'm looking for is a female friend to chat with laugh and talk. If it leads to something great if not I've made a new friend.

-1	negative	loneliness	In a horrible marriage and want someone i can talk to and maybe flirt to feel like a man again
-5	negative	loneliness	In a previous story I discussed the dangers of remaining silent when a victim is confronted with bullying. Outcomes such as social anxiety, PTSD and even death are very likely when bullying is concerned. This time however I want to look at bullying from the bystanders perspective. As usual check out the full article @  Now updated daily on weekdays!
-2	negative	loneliness	Incredibly lonely. Even though I have managed to make a few friends on the internet, I'm still really lonely, and I've felt this way for my entire life.

-1	negative	loneliness	I need a older brother to show me the ropes and teach me things. Dad isn't here in my life. :/
-7	negative	loneliness	I needed someone to talk to, so I spoke softly to my soul.  I needed to see the light, so I let my sprit shine. I needed to be consoled, so I let my inner self weep.  I needed a Knight in shinning armour, so I picked up my sword and shield.  I needed peace, so I gathered some wisdom.
-2	negative	loneliness	I need help. Someone who is willing to take some time out of their life, I need you. Just a few minutes is all it really takes. Just give me some motivation to continue on this dreadful path called life.  Just read my experiences and if you can help me. Please do. Please try. That's all anyone can ask for.

-1	negative	loneliness	I need someone to listen to my problems without judging.. I want to find someone who I can relate to and has the same problem of not being happy with their gender.
-1	negative	loneliness	I need someone to sit beside me, someone who cares, someone who'll share a cupcake just to be sweet. I need someone to kiss me goodnight, to tell me to sleep tight, and wake me up in the morning with an early greeting. When you are in need, you are all alone indeed!
-2	negative	loneliness	I need someone to talk to, just to talk. I feel too alone here so if anyone would like to talk please message me
-1	negative	loneliness	I need someone to talk to. My wife rarely speaks to me anymore!!!

But then I go to the find people thing an type in all my problems and things about me an then it says there's no one with this an that or there's no groups fot this or whatever.. then I message people with some of the same stuff I wanna talk about but then they act like they don't wanna effing talk I never talk about my feeling but I'm trying to. F it. I'm sick an tired of bein sick an tired.. I'm alone an ill just have to effin deal with it.
-5	negative	loneliness	I never felt alone for the last 5 years, then that all changed. Some say, you just need a mate, some say you need a lover, some say a companion; others have said all three. I had the perfect best friend, a constant and vigilant companion;
-10	negative	loneliness	I never got on with my parents or get on with them. They threw me out for a month first, Had bad anxiety then and was alone and noone wanted anything to do with me (they have always hated me and always belittle me) I went away to uni after but it was awful, i was alone, noone moved in for a long while after, I hated myy job, i was the only english one for miles around (Im not racist but i mean they didnt speak english) the place was full of gangs, i had mild panic attacks etc Then i had to come home, when i came back they still hate me and that so i chose a uni i could commute too but now getting the train, as i leave my home i know ill go back but i cant breathe and i panic and i feel alone. Ive tried talking to my mum but she dismisses it saying its 'pathetic' and she doesnt care. We have now moved to the middle of nowhere, so i have no dr surgery i can go too. I just feel alone all the time at the moment. I have friends, and i should be happy but i am not !
-2	negative	loneliness	I never realized how lonely I am without him. Goodness. 
-9	negative	loneliness	I never thought I would ever say this but now I understand the people who once told me they felt lonely. I think I feel this way because I want to feel this way. I feel lonely but I kinda like it. But am I truly lonely? I have no idea, perhaps I purposely make myself become lonely. When I want to cry for help I just make myself more distant from others. I hate being around people, I think I love being lonely.
-1	negative	loneliness	I never thought i would feel this loneliness. Once i had my house full noise. How i miss that. Im divorced, children are big and family members moved away. I battle sadly every day. I come home from work to be alone. I cry in my bed every day. How I wish i could hear that noise again.
-2	negative	loneliness	I never thought that I could ever go through with taking my own life, I'm 39, I have a masters degree and a good job, I have been battling depression all my life, I have BDP, I assaulted someone who was trying to leave me, as bpd's know we can't bear abandonment, I was arrested and charged with multiple misdemeanors, there is a HUGE possibility i will lose my job. I struggle with maintaining close relationship with people, I do not know what is left for me to live for. I have been in therapy for 4 years, I feel shame and remorse for what I did. My therapist explains that it is childhood trauma, she knows it well. I panic and become afraid and go into fight or flight mode I'm A good person. I don't feel good, she says I internalize that I am bad and I just get over it all.
-11	negative	loneliness	I never thought that I would lose her. When my father had passed and I had gone four months of my mother secretly taking alcohol as a daily relief for her mourning of my fathers death. I had turned eleven and at school, I had endured bullying to the point of suicide.  Blabbering that it was all her fault. Next thing I knew, my mother, had committed suicide and I was put into the care of my aunt, which meant that I had to move, I had to move to a place named New Zealand.
-4	negative	loneliness	In every sense possible. I don't mind being alone, but it hurts to be lonely. I feel I can't relate to anyone. I'm an oddity. I don't belong anywhere. I find it very difficult to connect with others, I don't feel nobody really understands or gets me.  I wish I could find someone who actually does. I cry because I am so alone, I'm so isolated, I try but I feel there must be something wrong with me. I'm in need of a real friend, sadly I've never had a long lasting true friendship. I'm tired of walking alone everyday. One can only embrace their lonesomeness for a small amount of time, I cannot seek the good in it anymore because it really brings me down. 
-1	negative	loneliness	In life I came to find that everyone I grew to care for, will hurt me in some shape or form. To the point in which I anticipate it. I'm not sure if words can solve this problem, but some guidance would be lovely.
-4	negative	loneliness	In my email this morning were 15 messages from Psychic Source offering me 50% off their online psychic readings.If they were REALLY psychic, wouldnt they already know I dont want their crap?
-13	negative	loneliness	In my last year of middle school around thanksgiving I got a letter. It said that she never kissed a guy before and she wanted md to be my first. She didn't say who she was and it said she didn't even talk to me. I find it scary that she knows where I live, even better the letter wasn't stamped by the post office, which meant she even knows what mailbox I use, that is impossible not to be scary.
-2	negative	loneliness	In my usual routine of exploring the Schools Hallways (during lunch of course) I couldn't help but notice the beautiful grey of the sky. There was a slight drizzle in the cool December air,  and I had taken a moment to bask in the melancholy of the uneventful day. The Taping of the weak rain feel around me and I would have liked to have shared such a depressingly  peaceful moment with someone other than myself; someone who could indulge in the sad weather and find consolation in it. Quite the relief, melancholy.  
-3	negative	loneliness	I no longer have anybody. My best friend ditched me for a newer one. A friend said she hated me and called a corrections facility on me. My paranoia is getting worse. I feel like I'm inches from death all the time. My mental disorders are worsening. The worst part is the emptiness, the loneliness. Suffering through it without a friend.
-3	negative	loneliness	In reality, I'm slowly losing my mind. Underneath the guise of smile, gradually I'm dying inside. Friends ask me how I feel and I lie convincingly. Cause I dont want to reveal the fact that I'm suffering. So I wear my disguise till I go home at night and turn down all the lights and then I break down and cry."I'm So Lonely " have no one to exspress my feelings to -beauty Dawkins
-4	negative	loneliness	Inside my own family It's now almost two years since my mum's diagnosis and she's been given the all-clear, but things are still strained within our family.  My dad tries sometimes to be nice to me, but other times he can be so cold that it feels as though I'm no longer being treated as part of the family.  I know I should talk to them about it, but I don't have the courage to.  I don't get upset about it, more angry than anything.  I'm his daughter, and sometimes I feel as though he doesn't even see me.  He hardly ever treats me as his daughter, I feel like I'm just a girl renting a room from him.
-4	negative	loneliness	In the past, when I try to let my feelings out, especially to my family, I am always told that I am making too much out of nothing and ruining everyone's time, even if the problem is tearing me up inside. So to get along. I pretend to be okay. If I didn't, I'd have no relationships with anyone in my family.
-6	negative	loneliness	Introversion"the state of or tendency toward being wholly or predominantly concerned with and interested in one's own mental life". An introvert is likely to enjoy time spent alone and find less reward in time spent with large groups of people, though he/she may enjoy interactions with close friends. Trust is usually an issue of significance: a virtue of utmost importance to introverts is choosing a worthy companion. They prefer to concentrate on a single activity at a time and like to observe situations before they participate.  Wikipedia  
-2	negative	loneliness	I often feel like in just so alone. That no one wants to talk to me or even cares. Sometimes I like being alone, but whenever I need someone they're not there. I just feel like I have to do everything myself, deal with my own emotions without any help. It's killing me inside.
-5	negative	loneliness	I often find that I'm surrounded by people, but I always feel alone.  I did not have a traditional upbringing and was often alone.  Because of this, I've become quite a loner.  I enjoy being around people very much, but find that I can never feel comfortable about really expressing myself.  I can become whatever I need to in order to fit in, but never show anyone what I'm really like.  I think it's because I'm afraid that if they knew everything about me, they wouldn't like me anymore.  Hopefully, I can express myself here without feeling that way.  I haven't been on this site for a long time, but I am feeling very lonely and need to talk.
-5	negative	loneliness	I often wish my life was like the film sliding doors, I could pin point where I made the wrong choices and take the right path. Or perhaps I should never have had the once upon a time stories, god bless shrek, it shows Prince Charming is a front and the normal not so perfect fella will make you happy
-2	negative	loneliness	I once almost caused my mum to crash the car due to freaking out over a spider. I really need to get this under control. I managed to Hoover up a big fat dead one assisted by my flat mate. I was absolutely hysterical doing it though!! Still this is a small step forward right?
-18	negative	loneliness	I once dated this guy and something about him was really off. We dated for two years and I was never allowed to meet his friends. He told me that this was because his friends were nerds and [I] wouldnt like them. Then after we broke up, he told me that it was really because when he was around his friends was when he got to be who he really was. A couple of times, during the relationship, I caught him using different personalities with different people. These personalities were so different, that it kind of freaked me out a little. When I said something to him about it, he informed me that he was consciously aware that he was doing this. That was the point when I realized something was seriously wrong.  
-5	negative	loneliness	I only feel lonely when my husband is around. When I'm home alone or with my kids, I'm perfectly happy. For years, I've noticed I feel lonely as soon as he's with me. We've been married 21 years and have three teens. Can someone help me make sense of this?
-3	negative	loneliness	I only got to hold my angel one day after he was born stillborn. Losing my child is the hardest thing I deal with everyday. I miss that little boy so much. He will always be my little superhero.  To read the full story of my pregnancy check out my story- Jakoby Anthony
-3	negative	loneliness	I only had one boyfriend so far in my life, I am lonely I want to know how a real relationship feels like &lt;/3
-1	negative	loneliness	I play games to fight my loneliness away  I really don't want to get into this story Ill tell someone if they want to hear
-4	negative	loneliness	I prefer to be alone or with a couple people that are special to me but that doesn't mean I don't get lonely.  The best way I can explain it for me at least is it doesn't matter if I'm alone at the time or in a crowd of hundreds.  There is no one in my life that touches my heart or that I touch hers.  It is that emptiness in my heart that is the cause of feeling lonely not the amount of people around me.
-5	negative	loneliness	I pretend I'm okay but everyday I fake a smile making people think I'm so happy but really I'm not whenever people ask if I'm okay I just lie and say I'm fine
-2	negative	loneliness	I pretend to be ok cause if I say something's wrong they tell me to get over it or I'm bitching about something.  I don't tell my friends cause I don't know why I'm not ok but act like it.
-3	negative	loneliness	I ran away today. I've never felt so betrayed. Hated. Unwanted and alone. I'm just hoping to get away from it all. 
-2	negative	loneliness	I really don't have a lot of friends I can talk to. I'd love to make some, a message is always nice.  I haven't been talking to anyone lately /:
-5	negative	loneliness	I really don't like to have a military boyfriend and I promised to myself not too, BEFORE.. but then I found myself falling in love with a military man and it's indescribably perfect kinds of Love. I love Him so much and I trust Him..  
-1	negative	loneliness	I really do the title says it all. One thing can  just tick me off
-4	negative	loneliness	I Really Miss You Schatzchen  I realized the mistakes I made in the past and hurting you was the biggest mistake I ever made. Through meditation and some serious soul searching the person I miss the most in my life is you schatzchen. I hope I am lucky enough and not to late to once again have you in my life. 
-4	negative	loneliness	i really need a friend i can talk to , i dont have anyone in mylife i can talk to openly , i need a good friend that accepts me for who i am , if there's anyone around my age interested in being my friend then that would be great 
-5	negative	loneliness	I really need some advice. I'm a freshman in college and I'm currently 1 week into the spring semester. The problem that I'm facing right now is that I'm not sure if I should keep my schedule how it currently is.  Should I drop calculus? My biggest fear is honestly what two of my closest friends might think of it, as they have both already taken multivariable calc, and done well in it. If there are any people in CS out there, do you feel that calc 3 is very important? I still am likely to take it in the future, but now doesn't seem like the right time.
-4	negative	loneliness	I really need someone to talk I have been feeling lonely for a long time. I have only one close friend, but now he's studying and working at the same time so it's hard to talk with him. I met an online friend some days ago and he became very special to me. Tonight he said he would go to a place where he couldn't have any contact with me again. My days were brightened with our conversations, but he's gone now I really wish he could still talk with me. I've been lonely most times of my life and I became used to it to an extent - some days I really miss someone to talk, to care about
-3	negative	loneliness	I really need someone who can listen I'm not in my best place right now please message me If u can talk..
-1	negative	loneliness	I really never have anyone to talk to around this time of night. (11:31 PM)  Anyone who can hold a conversation want to talk?
-5	negative	loneliness	I really really need someone to talk to before I lose my mind. I've been suffering for two months now due to the loss of my girlfriend. The pain has been eating me alive since. I can't talk to anyone because I can't trust anyone. Most of my friends take my feelings as a joke, my family just abuses me and I can't trust any other adult without them going to my family about it. You can check out my other stories, which revolve around me losing my girlfriend. I REALLY need someone to talk to before I end up possibly dealing damage to myself.
-5	negative	loneliness	I really refrain from saying I'm dating a solider or I'm a military girlfriend because I'm not. I know I post under this but I don't think I'm a military girl friend and im not dating a soldier.  Sorry for the rant
-5	negative	loneliness	I really thought he was going to propose tonight. I've cried about this several times now, so he definitely knows how much it hurts me.
-9	negative	loneliness	I really tried, it was like having a baby again. I rescued two baby Shih Tzu/ Llaso apso puppies. The mother of the baby had many complications due to the pregnancy. I really got attached to Bear and Gizmo. I loved the puppies. It was so hard and realize how important it is for a puppy to be with his mother. These puppies were the little runts of the litter. I'm so sad I was blessed to experience these joy but so hurt. I wish I could haves saved them. They both would have been two weeks tomorrow. 
-1	negative	loneliness	I really want someone to love me..
-4	negative	loneliness	I really want someone to talk or chat with about anything and everything. Please inbox. I just turned 22. IF you are in the same age range, that would be better. Thanks. 
-2	negative	loneliness	I really want to cry, but i feel like i have no more tears left.  I want someone to hold me.
-7	negative	loneliness	I really wish I had more in marriage then just waking up everyday doing the same thing every single day, not having someone to talk to. Having someone there that just says "yea" after telling how mess up ur day just was,  is there more  or is that just how marriage is at a point of your life! Having the feeling of going crazy cuz you start talking to your self about your day, butting yourself in the dirt everyday cuz there isn't anybody to pick u back up or knowing how u feel.. Not having someone to talk to is the worst!
-4	negative	loneliness	I really wish my baby was here with me  I want to feel his arms wrapped around me tight while he whispers I love you in my ear &lt;3
-1	negative	loneliness	I really wish my friend was on here so we can talk
-1	negative	loneliness	I really wish sometimes I could feel them. They make me smile when I get a cyber hug from my friends. *hugs* 
-5	negative	loneliness	I received more letters today  . Iv been running to my mailbox like a maniac every day waiting for these letters. i just needed to hear from him, it's been so long. They came at the perfect time because I was having a terrible day and it totally made me smile.. 
-5	negative	loneliness	I recently broke up with my boyfriend and I just wish I could run back to him and tell him sorry, but lately I feel like I try more in this relationship than he does. I go visit him, he hasn't visited in months I save up my money to buy him gifts and he's never bought me anything, I leave and he doesn't chase me. Does this mean I did a good thing in leaving him? Cause I don't feel like it was a good thing cause I miss him so much I miss talking to him the whole day and it's only been two days. Did I do the right thing? Someone message me or something I really need advice 
-7	negative	loneliness	I recently read on this site.. I recently didn't even know that diagnosed existed. This past August from 3 diff hospitalizations, from diff hospitals, EEG, EKGs, blood work, MRI ,Cat scan, Spinal taps. Nothing, everything came back normal. I am happy that I am back its a long recovery, but with the right medications and therapy, I am back I am even driving. It took me about a month. 
-9	negative	loneliness	I remember when I used to do the things I loved, when I used to smile all the time, when I had lots of friends that's I cared about and who also cared about mei was never popularpeople told me I was because of all the friends I had and all the things I did, but I never felt popular I felt like I was below everyone else that I was that girl people didnt take a second look ati was told by many people that I wasn't the girl who just sat in the back and never looked at but that I was that girl that was always looked at. I figured they just told me that because I was friends with but I never felt that way, ever, I've always felt like I put everyone before me. I was always so nice and I guess sometimes I felt used and stepped on. But I was always repaid for my kind actions. What's happening to me!!!???
-3	negative	loneliness	I resigned from my previous job because I was so sick then after 6 months I want to reapply again with the same company anyone can give me a smart  answer if the employer will ask me why would we hire you again?
-1	negative	loneliness	Is anyone else out there married and lonley?   I feel like I'm living with a complete stranger sometimes. 
-2	negative	loneliness	I sat by myself at lunch today. I had plenty of friends at my old school but now my social life is a complete 0. I try to open myself up to people but they don't seem to respond. It's very lonely
-4	negative	loneliness	I see all my friends happy with their boyfriends and I feel like I'm missing out. I know that when my time comes for a boyfriend it will. I just can't help but feel this way. :/ >Waiting Patiently&lt; *I know I'm young, I know I shouldn't rush love, I know it'll come simply stating how I feel* 
-3	negative	loneliness	I see a lot of girls calling their Marine, "Soldier".. Marines are not soldiers. They are simply Marines.. 
-5	negative	loneliness	I see bullying everyday  to some kid in my class but I never get bullied because I could beat up every kid in my class even boys but I'm to shy and babyish to say anything but I was bullied one time but I beat the crap out of that boy but now were friends
-4	negative	loneliness	i seem to always have to explain alot to prople it makes me frustrated i was always silenced by people now im kinda rude i have pt sd and post traumatic stress disorder my mind plays horrible memories feelings and im not able to rest.feedback welcomed
-2	negative	loneliness	I seem to have more people lying to me.. :/ they are like "oh no I haven't been talking to anyone, check my fb if u don't believe me" *logs into their fb account* 5 new messages.. Well well well what a surprise. Sick of being lied to. :/
-3	negative	loneliness	I see people in relationships everywhere.  Walking down the street, at work, etc.  All I want is the same thing.  I want someone to hold hands with when out and about.  Someone to cuddle with.  Someone to hold.  Someone to kiss.  Someone to talk to and listen to.  Someone to come home to.  Someone to wake up next to.  Someone we can be open and honest with together.  Someone looking for a real, true and long term relationship.  Am I asking too much? based on the fact I can't find anyone wanting this, I'm thinking it is.
-5	negative	loneliness	I self taught myself screamo because I think metal (no matter what type) is beautiful music with such strong meaning. And I am so aggressive and have no control of my anger so I use this method to let it out. And it helps instead of being physically violent I could either try to write a song, or scream asking alexandria.
-5	negative	loneliness	I sent a package of important documents to Hawaii by Priority Air Mail from southern California. It got delivered 2 weeks later because it was shipped by Ocean freight!! I asked how it could happen and asked for a refund and was told that Priority Mail is not really guaranteed 2-3 days delivery. So no refund, even though someone obviously made a mistake by placing it on the wrong bin.
-1	negative	loneliness	I seriously have a problem. I really hate being alone. It's not that I can't be, but I strongly dislike it. I'm overall scared to be alone with my own thoughts, or at least that's what I think the reason is
-1	negative	loneliness	Is it weird if your girlfriend is 2 years younger then yourself? Because i am 18 atm and my girlfriend is 16??
-1	negative	loneliness	Is it wrong for me to want someone to love. Someone to hold my hand, tell me I'm pretty and actually think that. Someone to I can late night convos with and sends me morning texts. Is that so wrong for me to want?
-7	negative	loneliness	Isn't it amazing how life works sometimes works. I spent the last few years of my marriage so lonely. Now, that I am getting a divorce the loneliness I felt has been replaced with silence and a wonder. I wonder if I will find someone, yet I don't know when I will be ready to open my heart again. I just know that I would rather feel this physical loneliness than the emotional one I lived in for years.
-13	negative	loneliness	Isn't it amazing how we can be motivated/inspired/depressed etc by music? Look at how the artist can speak and relate to us by  just saying words that hit us to our core. Sometimes we don't even need lyrics . While most if us listen to different genres to broaden our musical kaleidoscope some stay in their comfort zone. Now whether it's the former or latter that defines you here's the similarity we filter the music and pick what we like. I think the same should be done when it comes to choosing whom we talk to. I'm pretty sure you can determine the perverts, the charmers etc.Whatever you came on this app to find make it a search first and that's how I'm hoping to find the right people in my circle. Those who can't comprehend what I just wrote probably have automatically filtered out themselves
-2	negative	loneliness	I sometimes go through a faze of not talking all day in primary school in year 5 I didn't speak for a year!!!! not even a word or a whisper!!!!
-6	negative	loneliness	I sometimes lay in bed listening to my music, close my eyes, and pretend someone is next to me. It's sad because I am not alone I just feel it. Everyone I can physically be around right now makes me feel empty. I think I've come to romanticize everything that romance has become the only way I see myself not feeling alone. But that also scares me because I've done the -completely dependent/a part of your other half- that when you're left alone you don't know who you are anymore. It's not a mistake I want to repeat.
-3	negative	loneliness	I spend a lot of time in my room because I'm tired of pretending to happy. In my room I can just listen to music and ignore everyone else
-2	negative	loneliness	Is there anyone 30-50 who would like to chat?
-1	negative	loneliness	is there any other jail wives/girlfriends out there?
-6	negative	loneliness	i still wonder why people turn away from me all the tym? nd i end up on the bed alone in my roomif u help ppl they take u fr granted and if u dnt u r egoisticso i feel ts beetr alone thn being in wit thos who dnt respect u..bt in my bedroom its so lonely!!
-3	negative	loneliness	I suffer from mild anxiety and panic attacks when I am at school. My main triggers seem to be when some one is hurt or in pain (physically or emotionally) or in class if we are learning about something (eg hitler and the holocaust) that means people die or is upsetting. My class mates seem to be disturbed by this but not overly distressed.   I know my best friends are worried about me but I can't seem to want to eat at school, sure I'm hungry, I'm positively starving. But I'm so fat already, I don't need food.
-7	negative	loneliness	I surround myself around my friends and I enjoy going out and doing somethingBut when those times are not around to keep me up all the time I shut myself away. I had dated a girl for 2 years Some of the best and roughest times were with her. Even though I am over her, I miss talking to someone about the darker times I go through and those darker days happen quite often. I don't want anyone to save me but just someone there. Almost like when you and a loved one sit there and just stare at each other and talk. The comforting feeling that comes from that is the feeling I get talking to someone late at night when I am alone. Those are the best momentsI take one step at a time toward the avoidance of being lonely but it is always there. People relate to me but I won't let them. At the same time I want them to just read me like an open book
-1	negative	loneliness	I talk with everyone just message me
-3	negative	loneliness	It doesn't matter how many people I'm with I always feel lonely, nobody seems to understand me and the ones who start to always leave me, every time I feel someone starting to get me they pretend like I never existed, which makes me think maybe there's something wrong with me
-3	negative	loneliness	I tend to rely on others to make me happy. Letting go of someone and moving on is so painful and lonely. Even when you know it's the right thing to do. How do I find the strength? How do I find happiness within myself?
-1	negative	loneliness	I text a message and then turn over the phone, anxious for a reply and dreading the outcome
-1	negative	loneliness	It feels like I am invisible. No one notices me and it gels like they don't care. And if that's it, then what can I do to get noticed? Everyone around me seems to have someone special in their heart that they care about and I doesn't seem fair. Not being able to share how I feel. To know that someone will be thee for me and won't judge me for what I have done and gone through. I can't help it anymore than you can. I feel so depressed and secluded. The toll in my emotions is immense.
-2	negative	loneliness	It feels like nobody could see me. I'm trying hard to be likeable person. I don't have any friends, or anyone I could trust. My family doesn't know that I'm depressed. I'm crying everyday. I'm hopeless, I don't know what to do. I'm not sure is there anyone in this world who would accept me as I am. 
-5	negative	loneliness	It feels like we drifted apart. We stay in seperate rooms when hes home from work. At night we lay in bed together but he always falls asleep cause he says hes tired from working. I can understand that. But he coukd find time for us. Our daughter doesnt want anything to do with her dad.
-23	negative	loneliness	It has been 4 1/2 years since my son passed away.  I decided to make some major changes in my life. I have moved from southern California to the state of Washington. This is where my son's son, my grandson, now lives and I intend to stay as close to him as possible. My grandson seems to appreciate my being nearby and I'm pretty sure my son would approve.: ) I continue to miss and pray formy son everyday. But I have decided to take care of my health and to enjoy whatever time I have left on Earth. I have not experienced the death of anyclose friends or familyrecently (knock wood) and that helps.Parker's death still hurts. Istill cry for him. But Iknow I will see him again one day, when it is my time. Until then, I pray, I think of him, I miss him, I know he is with God and I know he is watching over his son and me. That's all I can ask for. 
-3	negative	loneliness	It has been four years since I last saw my grandma. Except for that one time, last summer, when I saw her in my dreams that she was brought back to life. -have a little faith by Mitch Albom
-12	negative	loneliness	It has been quite some time since I have been on here. A lot of new faces, that's for sure. I am a Army wife and living in Hawaii now. Even though I'm married and living with my husband, it still gets lonely at times being so far from home, family, and friends.  I have my new beauty product line now that I will be posting the website and YouTube channel about very soon. I give the gfs and fiances of military a discount not just wives that are married. I was once a gf and fianc waiting faithfully and patient for my man and I know the roller coaster of emotions that happen. Sooooo stay tuned for the information. As usual if anyone needs a friend to talk or advice feel free to message me anytime. Hope everyone has had a wonderful start to the new year! 
-1	negative	loneliness	It has not been warm here since Thursday.  Our city has shut down and I am lonely and cold
-12	negative	loneliness	I think I like this girl in school. In my first year of school, I met her in this club I joined. But I didn't had the chance to talk to her. The most was just saying hi and bye. But since she quitted whenever i see her, we just walk past each other not saying anything. But I always got this feel, like nervous or something when I see her. But we're graduating soon, and I'm afraid that I won't be able to see her again. I'm an introvert and I'm really bad at starting conversations and continuing it. What should I do
-4	negative	loneliness	I think I might end up alone. Cause my relationships don't last.  something always  goes bad and we end up breaking up
-1	negative	loneliness	I think of depression is you thinking of your self of the lowest person on earth and seem not to make friends.
-3	negative	loneliness	I think the hardest part is realizing how utterly alone I am in my own head.
-13	negative	loneliness	I think the hardest part of living each day is not knowing a true answer to why my son passed away. He was always such a healthy baby at each appt, always moving around. We enjoyed seeing him on 3D/4D and got an amazing video of him. Living each and every day with the thought that my body failed me, is killing me. I truly believe that they let me go to long and my son was to big for my body. He weighed in at a big 10lbs 2 oz and 22in long. Each day I went for an appt in the last 4 weeks they would say next week they will induce you and than just kept putting it off. I blame the doctors a lot for this and that I didn't get to see the same doctor each week. We have been waiting over 4 months now for autopsy results that were done on 6/11/13 when he passed. We just feel there must not be anything to find and that they will probably come back unconvulsive. 
-3	negative	loneliness	I think true love dances on that line of foolishness and stupidity far more than one could be comfortable. As helpful as using your mind would be when leaving yourself that vulnerable, when you are truly in love, you mind will have very little to nothing at all to do with it. As love, itself, is a totally illogical emotion.  
-8	negative	loneliness	I think we all just want someone just like us, that already knows and understands everything. We're alone in our head, in our experiences, in our reality. I just want someone that KNOWS. No one knows what's in my head.
-5	negative	loneliness	I think we should all consider things that diverge us from people who enclose us in our every day universe. Why do we really feel isolated and alone? How are you dissimilar from compact people in your life? Here is my judgements towards my self. I feel releasing actuality about me to complete strangers (who I adore, you guys are amazing!) fulfilling. I enjoy you guys taking occasions out of your day to hear me rant. &lt;3
-9	negative	loneliness	I thought I was going to do it this time.. I sat on the edge of my bed, pills in my hand, crying. I had a really bad day, just like every other. There's this guy, at school. I think I like him. He's really the only person (apart from my little 'friend' group) that talks to me. He's so sweet and funny. He doesn't judge anyone, by looks or anything.  Thanks for reading to the end! It really means a lot to know that someone wants to hear my story&lt;3
-15	negative	loneliness	It is I don't know why I'm writing this. Maybe because lately I've felt lonely. I have an amazing boyfriend. He's so sweet and so good to me. I remember when we talked about going different places. He's in culinary school, and I mean what better way to learn then going to travel. He got an offer to work at a restaraunt his friends are opening. He'd be very important to the kitchen you see. And he can't go places with me anymore. And I ask and I know the answer. He can't do those things anymore. I have no right to say he should go with me or do things with me. And his life seems set now, you know, he gonna be ready to just be calm. I just can't slow down. I don't wang to do things without him. I feel like I'm gonna have to. It's ok though. I don't want to be selfish. He needs to live his dream. I just don't feel like I'm gonna be a part of it, like sooner or later ill be more lonely then I already now. I refuse to pull him down though.
-1	negative	loneliness	It is really wonderful because our love is so much more stronger and meaningful then a normal relationships. 
-9	negative	loneliness	I told my ex I wanted to talk. We supposed to meet tonight. I'm not gunna lie. I thought I was going to marry this girl. I still want her. But I think her mind is made & I don't know if I have even a slim chance. She told me she has no desire to be with n she deserves better. Should I even go? Or just not even show up
-1	negative	loneliness	I totaled my car today and it's ruined my life
-2	negative	loneliness	It really hurts. It's hard to express the feeling - it's like a lead weight in your chest. You feel hopeless and tired. 
-2	negative	loneliness	It really is possible to feel lonely in a crowded room. It's like there's this thin shield separating me from the rest of the world. Does this sound melodramatic?
-6	negative	loneliness	It recently hit me again how lonely I actually am. I have only 2 friends in my real life and they live in another state so I guess technically it's really only me here. I talk to people at work sometimes sure but they're too drugged up for me to associate with outside of my job so it's been a struggle to make and keep friends lately. I would really like to meet some new friends be it in real life or at the very least on here .
-1	negative	loneliness	I truly do. I like the escape, because I'm usually alone all the time. Sigh.
-7	negative	loneliness	I try not to moan and complain. I try not to be so negative but it just isn't that easy, I'm going to try be factual and not complain and moan. My brother is in prison, my mum and I have a strained relationship she blames me for a lot, I blame myself too, but I blame her aswell, I have a lot of conflict in my head. I have aspergers and bi-polar, it's all a bit much sometimes, I also have musculo-skeletal chronic pain syndrome, although I'm having further tests as it may be Complex Regional Pain Syndrome In other words either way I'm always in pain and sometimes it's so bad I pass out It gets old really quick, and considering I'm 18 it's quite hard to explain to my friends why I keep passing out Some days I think I'm beautiful, and other days I look at myself and feel sick, like I want to smash the mirror I don't know what my point is, but that's my life at the moment, and I'm still trying not to moan, I'm sure others have had it worse and are having worse times
-18	negative	loneliness	I try to always remember them both happy ,there laughter anduunending energy. But sometimes I can't help but think about how they died. The crooner swears they didn't suffer. But how can that be true? The boat capsized,caught in a horrific unpredicted storm. Did they know they were going to drown,did they struggle to survive? What horrors did they endure? Was my brother able to comfort them? Was he holding them close at the end? Or did it all end fast and swiftly? I pray that it happened to fast or at the very least my brother was with them holding them until the end. Sometimes these thoughts haunt me and I can't get them out of my mind.
-4	negative	loneliness	It's a foe of mine something I battle with. Although I'm not actully lonely now I do find the scars from it do not heal. The weight gain does not just drop off. The self harming does not die in the mind. As human beings we are highly sociable. But my circles all use/d drugs. Even the ones who have great jobs and who look as though butter wouldn't melt! So I'm off drugs I'm happy I live alone. It's hard, I muddle through. I can't have a relationship. I argue a lot. And just now and again lonleiness bites. It hurts! But it's not as bad as it was.
-10	negative	loneliness	It's always been a fear of mine.  When I was really young I worried that I'd end up alone because I was awkward and unattractive.  I guess the fear stuck with me.  It doesn't scare me as bad as it used to.  Being in a bad marriage has made me wonder if maybe being alone wouldn't be so bad, but the thought of it is still scary.  I really want to have a family to come home to at night, and I long for someone to love who will show me he loves me back and wants me in his life long term.  I have this horrible fear that if I manage to leave my marriage and go in search of a happier life I'll never find it.  It is probably completely irrational, but I fear that happiness will always evade me and I will end up dying alone.  
-2	negative	loneliness	It's always hard explaining how I feel on the inside. I always seem to come back to feel real loneliness even when nothing is real wrong in my life. I wish I knew where this feeling came from.  I'm not sure if I'm venting or just restless but this feeling is not good.
-1	negative	loneliness	It's always nice to have someone to whom you can talk to without being judged.
-5	negative	loneliness	It's amazing how things can always have a turn for the worst.  I almost never resort to this, I'm not mentioning it on this post so look at my past posts. I guess I was ment to deal with this myself.    When you help, it makes things better.  But when you ask for it to the same people, you can't get it.
-9	negative	loneliness	Its an awful awful feeling and something i don't want to feel but i just can t help. About a year ago my husband took a job out of state. So we moved with our three kids. I thought it would be okay and i turned out to be so wrong. Ive done nothing but cry and have anxiety, i don't know who i am anymore and i just want to move back home to my family. Im honestly figuring irrational thoughts in my head just to move back. I hate this and i am tired of being sad all the time. On top of it my husband thinks i should be fine and hasn't been very supportive. i want to go home
-4	negative	loneliness	It's a sad realisation when you know you will always be alone. There is no one out there for you to share your life with.
-3	negative	loneliness	It's awesome that a group of complete strangers can all come together to support one another, sometimes even more than your own family; I needed this group and I appreciate everyone of you!
-13	negative	loneliness	it's been 16 years since my brother committed suicide I believe that my late brother hasn't left me completely, he's my guardian angel. One winter I was driving and someone told me "go straight" so I did. As I was driving my vehicle went sideways - I started crying because I noticed the trucks behind me were gone, they decided to drive up the hill before I went sideways.
-6	negative	loneliness	It's been 3 months, and I have 9 more. I hate being without him. I can say, completely confidently, he is the only person who makes me feel worth anything. I go through everyday being told what I'm awful at. He made everything better, and still just hearing from them makes it all worth while. But days like today, it just hurts..
-1	negative	loneliness	It's been a day and I can't stop thinking about my boyfriend since I spend every day with him when he was still here , it makes it harder on me but I can only imagine how he's feeling
-1	negative	loneliness	It's Been A While  As she walked away i grabbed her arm and told her to stay. i said "You're not pretty, you're beautiful. I don`t want to be with you forever, I need to be with you forever. And I wouldn't cry if you walked away, I would die." 
-6	negative	loneliness	It's been a while i proposed a girl and she rejected me . and my friend asked me why i'm not sad ; i answered him : why should i be sad ? i have lost someone who didn't love me but she's lost someone who loved her 
-5	negative	loneliness	It's been two weeks not even and it drives me crazy four months and even after that it's two weeks together then 3 and a half years of being apart. Unless he pops the question.. I feel for any other girl going threw this .. Its hard.. Not seeing them hearing their voice them not holding you when you need them most It's the worst feeling in the world. Knowing their going threw somthing you won't ever really and truely understand not being able to be there for them every night pat their back hold them tell them everything's going to be ok .. Nothing's hurt this bad..love is the worst but it's absolute perfection at that
-3	negative	loneliness	It scares me how much time I end up talking to myself and how bad I am with talking with others
-25	negative	loneliness	It's days like today that make me miss him so much. I have to drive an hour and a half away to handle some business and my anxiety goes off if I go far from home. Sometimes I'm okay, others I'm not.  I've never understood why I react that way. It's not easy. If he were here he'd say, "Come on babes, let's get it done and over with. I'll be right there with you. We'll get dinner and watch movies when we get home. What are you in the mood for?" I can almost hear his voice. This is just another reminder that he's not here to be my strength and help me through the hard times. I know that what he goes through is so much worse so the things I worry about on a daily basis pale in comparison. So I'm going to gain strength from that and do what I have to do. It may be hard but I have to learn how to get through things myself without him here and I know he'll be so proud of me. 
-3	negative	loneliness	It seems a lot of people post here. I understand what many are feeling.  I don't want to rely on my girlfriend completely and want to show her that I can make friends.
-4	negative	loneliness	it seems like i'm surrounding by bodies not souls.. i scream and no one listens I said i need help they just laughed.. my friends don't even care all they care about is their guys.  
-2	negative	loneliness	It seems like I'm the worst at making friends, or even creating conversation for that matter. I'm partly shy, but the main thing is I just can't think of anything to keep the conversation going. I would like to find more friends and start a meetup to be more social. I feel depressed because I am always alone. I am in NW Ohio if anyone is near
-10	negative	loneliness	It seems that everybody I once called my friend have left me..all they wanna do is party every weekend or whenever their isn't school. They would ditch me for other people and not even invite me with to anything. It's gotten so bad that even my best friend has been starting to call me things that everybody would call me when i got bullied and all that. She always walks up and tells me that I look like I'm pregnant . She is really been making me mad lately and I don't wanna lose my last friend :/
-10	negative	loneliness	It's endemic in this area! If you've ever been to Europe, you'll know old towns are full of tight bends and narrow streets. There you go round a corner and what do you see in your path? A car some idiot decided to park where it is not safe and not permitted!I can understand a badly parked delivery van. If you've got a tight schedule and deliver things for a living, carrying heavy stuff from the parking lot may not be a pleasant thing to do. Work is work. But there's no excuse for other cases. Especially when a lazily parked car will slow down or stop emergency vehicles.
-8	negative	loneliness	It's funny. My solider has been away at army boot camp for the past 3 weeks and in those 3 weeks I've received nothing but love, support and well wishes from both our friends and even acquaintances talking about how in love we are and that they see marriage as a definite in our future. My soldier's friends check up on me daily, take me out to keep me occupied on weekends. My love's mom who's in Germany and sister that's in Taiwan keep up with me almost daily.  Nothing beats my soldier's love though. 49 days till graduation!! &lt;3
-3	negative	loneliness	Its good thing being alone you have your own experience but being lonely is quite depressing and sad!! I think everyone should have they own space but never get too lonely it's not a nice feeling.
-3	negative	loneliness	It's hard for me to make friends cus of the way I am ppl say I'm a geek or they say I'm to short to jump and hit the doorway so ppl an rent always happy around me and when I do try to make friends I get hurt cus they hurt me in ways I can't explain
-5	negative	loneliness	It's hard trying to accept the fact that you and someone you planned to marry won't be together. Lol I've dated before but this really hurts.
-5	negative	loneliness	It's hard when you have friends and are surrounded by a lot of people with whom you can laugh and talk but none of them to communicate your deepest thoughts. Thoughts that keeps you preoccupied most of the time. And to make an attempt to introduce a matter that is deep and somehow philosophical makes the situation rather awkward, and with an obvious effort on their part to steer away from the topic. 
-2	negative	loneliness	It's highly unlikely you just can't replicate my weirdness awesomeness and insanity  But I would  like to know
-9	negative	loneliness	It's his birthday again. Last year at this time I remember our feast at home, celebrating his 67th and last birthday. Now that he's been gone for 11 months. When I was in my room surfing the net I heard my grandma playing the Happy Birthday song on the piano. I was astonished. She never remembers her own birthday when she remembers her husband's. Sorrow in my heart Grandpa is my most beloved relative and he brought me up, and I just want him to come back. :-(
-4	negative	loneliness	It's like physically I'm not but mentally and emotionally I am alone. Alone with my madness and my thoughts while the whole world keeps moving and I'm detached from time. It's scary.
-3	negative	loneliness	Its my boyfriends first week of tec school in the Air Force. we fought the whole week. He was home for the holidays and did not fight once. Does it take time to get used to this?
-6	negative	loneliness	It's not easy talking to my parents. Especially when their negative about everything. I don't tell you what's going on, because you don't listen. You just put more weight on the pain I'm already feeling. Why don't I talk to friends? What friends.
-5	negative	loneliness	It's not even that I want a relationship necessarily. It just seems as though everyone has a 'best friend' or a really close group of friends, that's all I want really. Well, it would be nice.
-5	negative	loneliness	It's not like I don't have friends at all, I've got some friends, but I still feel lonely. I feel like I can't be my real self in front of them, only about some specific topics, because they can be really judgmental sometimes, and it makes me crazy! I feel like I can't open up with anyone! I am so grateful I found EP, here I can talk about my feelings and open up, and no one is going to judge me.
-2	negative	loneliness	It's not often I crave the presence of another, but when I do it's like a drug I'm addicted to.
-1	negative	loneliness	Its not that i am an abandoned person with no one to love me.i have people care for me..and i m extremely grateful for that.. I just wish that i was able to fit in with them..then i guess i wouldnt feel so alone sometimes.
-6	negative	loneliness	It's not that I would say I'm super worried about being Lonely cause I know somebody will come into my life and fix that but when you no longer are friends with somebody you have talked to all night and all day for a year and shared stories and laughed and went through a lot together you kind of feel lonely when you leave them and no longer have that anymore.
-1	negative	loneliness	It's safer for you. There is little else to say about that.
-1	negative	loneliness	It's so hard watching myself give up on everything I've ever wanted. It's even harder watching myself give up on myself. But the hardest is knowing I won't make it much longer, because theres just no way I can live like this anymore.
-2	negative	loneliness	It's so sad how people who promised would be there for you suddenly disappear ! They take away all your secrets and pretend to never have known you before :/
-14	negative	loneliness	It's true but the reality of it all is that I don't have a true friend. I don't have a best friend who can share my problems, who can understand what I mean even if I can't put the words together correctly. Am I asking to much by saying I want a bestfriend in my life? Someone who is like me and isn't afraid to take risks and travel the world. I have plenty of friends but they aren't people to tell secrets too, I can trust ten but I want to reach someone on a personal level. To know that I'm there for them and vice versa. Share the same music and oils enjoy staying up all night and talking about life and our worries. Someone to text though out the day someone to finally text me first and make me feel like I'm worth something to them. Someone to never abandoned me and just be good friends. But it's been a couple years now and I realize that maybe I am being to selective and should settle for acquaintances. Thank you for sticking through this long whiny post I love you
-1	negative	loneliness	It's true, I am lonely. I feel like I'm going insane due to the fact that I haven't had a real, genuine conversation in months. If anyone out there can lend a hand, please do. Thanks. 
-2	negative	loneliness	its weirdbut im always around fake peoplei need someone real and that actually cares about me
-5	negative	loneliness	its weird.. has anyone else had this problem? where they feel so alone.. yet they are around so many people.. so yes i just went through a break up. i havent slept alone in forever.. ive always had someone to share my bed with.. i now have a friend who comes a cuddles me sometimes. but when hes not here im hurting.. im so alone.. :/ 
-5	negative	loneliness	It's weird, there are nice people out there, and I can relate to them. But we don't really have a close connection, and I haven't met anyone that could be a really good friend. It's always a sort of "hi" and "bye" relationship, if that makes sense. If you can understand what I'm saying and would like to make friends, message me.
-7	negative	loneliness	Its when I'm saddest, and feeling like pouring my eyes out, that I'm the most gung ho. This is why you see me traveling worlds away and conquering demons. That's why I embrace the pain in my heart.
-5	negative	loneliness	It was 2 months ago. I was at my monthly gum scaling for my gum disease. Well this time my dentist decided to not numb me. As I cried he cut my gums. Not cool bro.
-10	negative	loneliness	It was the first time that I got scared being left behind. My sister just started her family, my father just died, my mother is living far away, and my brother having a life of his own. I thought being alone is good; for some time, it is, but it was lonely you'll ask yourself, "how about me?"
-13	negative	loneliness	it was very unexpected. we weren't planning on having a child. i got pregnant though. and not long after i had a miscarriage. at first i was speechless. i didn't know what to do. as the day went on it sunk in and i just felt horrible and worthless. though it wasn't planned it still really hurt to lose the child. i told my partner and he was just shocked. he helped make me feel better though. it was nice for me that he was there and i could share with him what it felt like. i know that some part of me will always feel the pain and what it was like. i will always wonder about what the child would have been like. i just wanted to share what it was like for me. this is my experience.
-1	negative	loneliness	It would be nice to find someone who understands and not only tells me it's ok or get over it.
-3	negative	loneliness	It would be nice to have a best girl friend to talk to on here, and eventually become texting buddies. I feel like I have no one to relate to me. Pretty much all of the experiences I have on here are who I am in a nutshell.
-2	negative	loneliness	It would be nice to have someone to talk/chat withthing is I'm not sure about what.if that makes sense.
-4	negative	loneliness	I understand why she's doing it. It's probably an uncomfortable feeling, being liked by someone you don't like back. But that she's avoiding me now makes me feel as if I'm being punished for having the gall to like someone. Again. I have so much love to give, but nobody wants it
-1	negative	loneliness	I used to be passionate and lived for achievements. Now that I'm about to graduate from a top university, with a job lined up, I don't know what to live for anymore. Work, money, recognition all seem so meaningless now.
-5	negative	loneliness	I used to be such a happy person and suddenly, it felt like I had no one and my life just simply crumbled around me Message me please, and if you feel the same, I'd be happy to listen for you as well 
-2	negative	loneliness	I used to get close to people quickly now I don't, the fear of being blissfully happy installs fear and dread inside me incase it's taken from me again.
-12	negative	loneliness	I use to do it and looking back at old messages, I can't even read them. I have trouble reading other people's messages when they use text speak. What is so hard about taking an extra second to type properly? I'm not talking about typos I'm talking about whn ppl tlk lik ths bc thy to lzy to typ out wrds and whn thy use ur. Took me 2 minutes to type that. It makes people look uneducated. When someone messages me and says "how was ur day" I automatically think "great an idiot" I probably am too judgmental but it's very annoying. Speak the bloody queens English!!!
-1	negative	loneliness	I usually am with other people, but I don't feel like I can really connect to any of them, they all just seem distant to me. I can't find anyone I can relate to.
-9	negative	loneliness	I usually just go to school and concentrate on my classes and then go straight to work. But I don't like being sad because I feel alone. My mom always tells me that I'm not alone and that the most important thing that I have is family which is like my cousins. But it's weird I don't really talk to anybody and nobody texts me or even calls me to see how I'm doing. I feel like I am alone even when I'm not.
-8	negative	loneliness	I value my family more than anything in this world. But when I meet people who I can relate to, I feel like they are part of my family. I recently met someone with whom I relate so much to that it feels like we are siblings. Indeed, blood doesn't make a family, because well, sometimes its them who enjoy to see you suffering.
-4	negative	loneliness	I've always felt alone. Even at times with a crowd of friends, I still am alone within myself. I function within this world but don't feel I'm a part of it.
-3	negative	loneliness	I've always generally enjoyed time alone, I've never been that interested in social gatherings or the like, I prefer spending time on my own things. However I must admit I do have problems with loneliness, not so much for the lack of contact with people, more for the lack of connection I have with people, even my own family. Been this way for at least ten years now.  That being said I did become friends with someone a good few months ago who has helped ease that sense of loneliness, I still feel it from time to time, it's unavoidable really. I have very little wish to speak of my own loneliness to anyone really, even my friend. I don't wish to burden them with it nor scare them away when ever it hits me.
-9	negative	loneliness	I've always had a path of competitive female friends which always undermined my self confidence via my trust in them, now I've got no friends but a living boyfriend but no girlfriends to chat & coffee with.Im sad that it's come to this , but at times I expect other women to have a higher understanding about being loyal to each other and that's why I tend to tire easily with them, & lose interest in perusing a friendship.Im 39 & over it ! , though I still would like to make new friends & be hurt by the competition & bitchiness women impose on each other as a "survival" tactic .Though I'm confused by where the threat actually comes from in the first place, could be anything.~Sheesh
-10	negative	loneliness	I've always had to be independent because my mom abandoned me at a young age and that gave me trust issues so I've always been scared to get close to people because I get hurt but I have so much bottled up inside I have to let it out and I need someone to talk to that would understand me. So if your up for being friends maybe close friends just talking and venting message me, I'd really appreciate it  God bless, love y'all!
-2	negative	loneliness	I've been a full time mom since my 8 month old son was born. Now i have to go back to University, i dont want to leave my baby behind. What must i do???
-4	negative	loneliness	I've been chatting with a woman online for several months. Recently she asked if we could meet in person and I said no . Now she won't respond to any of my messages. I told her I was married when we first met. Not sure what to do now. I really enjoyed chatting with her and I do miss her.
-2	negative	loneliness	I've been depressed for 2 years. I have friends but nobody to really talk to. I have nobody.
-3	negative	loneliness	I've been depressed for the past week. I'm getting fed up with my life and the stupid mistakes I've made. I seem to make everyone in the world mad. I feel so alone. I just want someone to listen to me. I've been dealing with problems for too long. I feel like I'm going to end my life soon.
-4	negative	loneliness	I've been feeling lonely inside but I try to be okay even though I'm not , I don't have a big family either so there just me my dad mom and my sisters . All my friends are online and they come and go , they never stay . Idk what to do I have problem socializing with ppl , but I want to have a best friend
-8	negative	loneliness	I've been going through a lot lately, broken heart, struggling in school, worried about the future. Most of the time when I'm around people I'm completely fine, I laugh and act normal and more importantly I feel okay, sometimes even great. But when I'm alone, it all comes rushing in, especially the breakup and the stress, and I feel like I have no one, like no one cares and like I'm completely alone. Because of this I've been trying to be around people as much as possible, but it just isn't possible sometimes and those times are horrible.
-2	negative	loneliness	I've been in a relationship and she broke my heart
-5	negative	loneliness	I've been living with my boyfriend for almost a year now. I went snooping though his computer today, and long story short I found out his initial interest in me was only because my name is the same as the hottest girl that went to his high school.
-7	negative	loneliness	I've been lonely and struggling with extreme depression for almost 9 years, I'm lonely because I've never had a girlfriend before never even been kissed or cuddled with a girl. As I listen to old love songs on Pandora every night Frankie Avalon, Everly brothers, I just long for a girl to hold in my arms give a kiss on her neck and tell her that I love her. Being lonely is the most soul destroying emotion I've ever experienced and every day is a challenge. Whenever I see a couple in public holding hands and look happy it's like someone tears my heart out of my chest and a deep sadness overcomes me and have to go somewhere private before I cry, I cry like a baby all the time but I can't help it always because I'm longing for the company of a girl.
-1	negative	loneliness	I've been lonely for a while now, but only recently has it really started to get to me. I haven't had a boyfriend since High school, and I don't see myself being ready for one in the near future, no matter how much I would like to. Emotionally I'm a wreck. I've switched majors a ton of times, dropped out of school, started up again, dropped out. I honestly have no clue what I want to do with my life, and I feel like I'm not good enough for anyone right now. I have a few close friends, but I feel like I can't talk to them about how I feel because they won't understand. They're already married with kids, and are only in their early 20s, like myself.       There's just a harshness in people that frightens me, and my heart can't take rejection. I feel weak right now, but hopefully that will change. 
-3	negative	loneliness	I've been married for more than 10 years now. Last year was rough but now we are trying to work through it. The only thing that keeps me here is my family.
-5	negative	loneliness	I've been out of college for a year and a half now and moved to different state after graduation for work.  I thought this would be a great growing experience for me to go out on my own.  But after all this time I feel so alone.  I've made some friends, but we're not that close.  It's not like in college when I had my friends around me constantly.  And no one here gets me and I feel like a loser with no social life.  Does anyone else have a similar issue?  What can I do?
-2	negative	loneliness	I've been rejected many, many times By strangers, by friends, by family But I'm still afraid of it I guess I shouldn't but I am and I don't know how to act when people reject me and I'm so confused because there are so many things I did get used to but this isn't one of them.
-4	negative	loneliness	I've been single my whole life, not because I wanted to but because no one has ever been interested in dating me. It's caused some really serious problems because not being able to date made me feel like I couldn't be friends with people who date. I've lost friends that way and now I feel like I won't ever date and I don't think I even want to anymore but I still don't think I can ever be friends with people who are dating or married.
-2	negative	loneliness	ive been the one to love, the one to stay back and bleed. the one to care and the one who would believe im gona take whats mine , by blood and strength if need be
-4	negative	loneliness	I've been thinking about suicide much more recently. My suicidal thoughts never seem to go away entirely. They'll fade for a while giving me hope that I'm getting better, but then they come back and are worse than last time. I have no doubt that I'll kill myself within a year.
-4	negative	loneliness	i've been thinking and i found that i am so selfish, rude and arrogantno wonder why most people dont like me.
-2	negative	loneliness	I've been through a lot in my life and sometimes, just talking to someone helps me out 
-2	negative	loneliness	I've extinguished our flame, I tell myself: i'd rather be cold and lonely.
-1	negative	loneliness	I've gone through some pretty crazy relationships and idk don't think I'm good enough for anyone..
-3	negative	loneliness	I've had a terrible day.. Sometimes being lonely and having nobody to talk to at night really makes it worse I'm falling back into depression I guess.. I feel pathetic.. But it's the truth I can't stand feeling lonely I wish a woman cared.,,. I've been told by girls and exes I'm an amazing guy good looking and talented Maybe I'm just closing myself off too much
-12	negative	loneliness	I've had emetophobia for probably around 7 years now. It was just 2 years ago that I found out this fear had a name. Now I know I'm not alone and not a freak like all my friends and family have called me for years. im so eager to talk about it because I've never met anyone with the same crippling fear and barrier in their life. I'm hoping talking about it with others will calm my anxiety, which has gotten so bad that I have 1 or 2 panic attacks every single day. (not only from this fear, but I believe emetophobia has made fearful of many other things as well) I just have so much to get out that I've never been able to.
-1	negative	loneliness	I've just been feeling quite empty and alone lately, which usually isn't me.
-15	negative	loneliness	I've just joined up with experience in the hopes that I meet some girls like me who go through what I'm going through (and to have a good moan lol!). I've been with Alasdair (my boyfriend) for nearly 3 years, the past two he's joined the raf. We've been through basics which was extremely difficult, with my living in Scotland and him having to move to the bottom of England. But regardless of the distance we got stronger than ever. Basics was testing but seeing him so happy when graduating made all the tears and heartbreak worth it. Now to the harder part, he's due to be deployed in April and I'm absolutely dreading the thought of it. I'm trying to keep positive but with the days ticking by I'm starting to struggle thinking about those 6-9 months so far apart and being alone. So expect to be hearing lots of moans and crys for the next wee while!!
-6	negative	loneliness	I've kept things bottled up for a long time, and now it feels like if I told people I know then it would only cause more problems. I have friends, but don't feel i can talk to any of them about it all because they wouldn't understand..
-4	negative	loneliness	I've learned in my life that no matter how much women claim to love unconditionally, they are full of crap. I've tested a lot of women and every one of then loved my personality, my character, my charisma and said I knew how to turn them on like nobody's business. However, once I show them a picture of me, their whole thought process changes and I'm immediately demoted to garbage status. I refuse to ever send a fake pic of myself but I also wait to send my real one. I don't use anything to deceive or give any false impression that I'm some hot guy but I just be myself.
-4	negative	loneliness	I've lost all of my best friends. I don't make friends easily and when I find a best friend I marry him. Lol but my last best friend just left and I'm feeling so lonely. I've pretty much isolated myself at home. Doing online college. I feel scared to meet new people and have to let someone new in.
-2	negative	loneliness	I've lost some one I loved today sad times
-3	negative	loneliness	I've never been able to truly connect with other people. I'm constantly insulted for every aspect of who I am (looks, mannerisms, speech, etc. ) No one understands me. I know it's my fault really because I'm the only common denominator in all of my many years of social interaction in which I am ridiculed. 
-4	negative	loneliness	I've never been in a real relationship. I tend to isolate myself now, I think I've given up
-10	negative	loneliness	I've never been overly religious but lately I've found myself lying awake at night with questions for God. Of course I may never get answers, but that doesn't stop me from screaming at him. Where does a baby go of it dies before it was even born is the biggest question on my mind. The Catholics believe in purgatory and that you need to pray for a persons soul to go to heaven. Now I'm not catholic but I've taken that approach. Each day I pray that my beautiful Emily will go to heaven and that God will hold her just as I would have had I ever been given the chance. I pray that my dad who died four years ago gets to meet her and look after her for me. Writing this down sounds so silly, but I need to find comfort somewhere
-2	negative	loneliness	I've normally always found a way to cope. In August though I sank to a new low where I really struggled to cope. Now I'm getting close to that same feeling. I find it hard to relax around people and I'm not sure anymore how to fix things. I fear if it gets worse I'll do something stupid.
-9	negative	loneliness	I've noticed that the first few days after he leaves is always the hardest. No matter how hard I try to keep myself busy, I find myself constantly breaking down throughout the day. It's as if nothing and no one can make me stop; just him. He's been gone numerous times since we've been together.sed on my honest opinion. I guess it all comes down to how you handle these kinds of situations.
-3	negative	loneliness	I've really messed up now. My parents wanted my phone but I woulen
-6	negative	loneliness	I've really ruined my life now. I feel disgusting. Yesterday, hormones got the better of me, and I had this weird you know, but online. with a guy twice my age and was a stranger, and now feel like I am so awful and cannot stand myself, I cheated on love of my life, help me please, Cannot stop crying. 
-8	negative	loneliness	I wake up and hardly receive any texts on my phone. I go out, but feel I'm alone sometimes. The main reason is that when I go to the gym, I see the same faces and looks are all they give. I just want a hobby that I can do with friends, rather than getting attention and no response  Do I smile and see what they do? Or do I try and talk to them. I really want to make some friends at the gym, but there's never really an opportunity to do so and I'm sad that it never happens, even though I try so hard :'(
-1	negative	loneliness	i wanna go to college and start a new start life. ive been looking for schools/universities that offers free education/scholarships. is it impossible? 
-9	negative	loneliness	I want a friend. I'm going through a lot of changes in my identity right now in terms of gender and sexuality. It's going smoothly but I can tell it's still weird for my friends and family right now and would like someone that I can talk about it openly with, along with nerdy things and stupid jokes and sharing different cultural things. All of that is great. I really just want someone that knows me from the get go as who I really am and therefore isn't so shocked by all of the trasitions. That's all.
-5	negative	loneliness	I want love to be simple. I want to trust without thinking. I want to be generous with my parts; and this is how I want to be loved.
-10	negative	loneliness	I want new friends. Nothing is wrong with the friends I have now, it's just I want new friends. Someone who wants and takes the time to truly get to know me. Talk on a daily basis. Start off knowing nothing about each other, and learn more and more about each other. No lying to impress. Just all facts. And who knows where and how close we'll get. That's the fun part about new friends. You never know how much that person might mean to you. They could be your other half.
-3	negative	loneliness	I want people to like me But I dont
-2	negative	loneliness	I want someone to talk to bout my problems i have nobody 
-2	negative	loneliness	I want to be a girls "pal" or " buddy" I'm a nice guy looking for a nice girl, like just friends.
-1	negative	loneliness	I want to be loved and touched by either a guy or a girl Just someone.
-3	negative	loneliness	I want to be surrounded by friends that I can trust and talk to and know that someone is there for me.
-1	negative	loneliness	I want to be with someone, but I'm afraid of getting shut down
-1	negative	loneliness	I want to have a friend thats there for me. Someone to chat with
-5	negative	loneliness	I want to have kids. I am 17 and I really want kids. That is what I was born to do. But I recently found out I might have pcos and I am terrified. I am so scared that I may never get the chance to.
-2	negative	loneliness	I want to meet new interesting people who actually want to have fun and interesting conversations. I prefer girls but anybody feel free to msg if want to make a new friend.
-1	negative	loneliness	I want to talk to him. Ugh. It's been the worst two days ever. Seriously thinking bout going to revival at church tonight just to pass time. I'm so lonely without my baby. 
-17	negative	loneliness	I was 16 when I found out I was pregnant I concieved may 2012 my due date was feb 11 2013. The day I turned 37 weeks pregnant I woke up to feel no movements from my babygirl I went to the hospital and I was so scared my first baby at a very young age. My mom and boyfriend were right by my side when they told me my baby has no heartbeat. We were terrified nothing could ever match or describe that kind of heart break. They induced me at 7pm I was in labor for 24 to 25 hours 7:30pm the next night it was time to push. I held my babygirl who was born sleeping on jan 22 2013. She was so precois and little she was 5lbs 9oz 17 and a half in long. I love her with all my heart in four days she would be 9 months old and it breaks my heart to know that I can't hold her but she keeps me strong and living &lt;3 I love her more than anything rest in paradise babygirl&lt;3
-7	negative	loneliness	I was always bullied when I was in middle school.. I always got called ugly and made fun of for being in slower classes. The thing I didn't understand is that I'm just like them. I'm human. I may not be the prettiest but let me tell you I am the nicest
-12	negative	loneliness	I was a naturally fearful person. Though, out of all my phobias, I have two that I want to face. I have always been an acrophobic (person fearful of heights) and a bathophobic (person fearful of depths [water]). I seem to be the adventurous type, wanting to head down to somewhere myself has never been yet. The ocean and the sky are both majestic places. I am just so amazingly inspired by those who take risks and videotape the experiences, making me view how it is like. However, I want to fully experience them and lose these phobias! I want to have the adrenaline and experience these events with all senses!
-8	negative	loneliness	I was bestfriends with this girl amy! me and her were so so close, like I could tell her absolutely anything! then one day this girl called Melissa got really really jealous and started taking Amy away from me and saying mean stuff to her which I never said! but amy doesn't believe that I didn't say it! she believes Melissa. in school I'm the "third wheele" and I always get left out in everything. amy ignores me in English whenever we sit beside eachother. I'm just done with everything. I need help. I have no one x
-1	negative	loneliness	i was born to tell you i love you ))
-10	negative	loneliness	I was bullied physically and mentally when I was younger. School is supposed to be a safe place for kids to learn and grow with friends, and that's why I think my bullying was the hardest on my mother. She couldn't do anything about the fact that I came home crying everyday. As many calls and visits to the school as she made, nothing ever changed until I left. I'm better now, for the most part. It was a long time ago. That's why I hate bullying.
-5	negative	loneliness	I was "cheated" on 3 months ago and I left after getting concrete evidence and knowing that all my paranoia was true. What I did was leaving, telling him thanks for hurting me and wishing him the best. Everyone said I did the right thing but I feel like I'm suppressing all the unsaid words. It's killing me every night when it gets dark and I can't get to sleep. I need advice.
-7	negative	loneliness	I was having a really bad day, feeling especially worthless, unloved, not good enough and unwanted. I sat down and started planning my suicide. The most painful way to go, what to leave behind, the ago that'd be playing. A very twisted wedding, almost, a marriage to death. I was a paragraph in on my suicide note when I realized something. I wasn't proud of my last words. They were angry and sad and weak and I didn't want to leave that behind. It's funny how much that helped me realize I want to live.
-11	negative	loneliness	I was hoping I could get some advice from mothers who have lost a child. With Christmas approaching, I'm even more unsure of how to handle many things. Everything is a question in my mind but my question today is how other families have handled family ornaments for the Christmas tree. Every year we buy an ornament for the tree with each of our names written on it and the year. My son was 5 months old when he passed away in March of this year. Last Christmas was his first Christmas so he obviously was included on the ornament. Do I include him on the ornaments bought this year? Please let me know how your family may have handled this or any other similar situations. 
-8	negative	loneliness	I was in a marriage where my ex was a workaholic. The guy I dated afterwards was so needy and couldn't stand up to his ex wife. He is do possessive and is a control freak. I was not to socialize unless I wanted to guarantee the night ending in a fight. All my older friends are from my marriage or have moved away. I feel very alone because the guy I was seeing still tries to control everything using the situation I've been left in.
-1	negative	loneliness	I was in a really bad relationship for too long.
-7	negative	loneliness	I was in the worlds worst mood. There was a part of my doubting if I wanted to do this anymore. Then last night he got a 30 minute phone call. And it all reminded me of exactly why I'm here. And now I can't stop smiling. I love my soldier. So much. And these small moments make it all worth while. Soldier on MilSOs
-4	negative	loneliness	I was just think I need someone to talk to about all my stress and anxiety. And then I realized even if some wonderful person replies and wants to talk I can't make my fingers type the words I really need to get off my chest. The words I have waited years to say out loud. So what's the point In asking someone to talk if I have nothing to say. On the other side of things I'm a great listener lol 
-6	negative	loneliness	I was left home alone for like 3 hours this morning and I decided why not try decorate a little. So I did. I liked it. It was nice. And pretty. Anyways. My parents come home and go ew take it down. It doesn't match. It looks ugly. Like what the heck. Okay. I don't need this I went to my room and I'm still giving my mom a little attitude. Seriously? I should've never tried to help.
-1	negative	loneliness	I wasn't always like this. I've learned to like me. Weirdness, randomness, and everything.
-8	negative	loneliness	I wasn't due til October. But last night my Fiance and I came to the ER because our baby wasn't moving. They messed around wi th the dopplers and big machines, but no heartbeat could be found. So then came the ultrasound, again nothing. They broke the news to us as best they could. I could do nothing but cry. They are inducing me today to deliver the baby. I feel like this is all my fault, that I somehow caused our baby to go. I've never been through this, I feel so empty, broken, angery, depressed. I've even told my Fiance that I felt like I didn't even want to live anymore. I feel so helpless and worthless. I will never hear this baby cry, never get to watch it grow. It was our 3rd child. I don't even know how or what to think right now. I'm so numb! 
-2	negative	loneliness	I was prescribed Xanax when I was 15 years old and from that moment on my full on addiction had begun. Stealing, lying, cheating, fighting. I've been through it all. From suicide attempts to probation. I am now happy to say I have an entire year clean from this drug. Message me if you need help or someone to talk to
-3	negative	loneliness	I was recently diagnosed with asthma a few days ago after a terrifying experience in the ER. My boyfriend doesn't really seem to care or understand what I'm going through. I'm new to this to but it would be nice if HE would take measures as to understand what is going on with my body and what precautionary measures I'm going to have to start taking. Instead I'm on my own and I feel heart broken.
-1	negative	loneliness	I was robbed Dec 27th and can't get over this anxiousness. I need help plz
-4	negative	loneliness	I was talking to a person on this site who I thought understood me. But the person deleted there profile because of the "anxiety" now I have no one to talk to who remotely understands me. I feel so abandoned. And I didn't even know the person. It just nice to talk to somebody. This is why I say good things never last.
-3	negative	loneliness	I was waiting for this dude for 6months and I told him I couldn't wait anymore  . But I found myself thinking about him crying because I really want him back but I don't know how to get him back !!!!!!
-7	negative	loneliness	I was with a girl for just over 2 years, and she took every friend I ever had away.  Now she's gone, and im struggling to deal with constantly being lonely, i have a couple of friends, but its literally only two, and they both have they're own issues to deal with
-8	negative	loneliness	I was young and pregnant. 16 to be exact and I got pregnant with twin girls. It was a difficult pregnancy with many problems .I was in the hospital a lot. Then on Christmas eve I went to the hospital for premature labor. I can honestly say they did every thing possible to try and stop my labor.well on Christmas night I gave birth to amanda danielle and amiela dawn. Amiela lived 30 minutes and Amanda 12 hours.I left the hospital 2 days later with empty hands.I buried my daughters that same day.I still miss them to this day 
-2	negative	loneliness	I watched the months before. Why did it have to happen to us?
-3	negative	loneliness	I went so far off the rails I couldn't see the track. I'm cutting my own path now and even though it's scary a new start is what i needed.
-15	negative	loneliness	I went to stay at a newly-renovated hotel in Jacksonville Beach, FL with a few friends for a 'girl's nite out', and as I was sitting in a chair in the room, a penny literally dropped onto the floor from the middle/bottom of my chair.  All of us were freaked out as to where it could have come fromor howor why.  And an hour later, while walking on the beach, I found a penny in a pile of seashells that had coral deposits growing on it.   And then another random penny.etc  To this day, when we all meet (2 x a yr.), we always wonder, 'what was up with the crazy pennies'.   (Sometimes when we get together we go 'ghost hunting'.  We think that the souls in the old hotel knew we were 'tuned in'.)   We were.   
-4	negative	loneliness	I went to the cinema alone today. No one else was there by themselves I felt so lonely  Does anyone else go to the cinema alone?
-3	negative	loneliness	i will ace my job interview tomorrow. i will find new friends. i will keep busy. and i will find the strength to be alone and not feel lonely. i will brush off all the harsh things he says to me and i will find the courage to leave. i will i have to because i am terribly lonely with him and i cant take it anymore.  i love him dearly and i cry thinking about leaving him but i feel so unwanted and unloved and i just am so depressed and hopeless and i cant deal
-5	negative	loneliness	I will expand on this later but my old friend passed away while I was in the room. 2nd the nursing home where he was has either stolen or discarded certain items in less than week after the death. Make this a rule NEVER GO INTO A HOME, ask to be put down or commit suicide. 
-1	negative	loneliness	I will have a test of history of 19 century so wish me luck !!!
-1	negative	loneliness	I will never get to kiss the scrape on your knee and slowly dry your tears. You will always be my daughter. My girl. And I will always be your mom. I wish I could trade places with you. 
-16	negative	loneliness	I will try to be as honest as I can, because I don't want to be misunderstood. Life is a wonderful thing, and so is love. There is so much about life that I appreciate and love. And it is in that sense which I am lonely. It is not simply the loneliness of having no one to come home to, to be there when I so often fall apart. What I long for is someone who sees me not for merely what I am; this pathetic person that I am; but sees in me as the pilgrim of a certain world. What I long for is a companion who can stand beside me, yet stand apart. Someone who knows love, in the fullest sense of the word. I know that is why I am lonely, because anyone can sleep there beside you, but only a rare and beautiful person can see the despairing pilgrim within you.  So in a way, I rejoice in my loneliness. But it is still a gut wrenching feeling to know that everything you hold true to yourself can be screaming at the top of its voice, but no one is there to hear. 
-4	negative	loneliness	I wish I could just talk to someone and say something that I want to say. I'm depressed, and don't know why I just hide it off with a smile. I just feel like I'm a burden to everyone because I'm so weird. I feel ugly, and I know I am, and just feel like uggghh. I used to get bullied all throughout last year because of how I looked now it's not too bad I get comments about me here and there, but it does hurt it repeats in my head all day long sometimes for the whole week.
-4	negative	loneliness	I wish I could talk to someone who cares genuinely, like i know that I care about others. When I am alone, I am depressed and cry a lot when no one knows. I have to be brave everyday and face the world, knowing that I don't want to be here. I feel like I'm unwanted and I'm still living because of God. I'm so lost in this distant life, and every single day is a drag.
-1	negative	loneliness	I wish I had a boyfriend. I want someone who is kind and likes to cuddle. It's sad i just feel alone and need someone.
-5	negative	loneliness	I wish I was the type of person who could hold good conversations, but I think I have social anxiety or something I just honestly don't like half the people I'm surrounded with at school. I'm not a person who has a bunch of friends, although I do have a best friend, and Id like to make more!
-5	negative	loneliness	I wish that I knew the date of when my life will get better. Then I could count and cross off the days on my calendar. But for now its a mystery. Really, I don't even know if things will get better. My birthday is coming soon and I know I will spend it alone. And Christmas will find me all by myself. This is just not easy for me.
-13	negative	loneliness	I woke up in a dark place, it's pitch black and i can't see anything around me. Here i stand alone in this darkness. Thoughts run through my mind all at once like an electric shock. I cant bear the pain, the  weight on my head, it's killing me. I'm crying  out your name and no answer. How I'm going to carry this burden alone. I can't bear it on my own. PLEASE!!! I'm begging you, I'm on my knees begging you to help me bear this weight. The pain of these thoughts shot across my head again. I cant bear it, its pushes me further into the earth. "HELP!!! PLEASE!! JUST ANSWER ME '. I'm burning up, im dying. I got up i tried walking, now i'm confuse, i see no roads leading anywhere. I'm going in circles. I fell, now im at rock bottom, i kneel and once again i cried your name aloud, "WHERE ARE YOU?"
-7	negative	loneliness	I woke up this morning feeling so sad. Another morning without you, weekend starts alone and our 1yr anniversary is tmrw. Getting dressed for work and this song comes on and stops me in my tracks. Sat there and started to cry because it's perfect. It describes everything I'm feeling, describes my baby and what all this means.  I hate this. I hate the lonely nights. I hate not knowing, not being able to touch or kiss them but I love who I love. I can't stop even if I tried. So this is my fate. I'll wait as long as I have to till we're together again. &lt;3
-4	negative	loneliness	I wondered if I would ever be writing my experience in here. I will be removing this story in the due time - which I hope will be within a few weeks at least. 
-3	negative	loneliness	I wonder if emotions are like web strands we can connect to the world through.
-2	negative	loneliness	I wonder, if I say ''Hi'' to everyone on 
-3	negative	loneliness	I wonder why it's so hard to find an honest, kind and trustworthy woman. I'm an honest, kind and caring guy and I just want someone to spend quality time with.
-19	negative	loneliness	i wont expect anybody to respond to this..or reach out, i just hope somebody hears this, i know things will never be the same. we both hurt eachother badly, at one point we were at eachothers throats, dont matter we could sit down and throw weapons at eachother i said this you said that it'll never end,but at the end of the day i understand, i was protecting my family as the same you were.we've moved past that and now im by your side, i guess its true when they say time heals, even if it takes years. im afraid things will heatup again all it takes is that one word like last time..id hate for us to go down that path again.i couldnt take it i dont what i would do, i didnt think id come back after last time but i did, now im scared it'll happen again cus history has a way of always repeats itself
-2	negative	loneliness	I won't give up on us I love you D. Stefani! I'm so lucky to be your girl  You are the man of my dreams, and you will always be worth the wait.
-11	negative	loneliness	I wont lie, I am having the hardest time being away from my marine.  THEN, My marine started asking me the other dayif I would ever get married and move to Cali with him. Of course I was straight freaking out, breathing got heavy, mind got foggy, butterflies going crazy, and smiling like a maniac. I know he was probably just feeling things out so I wont jump the gun but I also have never had a bf that thinks about getting married more than I do. He justmakes me feel special. 
-4	negative	loneliness	I would like to relate to someone at least I have a terrible time feeling comfortable around people. I guess all i need is to feel that i'm not the only one dealing with social anxiety. 
-11	negative	loneliness	I would like to talk to.. Anybody! At the moment i'm in a situation where i'm pretty lonely. I have a girlfriend so dont get the wrong idea. I would just like to talk to somebody, especially somebody who has a problem and has nobody to talk to. I like to help people in my free time but i dont always know how. I've been in some nasty situations and never really had someone to talk to. So if i could be that person for anyone else, please let me be that person for you. I won't judge. Kromestar
-1	negative	loneliness	I would like to talk to teenagers. That's all 
-2	negative	loneliness	I would love someone to talk to. Maybe around 17-25? I love having debates, or just talking about everything and nothing at all.
-1	negative	loneliness	I would love  to have a fun company right now 
-1	negative	loneliness	I would love to talk to someone (-:
-4	negative	loneliness	I wouldn't say I'm lonely because I guess I could have company if I wanted. I just choose to be alone because there's no one particularly I want to be around.
-2	negative	loneliness	I write poems when I'm lonely. One being  I really liked this one c:
-4	negative	loneliness	Just been on my mind, I've been trinna let it go, trinna find something so incredible as you & I. & it's impossible nothing can compare to you. Feeling the vapors, I'm asking can I hit it agian?
-2	negative	loneliness	Just floating around in the abyss of boredom. I'm a lost soul with the memorials of a thousand things I may have done wrong..looking for conversation, a friend or a debate on anything from religion to college football.  
-1	negative	loneliness	Just got a 20 minute conversation with my SO who is at basic!
-10	negative	loneliness	Just got off of Skype with my amazing soldier. &lt;3 He always finds a way to put a smile on my face no matter what! His sergeant (who calls me kitkat lol) is requesting that I send them a ton of kitkats for valentines day. haha I lovee how supportive & helpful his unit has been to not only me but to Brandon. They help him out SO much with everything its ridiculous. The bond between a soldier and their unit is incredible. I can't wait till they all come home in December and I get to personally meet every one of them finally  
-3	negative	loneliness	Just heard from my soldier for the first time in a few days. It's the little things that mean the world to me! Gosh I miss you! Keep smiling and stay strong! I'll be here when you come home. 
-2	negative	loneliness	just one person to talk to that would understand, there has to be at least one person out there somewhere 
-4	negative	loneliness	Just received a text message from my Airman! That my friends, is what makes it all worth it. I love him so much, and I am so proud to be an Air Force girlfriend.
-14	negative	loneliness	Just recently, I fell in love with my best friend. We're together, but the only thing that is truly holding us back right now is the fact that he will be going to boot camp on January 7, 2014. He didn't say exactly how long he'd be there, but it would be a little over nine months. I know that the moment I'm waiting for him in the airport the day he comes home and seeing him for the first time in months, it's going to be the happiest moment of my life. Compared to other military girlfriends, nine months doesn't compare to years for others, and I'm truly grateful that it's just bootcamp. Absence makes the heart grow fonder, and I'll try my best to wake up with a smile on my face every day knowing that he'll be thinking about me.
-1	negative	loneliness	Just someone to talk to about life. 
-2	negative	loneliness	Just someone who will get what mean an ???
-1	negative	loneliness	Just spent the entire day getting ready for nothing. I don't even know if it's normal to never go out on dates, or if it's just my boyfriend who doesn't care enough to treat me to a good time. Am I overreacting to be upset?
-3	negative	loneliness	Just want some cute dude to u with messages add me to your circles show me love
-5	negative	loneliness	Just when I think I'm getting over this break up. It seems like one memory makes me sad again. Sometimes I wish I never loved her so much. Or met her.
-2	negative	loneliness	Just when I think I'm ready to forget him, he invades my dreams and opens the wounds again.
-2	negative	loneliness	Kenny leaves for boot camp in June. Ahhh that is only 5 months away. I'm freaking out!
-3	negative	loneliness	Kids, now what comes to mind when you think of kids, not goats. I'm sick of sitting having a coffee, while kids are climbing over everything, including the counters and tables.

-5	negative	loneliness	Last September 2013, I was diagnosed with an overactive thyroid or hyperthyroidism and my Doc put me on 20mg Carbimazole and after 3 months of taking it, my hyperthyroidism reverse to hypothyroidism. So i turned out hypo. I was just confused of my symptoms because even if I am now hypo, I still have some hyperthyroidism symptoms. Why? I am so depressed! Help me please! 
-4	negative	loneliness	Last summer when my best friend and I watching movies we kissed and touched but then I told him to left my house I feels guilty

-5	negative	loneliness	Last year I meet my big brother from another mother for the first time in my life and he falls in love with me ! And Pushed me to make love with him .
-14	negative	loneliness	Last year on July 9, 2012, my first born son, Tyler Jay Hartley, was born premature. He lived for about two hours and died in hands. My life changed after that. The doctor said I had to have been under a lot of stress to have had this happen. And I was. When I was pregnant, I was staying with my mom and three sisters. My siblings didn't like that their older sister was pregnant and was staying with them. So they did everything in their power to drive me insane and make me cry and to make me want to kill myself. The only reason why I didn't commit suicide.was because I knew that my little boy was inside me and that soon everything would be ok. But that day when I lost him everything inside me changed. I didn't want to live no more. My sisters couldn't even look me in the face.they blamed themselves for what happened. I blame myself I never got to see his eyes and that's what killed me the mostblueberry
-4	negative	loneliness	Lately it just feels like I have no one to talk to. My friends and family are usually supportive but, it feels like they're getting sick of my constant mopeyness. I need someone who want judge me
-1	negative	loneliness	lately ive been feeling very lonely like nobody likes me or can like my and I just really need a hug right now but I wont get one 
-3	negative	loneliness	Lately I've been really annoyed with myself and everyone around me. I'm not sure why. Perhaps I'm in need of a change. School is coming up and i'm not so happy about that. Nothing okay anymore and i just need some new friends.
-7	negative	loneliness	Lately, I've been struggling with feelings of isolation.  It's not so much I am isolated, but that the number of people I can relate to has dwindled far too low.  I also don't know who has changed: me or them.  What I do know is that people I used to find companionship in just plain annoy me now. Isolation is scary, and I can only bide my time until I find the courage to make changes for the better in my life.
-1	negative	loneliness	Let's just say life is running me hard now I just wish someone would show me a little love and affection for the things I give to the world.
-16	negative	loneliness	Lets start at the beginning, my grandad had cancer so my family moved back with him to support him, he lived for two years. In that time I reunited with old friends and made a new relationship that lasted for almost a year. When he died we had planned on moving but it wasn't for another year that we moved, in this year everything I had crumbled. My friends started falling away and my relationship flew out of the window. Yet this girl still stayed close to me and some friends still talked with me. I moved some months ago and I have no friends, I still have feelings for this girl and I don't want to tell her because I don't know if she's with some, my old friends don't want to talk to me and if they do, I think they just are trying to be nice. I'm not being the OMG I'm all depressed and all that its, I just want to talk to people, meet someome new. Start with a fresh plate.,
-3	negative	loneliness	Letter to my lost love I dream of us sometimes..lying side by side, you gently touching my face, and I wake up crying for what once was..
-3	negative	loneliness	Life has knocked me down a few times , it showed me things i never wanted to see . I experienced sadness and failures  . but one thing for sure .I ALWAYS GET UUUP . 
-4	negative	loneliness	Life is weird. If I had a bunch of money to give, people would come in droves. Well, I have a lot of love to give and nobody wants it. Wish so badly to be loving and kind to a special someone.
-1	negative	loneliness	Life > Koyaanisqatsi  I am part Sioux and this word is Hopi but it has come to mean so much to me. I do not live in such a way that I might live a Koyaanisqatsi life. The old way intrigues and inspires me. And I want to share with people the beauty of the old way.
-2	negative	loneliness	Like, people probably have more serious problems. But it's just school and people, like jerks that bother me. But I act like I'm okay.
-1	negative	loneliness	Like really?? What if that was you? Think of how it feels
-9	negative	loneliness	Like the title says I'm a very lonely person(first time I've admitted it), I had lots of friends right up until high school ended and everyone either grew apart or moved away, now there's just me and recently I tried to remedy the situation by telling a friend I've always had my heart set on being with her.and now I think I've lost one moreI just don't know what to do anymore, but I consider this a step in some direction, so if anyone wants to tlk ill be here
-3	negative	loneliness	Like thinking and reflecting on life, meditation clears the mind it takes like 10 min. It depends on the person, a clear mind is nice for a new day.
-7	negative	loneliness	Loneliness is a true burden. Once it breaches the confines of your mind it will spread and further consume and envelop everything. The pain which soon follows spreads like wildfire and pierces your insides worse than any blade ever could. I am tired of constantly experiencing such loneliness everyday. It seems that one way or another I am constantly being reminded of it in some way, shape or form. Even though I seem to have those in my life who supposedly care for me. I cannot seem to feel it nor does it seem to have any effect. (i guess I'm just selfish?) It is nothing like the feeling of romantic love, that warmth and joy of someone who is there for you and by your side. Who you can always open up and talk to when things get rough. Someone who cares for your well bring and desires you at the same time. I feel as though for someone like me, I should just give up on ever experiencing something or having someone like that. 
-3	negative	loneliness	Loneliness is when you have more than 300 contacts saved in your phone but there is not a single number you can dial when you feel broken ..
-7	negative	loneliness	Loneliness. No one truly understand what loneliness is. They say you choose to be that way,..go out and do things. It's not that easy for an introvert like me. Never had a boyfriend before, never  done anything. I'm a strong Christian woman. I hope to find a strong Christian man
-3	negative	loneliness	Lonely has such a bad connotation. I enjoy being alone. I don't know it's just me I guess. I've found comfort in it.
-4	negative	loneliness	Lonely is a feeling you never get used to. I'm 25 and I've always been lonely as far back as I can remember. All the way back to elementary school. I just got sick of trying to fight it. When I think about it my eyes water and it sends chills down my arms to my fingers. My heart hurts. And the saddest part, is that I have a lot of love to give. If Someone would only stop to let me give it to them. Tired of fake smiling.
-4	negative	loneliness	"Loner: A person who prefers not to associate with others" I am like this a lot so yes I guess I am.
-2	negative	loneliness	Looking  I'm lonely here at work and I'm looking for a woman who'd like to chat here ..

-4	negative	loneliness	Maybe I am going crazy :/ I miss him so much But may God be with him in marine bootcamp. JT I freaking love you baby! i will wait for your letter even one after 7 weeks of waiting and more . I will be grateful to God that you are okay. I love you so much, I hope you dont forget about me and never forget that I will be here for you when you get back. I love you baby . Just give me a sign that You are okay baby.
-1	negative	loneliness	Maybe i don't cry but it hurts  maybe i won't show but I care
-2	negative	loneliness	Maybe if it wasn't for a few people I would not be going through this everyday
-4	negative	loneliness	Maybe lonely is not the right word choice here, I AM ALONE.  The thing is I really don't mind it. Being alone helps me think. I am  more susceptible to do a lot of crazy things and give in to peer pressure when I'm with friends. Being alone helps me stay true to  and discover a lot about myself. And I like it.
-3	negative	loneliness	May God give me the strength to have patience and courage that within this 7 weeks of passing has gone by and I havent received a letter due to the circumstances of phase 2.  I love you , my hero who is becoming my MARINE someday 
-10	negative	loneliness	Me and. Girl I was in a deep relationship with broke up. We met up last night for dinner. She enjoyed herself I did too. Lol I really had fun. But Idk I don't wanna take too much from it. Tho she told me she's not saying yes or no to us getting back together. Idk I guess I'm kinda wondering lol eh
-2	negative	loneliness	Me and my baby went and got our marriage license yesterday ! It's almost official I'm gonna  be mrs. Johnson 
-11	negative	loneliness	Me and my husband were together for 9 years before getting married . When he decided to join the military after AIT I decided to follow him and marry him at his new location . Every since we've became married things have changed . He's constantly going out with friends , staying out all night . I'm pregnant which makes matters worse . Idk if I've becoming a big ball of emotional but one things for sure I've never felt more along in my whole entire life . It's almost like he hates being around me now .
-12	negative	loneliness	me and this girl were so so close.. we both were depressed and we would of always helped each other! but one day I came home from school, and she stopped talking to me, she was my best friend.. she decided to move on and she said to me 'I push people away, it's what I do, I can't be friends with the same person for a long time' then she started picking out all my flaws and everything that is wrong with me.. then she started saying that I never helped her or saved her life, and she just said I did so I wouldn't die because everyone would blame her for not stopping me, so yeah I'm seriously beyond depressed.. but I self harmed since March last year, and two nights ago I flushed my blades, I don't want to cut anymore, I'll just ignore everything for a while, although It feels like I have no one to talk to anymore.
-12	negative	loneliness	Met my boyfriend about a month before he was to be deployed and immediately fell in love with his querky additude and sarcasm and his genuine kindness. He has been gone only about a month and it already feels like its straining on our relationship. Today we were talking and i told him i had to do something real quick just so i could cry. He's been cheated on before while away by his ex and I know it worries him and it bothers me when he thinks of me that way. We are trying to make the best of it though and thats all you can really do. I know I love him and when he comes home (in a year) we plan on living a long happy life together 
-2	negative	loneliness	Missing my man so much tonight. It's been 2 weeks without him. Hope to hear from him soon. I've been going thru a lot and it's difficult having to deal with everything on my own.. I wish I could just hear his voice just once. Or see him. Blah
-2	negative	loneliness	Miss my ex bf even though i know he loves his ex before me not me

-2	negative	loneliness	most of girls say they want a good guy but when they meet him they keep him in the friend zone chase after jerks and end up heartbroken 
-2	negative	loneliness	My 2 bestest friends left me in 7th and 8th grade to finish High School alone. But we always keep in touch but its not the same anymore as it use to be.
-8	negative	loneliness	My 2 yrs fiance cheated on me on our 8 months together and I found out and was so mad and he just gave up and let me go and he told me he needs space !!! I wonder if he really loves me or not
-8	negative	loneliness	My 43 year old son and I had been estranged for a while. The last time I saw him was 2011. He actually blamed me for all the bad things in his life as he had been in prison a few times and he made up fantastice lies to make people feel sorry for him. He passed away Saturday, 12-21, and no one contacted me until a week later on Sunday, 12-29. Now, I can't even get his wife to contact me and he has/had an 11 year old son that I would like to see about. I don't even know where he is. I'm so at a loss as to how to feel. One minute I'm angry the next I'm sad. I'm angry that he lied about me but I'm sad he probably died hating me. I just don't know what to feel and my older son doesn't even accept him as his brother so I have no support system there. My husband, not his father, seems to think I should be moving on already. Does no one understand how I feel. 
-16	negative	loneliness	My 89 year old father passed away on the 6th of September..I can not think of him without tears forming in my eyes.. I loved him so much, he was a wonderful husband to my mother and father to my brothers and I. I feel blessed that we had him with us this long. Anyway, my mother use to tell us the story that she used to work in a drive in restaurant in the 40's as a "carhop" My dad who was in the Navy stopped by and left her a penny tip. He later would tell us that was all he had. I talked to my mother this evening, she is very distraught with missing him. She said that he has come by to see her. He has turned the light on next to her chair when she comes in the house after being away. Today, she found a penny in her bed..Truly, a penny from Heaven for my mother, from the man she loved for 67 years. thank you God for your blessings and for my father's unending love.
-4	negative	loneliness	My account randomly shut down and I had to make a new EP. Weird right? Lol anyway my boyfriend is named Kenny. He has yet to decide when he will join the Marine Corps. My reason for making this account was to have support from others for when Kenny does leave and I'm left to finish my high school career without him physically here. Any tips on how to not feel so lonely?
-3	negative	loneliness	My baby is unhappy I hurt and yearn for her. I can't sleep it's so bad she's my life she gets me motivated and she makes me happy. My brother took her from me. I hate him I hope she grows up normal.
-1	negative	loneliness	My bedroom is my only home.
-21	negative	loneliness	My best friend finally moved in w/me and we were a good couple I thought; He left for 2months and had a terrible car accident. When he was well enuf to travel he came back to me. I nursed him back to health. I loved him. I saw he was a lil stir crazy from being in the house so I signed him up for classes and physical therapy. Tye more he went out and the mre people he met, the less he seemed to like me & the more he drank. I came to a head and he came at me like he was going to hit me, I ended it and put him out. We tried to work it out but we couldn't, Now we are still friends, the relationship is over, we still love each other but don't wont to be hurt again, So we are both moving on, looking for some one new. Slowly leaving the other behind, unable to be honest and tell each other the truth. We should've moved on a long time ago.
-2	negative	loneliness	My best friend helped me get hired at the place she worked at which was amazing of her. And I've been there for almost a year now , anyways lately she's been very controlling , and down right rude example when it's just her and I in the workplace alone she's all good but around upper management she criticizes everything I do infront of them to make herself look better, maybe in just having a hard time taking orders from a friend , especially everyday we used to hang out outside of work all the time now we don't at all, not to mention she always has to one up me !
-10	negative	loneliness	My best friend, my mom, died of colon cancer 14 years ago. I have a brother, but he lives in AR with his wife and new baby. My father moved back to Louisiana shortly after my mother died and married a woman who he went to school with. My half-sister lives here has her family to deal with and we rarely talk. My best friend died this past summer and I have not gotten over that at all. My husband is in law enforcement and has crazy shift hours and I am alone with my 11 yr old son most of the time.
-7	negative	loneliness	My best friend says he cares about me. But I can see in his eyes that he doesn't. He says that he only wants to help me and get me to be brave. But he doesn't even pay attention to me. All he cares about is video games and telling me and his close friends what to do. I'm not even sure what to do anymore. The sad thing isI'm not even sure if I care about anything or anyone anymore. I have a tendency to lie a lot as well. I've lied to lot of people. And I can't stop. It just comes naturally. Something's wrong with me, and I can't get a hold of what it is.
-2	negative	loneliness	My best friend seems to make excuses to hang out with me now days. Mine of my other friends want to hang out either. I always just seem to be by myself allot
-12	negative	loneliness	My BF and I have been living together for a couple years but we do not love each other and are both fully aware we are only together for financial reasons. He stays downstairs and I upstairs.. This is our life. I know he needs me for financial reasons and he is aware I need him just simply because I have no one else. How do you dump someone when you have NO one else (no exaggeration). I got married at a young age (1 and due to our age and his anger problems I left 2 years later. I always think about that love we did have though.. I miss it.  I miss having someone there. I hate being alone and can't stand being in a secluded bubble. There are people all around me that smile and laugh I remember doing that once upon a time. 
-8	negative	loneliness	My bf broke up with me because he believed if we stayed together it'd be harder for him to go off and pursue his career I now know this and found it was hard for him. Everyone tells him I was the right one.. Will he be back?
-3	negative	loneliness	My bf is leaving for Marine Boot camp soon. I'm happy for him because he has always want this. Our relationship has been through a lot. Everyone around us is always convincing us to break it off (we're been going strong for  1.5 years now) because  
-26	negative	loneliness	My bf JT left for the marine bootcamp on December 2,2013. He left with no goodbye just like that he was gone . I know its going to be at least 3 months maximum that I wont be seeing him which is hard. So now I'm waiting for a letter from him checking the mail, and hoping I get something. Qnd I know the marine bootcamp is one of the hardcore stuff but its been 7 weeks I havent gotten anything between this week and the other weeks . I assume he is busy and sunday is I guess the only day he can write and stuff. I'm just scared that he forgot about me , and knowing that he was leaving for bootcamp I said yes to him being my boyfriend. Everyday I check the mail, knowing and hoping my marine will write to me at least giving me a headsup that he is okay. I love him to death and he knows I do, but honestly should I be worried? He didnt tell me any address or sorts so that I can write to him. Should I be worried ? Or I am going crazy since its 7 weeks and getting nothing in the mail from JT ?
-8	negative	loneliness	My boyfriend and I were talking for 6-7 months while he was on deployment in japan. We started dating a little over a month ago. He recently just left to go back to where he is stationed he believed he was going to be back home June/July he called me yesterday and told me he doesn't get to come home until December. I got so used to him being home and it was upsetting to see him leave! I'm new to the military girlfriend thing and I really don't have anyone to get military girlfriend advice from! I saw this website with the posts and thought id join and post and connect with other military girlfriends!
-7	negative	loneliness	My boyfriend called me this morning at 5 am, I talked to him for about 4 minutes. The first time I've talked to him since he left 2 weeks ago. It's crazy how just the sound of someone's voice can remind you of how in love you are with them. Needless to say I've had a great day.
-8	negative	loneliness	My boyfriend deployed today for 3 1/2 months. I understand this isn't much time to many of you who have dealt with longer but I really need support because seeing him go tore me apart. It's our first time away from each other and I don't know what to expect. We are great together and we both know that we can last through this yet I'm confused on how this goes. 
-20	negative	loneliness	My boyfriend did the impossible to come to CA from FL to meet me. We fell in love, you can say "virtually" we dated other ppl, we didn't quite know each other, but we always ended up talking and having chemistry. We did this for about 3 yrs. the beginning of February he called me and said if I wanted to see him he would be here for valentines day, I said yes. And quite surely he came. We clicked instantly we were inseparable. But now as the days go by, he's not the same anymore. He cheated. I forgave him. We're still together and he's cold with me. He thinks one day a week is fine for each other. He wants his space. I tell him how I feel and it aggravates him, he says he doesn't care about my baby feelings. When I do see him everything is oh so beautiful. He always threatens to break up with me. And I'm just getting so tired of it  idk what to do, I love him
-3	negative	loneliness	My boyfriend goes to boot camp in 17 days and I'm already crying how am I going to make it threw 6 months
-4	negative	loneliness	My boyfriend got deployed today, it was hard to take at first.. I cried a little. He's going to be gone for 6 months and I miss him already. I keep telling myself what he always tells me: "It's ok to be sad but don't cry about it, embrace it and try and make the best of it. It's not the end of the world, I'll come back"
-6	negative	loneliness	My boyfriend has been gone for AIT for about two months now. I've been able to keep relatively strong, until today. The minute I woke up this morning the distance hit me hard. After forcing myself out of the bed and to get ready for the day he text me which I immediately started to cry. I managed to get to school and make it through a couple of classes before i couldn't do it anymore, I had to go home. I just wanted to curl up in my bed and just lay there. I miss him so much, and just want him home. Does it get easier further down the road? Will there always be days like this?
-11	negative	loneliness	My boyfriend has been in San Diego for almost a month now and I can't tell you how excited I am to get to see him graduate. The letters are what keeps me going these days. And when it comes to graduation, I've been looking up dress code ALOT. I know the proper attire from the USMC site and everyone here says go comfy. Personally I'm a converse kind of girl anyway, so shoes isn't my problem, the rest of the outfit is. I'm stuck between a dress or just a normal outfit. (Jeans, a nice shirt, etc.) help! I don't know if I should maybe get a cute dress and just save it for the graduation day? 
-2	negative	loneliness	My boyfriend has officially left for boot camp, do you guys have ANY advice, I'm clueless!
-9	negative	loneliness	My boyfriend is a Navy Sailor and I miss him horribly. We have only been dating since November but I have known him for 5 years. His ship is stationed in Japan and it was recently deployed. He messaged me a few days ago telling me his ship will be back at his port in Japan on the 21st. I am so excited to finally be able to talk to him again but it was so hard having him away from me. I just want to be with him so much and it is even worse knowing he has never gotten leave. I also found out he won't be able to make it t my Senior prom. None of that matters though as long as he returns safely home.
-4	negative	loneliness	My boyfriend is a poolee who will be shipping out for basic on July 14. We've been together for over a year and I really think we can stay together. It'll be really really hard, no doubt, but we love each other and both are determined to not give up even when things get tough. Even now, I'm trying to get involved in more activities and hobbies so I'll be ready when he does leave and my schedule wont feel so emptyz Do you ladies have anything that you like doing when you're significant other is away?
-5	negative	loneliness	My boyfriend is being deployed for four months and then being  sent to another state when he returns. A deployment is already devastating enough, but now we will also be moving away and starting over right after. Neither of us are good at talking about our feelings, but I feel like the flood gates have opened and I have so many questions and concerns I want to discuss with him. I'm afraid to show him how sad and helpless I feel right now.
-3	negative	loneliness	My boyfriend is going to be deployed soon, I'm scared that I'm going to crumple to pieces without my only friend, my only real support I have.
-3	negative	loneliness	My boyfriend is going to be gone for 6 months. He's a Loadmaster in the Airforce. It breaks my heart that he will be away so long. But I do get to see him in between training during breaks. So wish me luck, I must stay strong 
-3	negative	loneliness	My boyfriend is in Spain for an internship. It's for 3 months. It just started. I broke out in tears tonight. I just don't know what to do with myself. My heart just hurts. This is my weak moment. I wouldn't ever share this on Facebook or with friends. Just strangers. I hate showing my sad sack side and my feelings. I guess people to talk to would be nice as well.
-10	negative	loneliness	My boyfriend is leaving for basic for 3 months tomorrow morning. We said our see you later and I love you's tonight before we took him to the hotel . I've never dealt with this before, I'm pretty sad to be apart for that long . Does anyone know how often they can make phone calls while he is in basic?
-4	negative	loneliness	my boyfriend is now gone for boot camp to become a marine . I miss him sooo bad but im being strong . he just got very sick down there so they had to remove him for a time to get medical treatment and im just so torn apart . I cant even talk to him and ask if hes ok im just so down about this . and I still haven't received a letter 
-1	negative	loneliness	My boyfriend just left for bootcamp in Paris island over the weekend, he's gone for three months and I'm such a mess.. I love him more than the world. He is the best thing to ever happen to me and I miss him tons and it's only the beginning .. 
-1	negative	loneliness	My boyfriend just left today for basic training for the Army and I'm so sad .  Any good advice ?
-3	negative	loneliness	My boyfriend keeps telling me he wants to get married and start a family. He's really giving me baby fever ! I miss him so much 
-2	negative	loneliness	My boyfriend left for bootcamp two days ago and im so lost without him  We have been dating for 2 1/2 years and not being able to talk and see him every day is making me absolutely miserable.. April cannot come soon enough. I just want to see his face and hear his voice again 
-5	negative	loneliness	My boyfriend lost someone very close to him a few months ago to suicide (we think). I have no idea what to say or how to help. He keeps everything bottled inside so I never really know what's wrong. I get impatient sometimes and try to push him to get over it for my own selfish purposes. I miss us being happy all the time. He's not depressed all the time but it's the majority of time. What can I say/do to maybe help him feel better? Other than sit by and be his shoulder to cry on, I have no idea what to do. It's very frustrating at times and the death of his friend has kind of put a wedge between us.
-14	negative	loneliness	My boyfriends dad called and said that Tyler wrote a letter to him and he read it to me. He's still in reception and he doesn't have my address cause it's his phone but sounds like he is doing alright. He says a lot of guys there are already homesick but he isn't yet. He also said slot of guys are getting yelled at by the drill sergeants, but he's stayed clear of it. It said to tell me he missed and loved me and just hearing that makes it okay. 
-6	negative	loneliness	My boyfriend sent me this, so we're gonna try and test it out. I thought it'd also be helpful for some of you out there It's kinda long lol  Your long-distance relationship can work ' even thrive ' with a little effort and creativity. Even if your partner is starting to feel a little distant, you can rekindle the love with a few romantic gestures and a lot of compassion.
-3	negative	loneliness	My boyfriend usually makes me wait whenever we're going to meetso i let him wait too whenever i go to washroom at malls :D i don't intend to do it, i really am just one of the queens who used to stay long at washrooms and take a bath for as long as 2 hoursminimum of 30 mins as my fastest in which i can only do shampoo my hair and that's all :D if i wash my bodyit would take more than 30 minutes :D (back to my boyfriend) the reason for this is because he will always ask me if i'm in one specific place where he will only go when i get there already. Althoughfor almost 3 years of us being togetherhe's now practicing to be as early as possible. He's considering the traffic, but always late, still!
-8	negative	loneliness	My brother is dating a controlling girlfriend and I hate her so much, she talks to much crap about people, she told me she lost respect for me because I played a song, she told me I was worthless, and she says I need to grow up because I tell my grandma that my brother and her are always on top of each other in his bed. I'm so sick of her..
-14	negative	loneliness	My cousin Charlie just passed away. I'm having a really hard time. He was a great, funny, amazing guy. He was only 18. He didn't deserve to pass that way. I basically grew up with him. Ever since we were little Charlie always had a nickname for me. "Hey Little Rainy." His voice still in my head. The times and memories we shared play through my head. As soon as i get close to forgetting about what happened it comes right back. To think my life couldn't hate me anymore than it didnow i have to live without my cousin &lt;3.   R.I.P. Charlie &lt;3 I love you &lt;3
-4	negative	loneliness	My cousin got in a car accident in 2000 which left him paralyzed. By January 2010, he was having issues. Both legs were amputated then bed soreshe lost the battle. He was 28.  Worst year of my life.
-1	negative	loneliness	My dad always told me to be number one. It seems like good advice, but it made me fear failure and worship success. Fear of failure translated into a fear of rejection in the social world. I don't take my dad's advice anymore, because there is so much more to life than success.
-4	negative	loneliness	My dad has cancer. I never thought it would be this hard. I just moved from SoCal to NorCal. I have no friends up here and I can only see my therapist every two months. I often times wish I would go to sleep and never wake up. I don't wish this on anybody.
-10	negative	loneliness	My dad left me for drugs. I love him and I forgive him, I'm just so hurt still. He came back today asking if I would talk to him. I didn't want to talk to him cause I probably would've said something I regret. I just ignored him. He was only here to get his stuff cause my mom threw him out. Idk what to do. He has chosen drugs over me and my family multiple times. I want to talk to him and tell him I forgive him but I don't want him to feel like it's to easy so he can leave and come when ever the heck he feels like it.  he's my dad And I love him
-17	negative	loneliness	My darling angel.  I miss you so much. You weren't with me for very long. I never got to hear your little heart beat, feel you wiggle and kick inside of me or hold you in my arms. I never knew whether you were a boy or girl (but I always had a feeling that you were my little man), got to see what color hair you had or whose nose you got. You were taken from me. I didn't know about you for very long, but from the moment I found out about you, I was madly in love. I wanted you more than anything. My heart is still broken. A piece of me is missing and it will never get put back together. I know you're still with me, watching over me and your siblings. You have saved me, more than once, little man. Not a single day goes by that I don't think of you and miss you and ache for you. You would have been two soon. Your due date was your grandma's birthday. She would have loved sharing that day with you. I will never stop missing you and thinking of you.  Love, your mommy
-14	negative	loneliness	My experience starts in the 90's, in the military, before the term PTSD was mainstream.  I find it so hard to deal with day to day crap.  Sometimes even minute to minute.  I find myself standing or sitting in one spot, not doing anything in particular, for long periods of time.  I have gone through many "phases".  The raging alcoholic, the functional opiate addict, the dysfunctional opiate addict, the recovering opiate addict, back to the functional opiate addict, blah, blah, blah.  Intermingled with varying degrees of depression and anxiety.        Well, by now, you get the point.  I just joined this site and these "generalities" are all I'm comfortable sharing right now.  If you see my profile pic and know what it is, talk to me.  Especially if you know first hand which, could be a wife, husband, girlfriend etc of someone struggling with this.  Whether we talk or not, I wish you well.
-5	negative	loneliness	My ex's mom died at the age of 14 and a year after I broke up with her, her dad died and I'm the only person she wants to lean towarda
-7	negative	loneliness	My family cares, but they're love is pretty much mandatory. I've always wanted someone to truly care. But though I've searched, my efforts have been in vain. What's the point of caring if nobody cares about me?
-4	negative	loneliness	My family is scattered around the South. My husband of 14 years and I live in a weird relationship. He is a cop and works strange hours. We have one son who is 11 and I homeschool for various regions. I enjoy teaching him new things, but the need for someone to talk to so overwhelming. I get very depressed and have to take meds just so I can make it through the day with out some one to talk to.
-2	negative	loneliness	My family is to busy with their friends. I want someone to hug me and just someone to hang out with. :'(
-1	negative	loneliness	My father died 7 years ago 
-4	negative	loneliness	My father would shout as loud as he could whenever he feels a little unhappy or when people has made / said / done something that he feels undesirable. He is a very hot tempered and rude father only when he is in bad mood. Certainly I have get affected physically and mentally. I feel like I will break the relationship in between us one day. I couldn't stand with him anymore. I couldn't forgive and forget everytime when this happened. This makes me feel really sad.  I wish he isn't my father
-7	negative	loneliness	My fianc and I just moved in. We have four children combined and everything is perfect. Except his ex-wife! They were together for ten years and was basically forced together because he got her pregnant as a minor. And after ten years she left him and their kids so she can party and gain her own independence. Plz help!
-1	negative	loneliness	My fianc ended his life one month ago. My mom and dad recently passed away about a year apart. I'm depressed and my family and friends have abandoned me due to severe depression they don't want to deal with it. I need a good friend.
-10	negative	loneliness	my friend move away to a different continent because her dad retired from the military and I guess there family lives there, but it was only once she was gone did I realize how much I truly love her. granted I was like 10 or 11 at the time but I can't stop thinking about her ever. I am 15 years old now and I have never been able to love someone else like how I loved her. I am just so lonely and probably will always be:/
-2	negative	loneliness	My friends get so upset at me because I never answer the phone when they call.. If they only knew how much anxiety it gives me. Simple conversation = the struggle, sighhh 
-8	negative	loneliness	My friends sister is turning her life upside down. She's smoking, smoking weed, drinking, and skipping class. My friend also smoked weed, She goes to a very bad school, and I just think her friends are having a bad influence on her. And her sisters friends too. Her parents know, and told her sister to stop, but she is still doing it and her parents don't know. But I know everything. I'm just wondering what i should do.. Should I tell my friend to tell her parents or should I do it, or should I tell her parents to put them in a different school!?
-7	negative	loneliness	My friend thinks that i am going crazy she think I'm not a werewolf and i am my eyes r blue but she cant see that i am lonely my best friend has become my enemy i am just sad why does it have to like this
-5	negative	loneliness	My girlfriend and I recently ended our relationship on thanksgivingwe were together for almost 3 years, and I see she has a new boyfriend alreadyand it's killing me..I'm so sad and hurt and jealous
-7	negative	loneliness	My girlfriend broke up with me because I wasn't religious enough. I'm 28 and she is the first girl I have ever loved and I feel is my soul mate   She says she feels the same way but needs a Christian man in her life.  I don't feel I can ever be that man because I don't beleive in religion. I still keep in contact with her I feel she uses me for emotional support. I'm also afraid I only want her back because she broke up with me and if I had her I would eventually move on. Sometimes I feel I'm incapable of love
-6	negative	loneliness	My girlfriend is overseas studying abroad for the semester, its been three weeks and I have three weeks before I get to go visit her, I feel really distraught and my mind races with things that she could be doing there, I call/skype her almost every night but as soon as I get off I slump back into feeling like crap
-3	negative	loneliness	My girlfriend left me in the start of December and  7 days before Christmas i lost my job. And i spent new year's eve alone. What terrible ending to 2013
-7	negative	loneliness	My grandfather has been my "dad" since I was a few months old. Our real father left us when I was just an infant. It's almost 5 years since my grandfather died and it's his birthday on the 27th.
-1	negative	loneliness	My grandma just passed away, feeling empty and lonely.
-5	negative	loneliness	my great grandmother passed away in 2005, and a couple of years later so did my great grandfather, soon afterward pennies started to show up in the oddest places, on the middle of the couch cushion, a freshly cleaned floor, in my brothers hat, even on my pillow. the pennies are always face up, and are either new or extremely shiny
-6	negative	loneliness	My husband and I fight consistently. To sleep in a bed and feel so alone with another soul next to me is exhausting. To not want to be held by the man I once considered my partner. Im starting to doubt we were ever partners.  Today will be a rough one. I will smile on the outside but I'm half dead within. I will focus on the light that's left.
-14	negative	loneliness	My husband and i we were looking forward on our 2nd daughter Maricela. I was in labour on september 28 and we headed to the hospital as the nurses checked for the fetal heartbeat they couldn't find it. N we got the worst news in our lives " sorry your baby has passed away ". I had a csection n i prayed that what they told me it was a lie that she would come out crying but no we didn't hear nothing. We decided not to have an autopsy done on her because she was so small and i was full term. Doctors told us there was a problem in my placenta but throughout my pregnancy i was fine no problems. But now she's in a better place while we are here devastated and heartbroken. Maricela C. September 28, 2013

And said he didn't want to eat, I tried to convince him to eat, but he went back to the couch all upset. I felt horrible and did not eat myself. I ask him why get upset why not help me look for other stuff to eat and make the best of it? He just kept telling me he wasn't hungry. I felt so bad, I asked him why he gets upset so quick????. I started crying and left to the room. He fall sleep in the couch

Now its time for us to start living as husband and wife Haha thats still weird when i say it; I'm so used to calling him my boyfriend :p . He's been home since saturday and its been nice so far.

-4	negative	loneliness	My life is a disaster right now. I would just love it if I found someone to talk to. Whether it be a girl or a guy.
-2	negative	loneliness	My lonliness and my depression has hit a fever pitch.This pain is very unreal and unbearable it hurts so * much ,please can anyone relate to this!.?p.s. No religious or smart  comments please
-6	negative	loneliness	My man is in Afghanistan now and won't be back until October. Some call it crazy, but I call it love. There are good days and bad days. Even good minutes and bad minutes. I think it's shameful when girls pretend they love a military man when all they do is complain and cheat. Be supportive and faithful! He's a hero. He should be yours.
-7	negative	loneliness	My marine graduates from his MOS school Friday and he's coming home on Wednesday and he gets to be home for 15 days. I'm so excited!!!! But all I can think about is the fact that he's gonna leave again and for longer. I don't wanna be down about that the whole time he's here but that's all I can think about. I'm not ready for him to leave and he ain't even here yet. 
-3	negative	loneliness	My marine has been training in the field for only 3 days now out of the 4 weeks he'll be there. we can barely talk when he's in the field. I miss him so much already. and he'll be gone 7 months from March when he gets deployed to Afghanistan. it's so hard to stay happy, I keep thinking about how much fun we had for 2 weeks for Christmas, and it makes me miss him so much more.
-3	negative	loneliness	My Marine is getting deployed in February. We've been dating for three years now and I'm going to miss him terribly. 
-1	negative	loneliness	My mom died when I was 18, over 18 years ago now. I'm getting married in September and it's been very difficult emotionally planning my wedding. I miss her soooo much and I feel as though the pain of loosing her is very fresh. I just wish she was here..She was my best friend. It's not fair!!!
-7	negative	loneliness	My mom has the mentality of 6 year old.  I love her dearly but she should not have had children if her own, let alone been able to adopt more!  She verbally and physically abused me till I got a job at 14, moved out with Dad at 16 when parents divorced.  Life was hell! The second he screws up enough, kids and I are out of there!!!!
-9	negative	loneliness	My mom is in ICU and I got my heart, not broken, but shredded tonight. I was dumb enough to fall deeply for someone prematurely, yet again. I did that years ago! Sick! I knew him less than 2 months maybe, and it already felt like I was in love with him. It's all over now. He expressed what I took as no reguard to whether myself or my mom lives or dies. What if I'd actually lost my virginity to someone heartless enough to come at me at a time like this? An example that men like my exes still exist and I need to be wary of them. I don't want someone who can't be real.
-8	negative	loneliness	My mom is the honest type, the really honest type.  maybe i was already expecting that answer but it wounded me a bit. She was never the type of mom that made me feel like the most special child in the world, and that's fair, I guess. Sometimes though, I want to feel as if I am, even if it's just to her.
-1	negative	loneliness	My mom left me when I was 10 and people hate me and I smetimes cut myself and have no friends..
-8	negative	loneliness	My mother just passed away on Sept. 24, 2013.  The whole day I was surrounded by butterflies.  The next day I was going about my day taking care of the funeral plans and I had seen so many pennies every where I was.  I have always known about "Pennies from Heaven".  To me by seeing and picking up all these pennies my mother was telling me that she has made it to heaven.  Thank you Mom, I miss u a lot.
-3	negative	loneliness	My mother lives with me. She is unbearable. She is a recovering addict and acts totally helpless and very manipulative.. I want her to go, get her own place. How do you throw your mom out?
-4	negative	loneliness	My mother passed away In 2009. In march of this year it will be five years. And frankly I'm going insane because i have been alone that long. I did not think life alone would be this bad. It makes haveing bipolar disorder a hundred times worse when there is no one to be with or talk to
-1	negative	loneliness	My name is Jen. Bit of a goth. Have a few friends but feel lonely.
-8	negative	loneliness	My name is Kevin, I live in Anchorage Alaska, I'm new to the experience, what brings me to experience, is I'm lonely, I was in an accident and was struck blind, four years ago, and the last four years, my life has changed dramatically,
-8	negative	loneliness	My one month of no communication with him has begun, I know because it's a weekend and I haven't heard from him and he didn't even say good bye. I guess this one of those get up and leave cases once again. I feel like crying but I feel like laughing at the same time. I want to cry because I wont hear from him for a month or maybe more, I feel like laughing because this is his last deployment and finally finally he comes home. I can feel some big changes coming in my life and I think I'm gonna be happy about it. 
-8	negative	loneliness	My only joy in life is all internal. At this point in life, it's good to say I don't have any friends. Due to my medical condition, I can't do any normal stuff, preventing me to make any friends. My old friends still think of me as their friends, but we have drifted far away from each other so much. They didn't intentionally push me away. It's just that between us there is this giant wall that is my medical condition. Well to be fair, I still have one old friend that has been by my side all through these years. But then again, his family moved and so there isn't any face-to-face interaction. I just wish he could come back
-13	negative	loneliness	My only real best friend was my grandma but she died from cancer the day before mothers day 1 yr ago. I became friends with this girl and I thought she was my best friends but it turns out she was talking about me behind my back to everyone. All I want is a friend that I can talk to and have a fun time with without any drama. Is that to much to ask for? I'm a very nice person and really funny once you get to know me and I'm always there for people when they need someone 
-1	negative	loneliness	My parents are great at these.  Not referring to anyone on here, just a couple of people I know in real life!
-3	negative	loneliness	My parents recently split up (not divorced, but they needed time apart) and now they are getting back together again. I really need someone to talk to about this.
-2	negative	loneliness	My partner eats really unhealthy food and it  annoys me that he doesn't bother that much about his well being. Do I have grounds to actually find that annoying? Or am I being unnecessarily fussy.
-2	negative	loneliness	My partner Has HIV. I don't.he also has terminal cancer.  As a result we no longer have a physical relationship. Is it completely wrong that I've started a physical relationship with someone else? I have the emotional connection with my boyfriend but I feel the need for physical closeness with someone too.
-12	negative	loneliness	My partner is going through a divorce and there is a child involved. He had told me over the last 6 months that the papers were under control and were being taken care of. At Xmas I found out that the papers hadn't even been downloaded. He told me he was scared of losing the child. I have given him an ultimatum to get the papers sent off by the end of the month (7 months since telling me the divorce was going through ok) or he will lose me. I get excuses all the time but don't know what's reasonable to expect of the situation. I don't think my partner is a bad person but he hasn't shown me any respect over the situation and doesn't understand why I am stressed and upset with the lies, afterall it's got nothing to do with me right?! What's reasonable to expect of someone who is divorcing but lying and dragging it out?
-6	negative	loneliness	My sisters told me that he has a boyfriend and it's been goin on for couple years. A week ago one my friends told me. Am really annoyed that's I've been told before my sister told me! Am really angry and want to go smash the guys face in!!
-11	negative	loneliness	My soldier and highschool sweetheart and I have had our upsand downs without a doubt. He is on his third tour in the sandbox right now. Im in college and we havent really been able to be together besides leave and weekend vacations in 3 years.. Ill be done with school next December and although it gets "easier" having been through basic, spec ops schools and 2 previous deployments I feel like im losing hope here. I never thought I would ever contemplate my abilities to be be the future solid military wife he deserves. I want him, I just dont want his career anymore. Just feeling so confused lately and feeling distant with the once a week phone calls. Which is a huge improvement from last deployment. Sigh* Anyway im glad to have found some ladies who can relate!
-8	negative	loneliness	my soldier just returned home and he is definitely not the same man I sent away! starting to doubt I still mean anything to him ppl say it takes time but he is being out rt hurtful by vanishing for hours on end with no communication! it was his first deployment and some personal issues play a role too but I have been here and hope that he still wants me to be! :-(
-1	negative	loneliness	My son was killed on November 14 2013 it hurts so much I can't even think he was my best friend and busy we did so much together if not for god I would not want to live this life any more
-2	negative	loneliness	My step family are a group of people who I really honestly detest. They are some of the worst people and get me down all the time. I just can't find myself up and happy lately with them around. I try everything I can to be away from them. I'll even request to work on days we have family events with them. How do I stay positive around so many negative people?
-6	negative	loneliness	My Story   the reason I have depression is cuz I have PTSD for those who don't know what that is its Post Tramaic Stress Disordor. I got while I was im the army in Iraq back in 2004. the stuff I seen there would make your head turn. that ii have it 
-4	negative	loneliness	My uncle took suicide four years ago today. I was really sad at school today and I wanted one of my friends to notice it and ask me, because I really need someone right now, but no one did. I need help. I am crying alone in my room. My family do not know I care this much.
-7	negative	loneliness	My whole life, I have always been the strong one. I am the one who is always there for everybody else, even to my own detriment. I am the person who will give you the shirt off my back, knowing full well that I may just freeze to death without it. I put my feelings, my needs and my emotions on the back burner so that others may benefit from the kindness, love and generosity that I have (and I have so much of it to offer!) ;-) I'm tired of being the rock for everyone else. Where's my rock?
-9	negative	loneliness	My wife and I are going through a seperation at the moment . 2 weeks I made 2 attempts of suicide and ended up in hospital for 2 weeks . Just out last night. I was admitted on the Friday night and on the Saturday my wife came to see me so I asked her for another chance and she said no . Then on the Sunday she came to see me and told me that we should give it another try that she still loved me then the following Wednesday week she changed her mind again . Am totally confused at the moment . Anyone ever have this experience and what was the outcome . Thanks Kevin
-9	negative	loneliness	My wife has cheated on me with 2 guys over the last 3 1/2 years. I found out about the first one in June if 2011. I stayed with her trying to work on our marriage. Dec. 19 2013 I found out he was back in the picture for almost a year and another guy for almost 2 years. I'm so lost, lonely, afraid and angry. I have 4 kids ages 9-17.  Wife says she wants to stay and work it out :-(
-3	negative	loneliness	My wife was hit and abused my her x,any guy that hits a woman is nothing but scum I hate them and my father used to hit my mum and I hated him for that they are nothing but the lowest of the low.
-3	negative	loneliness	My wife wrote on here about our daughters few days agonow I want to get my feelings out . Did we do something to deserve her being taken from us? She was and still is our everything. I miss her so much. And Ni does too. This just isn't fair
-3	negative	loneliness	Need Advice? Some1 2 Listen? No Judgement..I Am Here I am not judgemental, I do not criticize, i am here for all people no matter race, religion, sexuality nor will i belittle your issues as too small or "not that big of a deal" as i know first hand that each struggle can seems unbearable. If you need a friend, I am here. xoxo 
-1	negative	loneliness	Need new friends someone that will understand and talk  everyone is welcomed.
-10	negative	loneliness	Need your advice. Went out with a group of friends and one who we are sort of talking I guess. Everything went well we had some drinks got drunk but still felt in control. After we were leaving we hugged then looked at each other smiled and got really close to kiss but she pulled away. Why do you think that is ? I'm confused and now I'm over thinking it. What do you guys think?
-1	negative	loneliness	Nobody ever seems to want to talk to me.. Maybe I'm just really boring? Or ugly? I don't know but it is really frustrating.
-2	negative	loneliness	Nobody gets me. I feel like I'm in a whole other world from everyone I know because we really cannot relate to one another. I don't fit in anywhere in the social caste of my school, and it's not that I'm weird or anything. I just have more differences than commonalities with pretty much everyone.
-2	negative	loneliness	Nobody likes me, I can never hold a conversation. Now I'm emotionally numb, wishing I had just one friend I could talk to
-1	negative	loneliness	Nobody really knows the real me&nbsp;
-2	negative	loneliness	No friends no school just a family that beats and molests me that is my life I intend to end
-4	negative	loneliness	No I'm not. Though, I'd like to be one. Everyone says it's hard and everything I mean, I could definitely understand that. My brother spent years inside the army, and it wasn't easy. I could just imagine with a mate how it'd feel like, but I'm willing to take the risk.
-4	negative	loneliness	No matter what I do or how I try, its never enough for my husband. Its always that he is going through a difficult time at work and starts blaming me for being sad and needing time to get over our fights that start with his frivolous/callous comments. How many times I tell him to stop and yet he keeps nailing me about his unhappiness and how patient he has been with me! All I ask is for time to get over the previous one and he keeps adding to it, day after day even in the 3hrs that we see each other. Is it all worth it?
-3	negative	loneliness	No matter where I am. Also my brain always says no one likes you people would enjoy themselves more if you left so I normally just get up and go sit somewhere by myself because that's what I'm used to. And I've been told I am unwanted before so that doesn't make my anxiety better I feel alone and like people keep me around only out of pity.
-1	negative	loneliness	No matter who or how many people are there, I feel like I simply can not fit in.. I'm always that one like walking behind two friends on a sidewalk kinda deal and I'm never the first choice. It hurts.
-1	negative	loneliness	No negativity today I just would like a conversation
-3	negative	loneliness	No one ever listens to me and then people wonder why I never talk.
-6	negative	loneliness	No one knows how much I try to keep a smile on my face and even being happy. Truth is, I've cut, thought about suicide, and I've tried running away a couple times. What do I do wrong ? I mean I've tried to be good, but no one cares.
-3	negative	loneliness	no one notices me even if i die no one cares i have friends but they are totally selfish i want some one to talk to
-2	negative	loneliness	No one should be used to being broken up with, it should be a heart breaking experience and something that happens. I've been left so many times that I'm used to it. And that's sad
-2	negative	loneliness	No Ones Lonely Trust Me, Everyone Has The Point In Time Thinking That, But It's Not True, BELIEVE Y'll
-3	negative	loneliness	Not gonna lie, I read some peoples stories and wanna tell them how amazing they are for being able to get through what they do but I get lazy and just end up heart-ing it. As a matter of fact this is kinda long for me now. Lol phones and texting  id rather talk lol
-10	negative	loneliness	Not having any kind of social life has caused my life to revolve around my boyfriend which puts a strain our relationship. Other than him all I have to look forward to is hanging out with my twin sister. Don't get me wrong, I love her, but it's totally different to have friends outside of family. I got to this point by growing away from my child hood friends who simply put are "ghetto" by turning "emo"(big change!) with new and fewer friends but like most teens who go through such a phase I grew away from that into my natural self leaving me friendless.  
-9	negative	loneliness	Nothing gives me jitters quite like the idea of my man leaving. He's both my boyfriend and my best friend so saying goodbye will be the hardest thing I will ever do. So far we've decided that we won't doing anything rash, like get married right away because when I turn eighteen we will already be through the first year apart. We figure the he'll come home when his time is up and we'll just pick up where we left off. Nothing scares me quite as much as this. Well I guess my rant is over. Any advice would be helpful.
-1	negative	loneliness	Nothing good ever comes from a bucket. That is all there is there to say. 
-4	negative	loneliness	Nothing irritates me more than a family member who thinks they are better than everyone else or their opinion matters more. Grr grr & grr
-3	negative	loneliness	not in the bad "Sad" kind of lonely (Though I used to be three years ago; I know how it feels) but kind of the "I'm bored and have been for the past few days"
-1	negative	loneliness	Not knowing that it was the last hug I would give my closest friend and that I couldn't always be there for her beats me up everyday.  Nothing seems real, like jumping in and out of reality not knowing which is which in the end.
-2	negative	loneliness	Not lonely as in I have nobody. I'm blessed with some amazing people in my life. The search continues 
-1	negative	loneliness	Not necessarily looks but my likes and dislikes
-1	negative	loneliness	Not to complain to or for advise though. I just need someone who will listen as I go on and on about my lovely girlfriend. Seems people don't like to listen to me talk and talk and talk about her all day long (weird).
-4	negative	loneliness	now i am lonely.from the previes days i didnot like this lonelyness but now a days it is giving lot of supper experience for me because i can lean manythings from internet.At the same time i can feel i am freebird now so l like this lonelyness all the .i am beliving one think that is all is well all is well
-1	negative	loneliness	Now listen I really need someone to talk to on here  I am a meth users & don't know how to stop I just could use someone to no judge me and just to talk to me 
-3	negative	loneliness	I was never bullied until I reached High School, my first experience with other children my age. I feel like this describes the experience pretty well.
-9	negative	loneliness	October 9, 1964 I gave birth to my first child, a wonderfully beautiful son named Joey. I have to smile when I type his name Joey--I was the only one who he would allow to call him that as he got older. I smile at a lot of things about that boy. He was a very kind, loving son, very smart, but sadly he never believed that. Oh how I wish he had believed me and the many other people who reminded him often of his talents and his abilities.
-15	negative	loneliness	Oh man, I've been afraid of this my whole life. It scares the bejebus out of me. When I was little I had no friends at school and got made fun of continuously for being a chubby little girl ( I wasn't even that chubby, my school was just full of very cruel children) so I always stayed in the corners and didn't talk to people. Then I got my first friend and I was SO HAPPY. You wouldn't believe how excited I was to have sleepovers and share secrets and do all that fun stuff. But it turns out she was feeding all my secrets to the kids that liked to make fun of me and she saw me as a means to an end. That end being popularity I guess. Even though we were super young. Since then, it's been hard for me to do things that might end in rejection because I seem to get my hopes so high and then when I get rejected from whatever I'm trying to get into it all comes crashing down on me. I'm working on it though, slowly I'm getting braver and able to move on after rejection.
-6	negative	loneliness	Okay here we go: I'm alittle chubby I guess I've gained a few pounds this year cause I'm an emotional eater.. And as I'm growing older it feels like boys will always like the skinner girls and will always go to them.. I feel like I'm gonna have to lose wieght for a boy to like me.. So sick of this.
-5	negative	loneliness	Okay so.  My boyfriend and I have been together for a year yesterday. And we just got engaged a little over a week ago. Ever since he got back to ft. Benning he's been so distant with me and he has barely held a conversation or showed any type of care. He acted like yesterday was just an ordinary day, yet it was our one year. He's about to start rasp sometime soon but he's really not THAT busy to not even send me good morning texts or call me for like 5 minutes. What do I do?? I haven't been handling this very well.
-13	negative	loneliness	Okay so I need opinions. I absolutely adore my boyfriend and love him. Just wanted to make that clear. So last night was the first night he was able to drink at tec school and he called me. He said he dance and played pool. As a joke I said oh you danced with all those AF girls huh? And he's all like no, but if I did I wouldn't tell you anyways. I was extremely shocked with his answer. And really really bothered. I hung up on him. He asked me what's he said last night (because I was ignoring his calls). When I told him he said he didn't mean it and must of meant something different. I'm still really bothered about it. Should I be? Or should I believe him and move on from it? Help!!
-2	negative	loneliness	Okay, this has been going on for years now. I have always felt like my personality is a problem and I am not accepted but others. I feel so secluded all of the time. In school tomorrow I am about to be jumped by a number of people which enters double digits. I am alone and have no one.
-2	negative	loneliness	Okay well I don't but my boyfriend just joined because I encouraged him to because I thought he could benefit from this. He only has one experience so far but it explains his main problem. I don't know could maybe some of you find him (how do you do that) and maybe try to talk to him? He's convinced that no one can help him out. Ignore his stupid name but it's BarryMcCocknhur -_-
-1	negative	loneliness	Ok listen it's 5 am been at work since 130 am and I am bored need someone to talk to!!! Ladies talk to me I answer questions talk abt life anything!! Just cure my boredom!!
-11	negative	loneliness	ok so me and my best friend were fine until i posted a stupid status on facebook that said i only need one friend at the moment with all thats going on and that status was about my other best friend tj and not my best friend paige so she flipped out and she unfriended me and blocked me on facebook so now i only have 3 friends but only one of them is my best friend and thats tj..
-2	negative	loneliness	Ok so please bare with me, i will try an explain this as much as i can. To me this is confusing and i dont know how. I am not stupid could there have been  technical fault. Or has he just played me?
-9	negative	loneliness	Ok so say you dated a girl when you were 16 for 2 years (destiny) and left her for another girl (Sara) and dated Sara for 2 years then left her for destiny lol then dated for a couple years then left her AGAIN for another girl (me) then date me for 2 years and went back to destiny ? !? Lol what's going through this kids head!!
-4	negative	loneliness	Once upon a time, I had one. I used to go out with my friends, babysit for additional money, spend time in libraries and Barnes & Noble, get invited to parties. I used to do extra curricular activities and people used to tell me I was intelligent and full of potential all the time. What I'm wondering is, what did I do to deserve this in the first place?
-10	negative	loneliness	Once you have been rejected it takes a toll on youi have friends who have been rejected most of their lives and it is very sad too have this feeling, you dont trust anyone.   Anyone who is sincere you do not believe them.    I can pinpoint someone who has been rejected because the way they actits like they are open, but not reallyits our job too help rejected people, making the realize they are worth it, helping them, show them the difference rejection and not being rejected.    Someone who has been rejected is so sensitive that if you say something in jest they will be hurt.  We have too help them not turn them away.   
-2	negative	loneliness	One day, you will feel like a loser. Not any type of loser, but the one who lost it all. Maybe I am still that loser- that failure. But I just dont want to be the failure, loser AND quitter. Two is enough.
-9	negative	loneliness	One in five women miscarry their first pregnancy. One in five. And I had to be that one. I'm never the one to win the lottery or to have my name drawn from a hat, but when it came to filling the quota for miscarriages, I was that one. Not one of the four. THE ONE!!!  I've asked God so many times why it was me and not one of my three colleagues at work. Or why it was not the girl next door who continues to smoke throughout her pregnancy. But I'm not getting any answers. My husband and I have decided to finish the nursery because it's something to keep me busy and to remind me that there is a rainbow at the end of all our sorrow. At the moment time is my worst enemy and I'm just scraping by day by day. I so badly want to fall pregnant again. It's hard to watch as my body transforms back to its pre-pregnancy self. I know that another baby won't replace this one but I hope that it will bring me some relief from all the disappointment and pain. 
-2	negative	loneliness	one might argue we're not that valuable.  so you have to ask yourself: where does your control begin and end ? do you even have any kind of control ?
-6	negative	loneliness	One month ago today I saw my handsome Airman boyfriend graduate basic. Hugging him for the first time was the most amazing feeling in the world. I wish I could relive that day over and over! If your going to your mans graduation enjoy every minute! Because it's over before you know it and unfortunately he will be gone even faster. Enjoy every second you spend with him and love all that you do together. I miss my man like crazy and I only have 69 days until I see him! Stay strong ladies!!
-1	negative	loneliness	One more kiss. And yet it never feels like enough.
-4	negative	loneliness	One night it was like nothing was around. I kind of drifted away and transcended into this different person i laid there at cut nonstop until i was satisfied with how much blood i saw.
-1	negative	loneliness	Online drinking buddies? :D My interests are kitties, weight loss/diet, internet, games, shopping, fashion, joking around (sometimes not so tastefully), if you are interested message me! 
-4	negative	loneliness	ONLY 10 DAYS TILL I LEAVE FOR CALI to see my baby! I HAVE a question about family day though for anyone who can help me out I wanted to wear a cute dress on family day and my customized marines girl sweater on the day of his graduation. Howeverr I've heard from others that it's the opposite, comfy on family day and formal on graduation. But I want to wear my customized sweater on that day ughhh idk I'm trying on outfits tonight but does anyone know??? does it even matter?? Soo EXCITED&lt;3 It's only 10 days I'm gunna see how fast these 10 days go by cuz that's how much time off he gets oh welll at least I get to see him&lt;333 but yeah someone help me out with the whole family day thing!!!
-1	negative	loneliness	Only when you're lonely do you see loneliness in others
-4	negative	loneliness	On May 10 I got the call that changed my life my big brother was killed in a car accident. I still find it hard to accept even though I know it's true.  I can't sleep as I think of him. This is rough
-1	negative	loneliness	On Sunday October 6th 2013 I went into labor at 21 weeks into my pregnancy.  
-7	negative	loneliness	On the computer, it's a lot different, but in real life speaking to another person is so difficult that I just don't even try, really. I'll never initiate a conversation with someone I feel is a stranger. They talk first or it's just going to be awkward silence from there on. And even when they talk, I just don't say much. I have a tendency to stumble over my words and not have the ability to clearly think as I speak and I'm one of those blushers that has their whole face light up like a Christmas light so I just stare at the table the entire time. I've been ridiculed by my family on occasion for my fairly anti-social behavior. I get the feeling they just tease and don't seriously mean it, but for them to laugh at me for my fears hurts. I'm afraid of messing up a conversation, for being too afraid to carry it out, for being worried they'll reject me for a lot of reasons.
-7	negative	loneliness	penny for your thoughts?  how i wish someone can ask me that. its been 8-9 months since ive had an actual conversation with anyone. its hard moving to a new place without your friends. im at a stay at home dad so i barely get to go out and make friends. i do talk to my wife but its always the same thing over and over and shes tired at times to even have a conversation with me. i totally understand that. but i just wish i had someone that could ask me how things are and end up with a good conversation.
-8	negative	loneliness	People are always lonely I don't know why but I think I'm meant to be alone for the rest of my life. I guess life is pointless everyone is going on with there lives while I sit here trying to pass the time by. No one would care if I'm gone. I think killing myself is the easiest way out of this pain. Am I weak for thinking this way? Why do people even live? Why were we born in the first place? When I read other stories about people and how happy they are it makes me sick I want to be happy to But I'm cursed with agony, and hatred.
-1	negative	loneliness	People are leaving me on ep! I need someone to talk to.I'm just addicted to the use of it now! I need someone to talk tosomeone who's a good listener..communicator.with whom I could mix up easily
-1	negative	loneliness	People read my experiences and shoot me in the right direction !
-9	negative	loneliness	People think depression is sadness. People think depression is crying. People think depression is dressing in black. But people are wrong. Depression is the constant feeling of being numb. Being numb to emotions, being numb to lying.  You wake up in the morning just to go to bed again. Days arent really days; they are just annoying obstacles that need to be faced. And how do you face them? Through medication, through drinking, through drugs, through cutting. When you're depressed, you grasp onto anything that can get you through the day.  That is what depression is, not sadness or tears, its the overwhelming sense of numbness and the desire for anything that can help you make it from one day to the next.
-1	negative	loneliness	People think that I am a social and popular guy but I feel lonely all the time
-3	negative	loneliness	Perferable 14-18. I just want a friend. c: Someone I can talk to about anything. Message me, lovelies? &lt;3
-2	negative	loneliness	Persistently last night, I began pondering on society all over. How do they bear at this moment? Undeviating, this is an announce for individuals who endure lonlieness. We must remain in force for the inaudible.  Much love and warmth! &lt;3
-2	negative	loneliness	Personally I don't like crowds. I feel uncomfortable in places with many peoble with an unpredictable behaviour. I've only been to a couple of big concerts (Bob Dylan in 1980, San Fransisco) and one of my favourite groups, Camel, maybe about a year later (probably not a "big" concert, but I loved it!). A couple of years later I participated in an ani-nuclear arms demonstration with 20 thousand people. I thought that was awesome, to be a part of something bigger than myself, a brotherhood of fellow men and women.  
-2	negative	loneliness	Pet peeves in this area: 2 - People who tell me to be more assertive - but then get all bent out of shape when I'm assertive with THEM.
-4	negative	loneliness	Please message me for my snapchat so you can add me and entertain me!!!!! NO PERVERTS!! I'm begging!!
-1	negative	loneliness	Please message me if you can help. I might have a lot of problems though that I need to talk about So be prepared. I'm sorry in advance.
-3	negative	loneliness	Please, somebody help me. I just want to be loved. And I believe that I am worth it.
-2	negative	loneliness	Plz I am all alone on this site  So girls between age 14-17 plz add me
-6	negative	loneliness	 I am new and don't know how to really participate.  I have posted twice and had no replies.  I have replied to several posts and see lots of other people responding.  Do you have to friend people?  I am just looking for others to talk to as I feel so cut off from my family and friends like we have nothing in common any more.  I just want to know there are others out there like me.
-1	negative	loneliness	Positive energy makes life worth living!
-1	negative	loneliness	Ppl freak when I tell i am Arab & living in am Arabic country (from my mom)
-2	negative	loneliness	Preferably a girl around my age. Not because i am looking for perverted stuff or anything like that but because i enjoy talking to people my own age and normally my issues require a female's perspective. I have no insomniac friends and late at night  is when my problems bug me the most.
-4	negative	loneliness	Pretty lonely would love to keep someone's company or someone to keep me company. Either way don't be shy I'm nice gal.  &lt;3
-9	negative	loneliness	Ranger school is almost over!! Hopefully he passes Florida phase and graduates later in January. So what's next? PCS to Fort Bragg, airborne training, deployment. We've talked about getting engaged and me moving up to Bragg with him but that won't be til he gets back from being deployed and we are together a little longer. It's all so exciting and scary all at once. But for the first time my heart and head both tell me the same thing, be patient and great things are in the future 
-1	negative	loneliness	Really I'm kinda craving the guy who was touching me today in school. I can't stop thinking about. Ugh I hope he does it again.
-1	negative	loneliness	Really need advice on relationships and a bunch of other things. Feel free to message me. Don't be creepy. Prefer people in my age group. Thanks
-2	negative	loneliness	Really want to send and receive good old fashioned hand written letters, so if anyone's interested in posting letters let me know. 
-4	negative	loneliness	Recently one of my close friends asked me out (I said no because I'm just not into her like that) and she hasn't talk to since thenshould I try starting a conversation with her? I just don't want thing to be awkward between us
-17	negative	loneliness	Recently, one of my good friend here in ep just deleted his account. Well, he said that he had many accounts before and he deleted them but ended up making another one. But the last acc that he had, he told me that he created it for me bc i was someone he could talk to. I thought i have finally found someone that appreciated me and treated me as a friend that means something to him. Buti was wrong. We didn't talk for a few days , i guess its bc of our respective busy schedules. And when i went to my inbox just now, i found his acc deleted. Why does everyone treat me this way? They make you feel appreciated and how you want to feel and then suddenly, leave you behind When can i ever find the friend that i need? 
-5	negative	loneliness	Rejection is a tough thing to come to terms with. I am someone who has been rejected for my entire life, by almost everyone that I have known. This is a result of my straight to the point, annoying, weird, and goofy attitude. Society brings people up to reject these sorts of things - and so, as a result of being rejected, I have always feared it, to the point that where I am now is in complete isolation from being in any sort of situation where rejection in the real world is possible.
-2	negative	loneliness	Restarting everyday is what it feels like and never reaching the end.
-4	negative	loneliness	Right now I am going through a hard time, no one gets no one understand me, I am having trouble finding a job, what is there to life when we try to hang on to hope but we burn out, what is there more to life than we see I am guess I need a miracle to happen,
-20	negative	loneliness	Right now i just had a heated argument with my brother. The reason i call him my brother is because i have been close with him since he visited america from his motherland years ago. Recently his father passed away. My mother took him in and he has been very ungrateful and disrespectful it gets worst everyday. Then he sleeps in my room and i told him i dont want people in my house and when i came from school i entered my room with four people in it smoking marijuana and i told him wtf! I thought i told you something yesterday. And he screamed at me and told our friends i didnt want noone here. So now our friends looked at me funny and my brother doesnt talk to me. I need someone to tell me am i wrong for wanting respect in my room & was he suppose to throw me under the bus like that. Message me or comment please and thank you.
-7	negative	loneliness	Right now it hurts so bad. It's amazing how real and visceral this longing can be like a thousand needles stabbing through my heart. I am trying to improve myself every day. I am exercising, reading more, getting into mediation, becoming ok with who I am and my belief system, but when these pangs come as strong as they do, it's hard to even stand.  Is it so hard to find a friend or a lover or some people to spend time with? Is there no consistent people that can fulfill this need? I strive to find them. I hope it is not in vain
-6	negative	loneliness	Right now, the only rejection I am afraid of is not being able to land a job when I am finally done with college. I hear accounting a good field and all, but the fear is still there. It's also because my husband's job requires us to move fairly frequently, so I am concerned about that, too. I just want to start at one place and stay forever! 
-2	negative	loneliness	Sadness and depression fills my heart, And she'll never see this part of me, I go unnoticed like a flea If only she truly loved me
-5	negative	loneliness	Sat in the dark, trying to sleep. Just wondering whether there is a reason I've been put here, is it too suffer? Is it to accomplish things? Or just too see how long it takes me too crack and end everything?
-6	negative	loneliness	Saying they are interested, they really want to know me and its okay whatever it is cause they will still accept me then Okay when i confess the truth about what i am, they dont like anymore. See, now i know who is true and really want to be my friend. I dont see any wrong to be holy! So they want me to live normal doing sin in moral?.
-1	negative	loneliness	School doesn't make me learn. It just makes me sad
-5	negative	loneliness	Seems like everyone has their close friends and I am alone. People say they are there from me, but where are they now?!
-3	negative	loneliness	Seems like when I talk to him on the phone or face time it may actually make me miss him more  I just can't wait until I know if he can come home or not :/
-3	negative	loneliness	Selenophobia. I am scared of the moon. ONLY when it is like yellow or red. The moon holds or attracts energy and power and it scares me. 
-4	negative	loneliness	Shallow people do not quench our souls. This is why you can be surrounded by people and still feel lonely. Find people that can relate to you and develop meaningful relationships with them. If you find yourself constantly chatting about petty crap, chances are one or both of you are shallow. Share your fears, share your ideas, share your loves. You may be surprised.
-3	negative	loneliness	Sick and tired of being treated like crap from my boyfriend, he took away all my friends, calls me names, pushes me aroundI Just need someone to take my mind off of him.
-2	negative	loneliness	Sigh I'm alone tonight Haven't felt like this in awhile. Can someone  tell a joke or something???!!!!
-6	negative	loneliness	Since I am home alone with my child and we live in a rural area, I have very few friends. My husband monitors my phone and checks it regularly to see with whom I have been talking. I wish I had more people to talk to and visit with.
-8	negative	loneliness	Since I've told a girl (who loved me) that I have been lying on my gender and identity on the internet, I feel lonely and I get to miss her so much. The thing is, I have a question that always run through my mind, would she love me again for the real me? Even though I have been lying to her during two years.. Could she forgive me?
-1	negative	loneliness	Sitting here alone while everyone in my house is asleep (my kids). My husband works nights and long hours and most weekends. Most days we only see each other for an hour or two. I need someone to talk to very lonely  another sleepless night
-2	negative	loneliness	Sitting in my car on my college campus I see rain falling down my windshield Reflecting on the day I left him for cheating on me.
-12	negative	loneliness	Small bit of history before I go into this. I struggle with depression. Extreme, put-me-in-the-loony-bin depression. I also do not get close to people. I'm the person who ignores people who try to get too close to me. It's happened in every single relationship I've ever been in. My last one only lasted so long because we were both so guarded that we didn't truly open up until about 8 months in, and like clockwork, that's when I started pulling away. So that's the background. Can someone relate? How are you dealing with it? How did you get past it? Please help me with some advice.
-4	negative	loneliness	SMH  another lonely weekend night with nothing to do & nobody to do nothing with :P I thought by now I'd be use to it but yet there is still an emptiness in my chest. BLAH :P oh well maybe I'll watch a movie

It was good, i went on like normal, i don't know who was direction me, but it was different then my so call normal day after the lost of my son, i went and finished his flower garden, wow it looks very very good, i'm proud of my self, i know my sons proud that his ma gots his sun flowers to grow, after i finished i went to do a little shopping and i looked around and checked out the prices like i used to do, not just rushing in and hurrying to get out.

-2	negative	loneliness	So having no family around me and no real friends to talk to i work go to school and sit at home and i am just wishing i had someone to talk to and share feelings and thoughts with 
-2	negative	loneliness	So he feels like I'm holding him back from training before basic right now. I keep telling him I support him and want him to do what makes him happy. What can I do to show him that I really so support him?
-4	negative	loneliness	So i had another fight with the family. I'm at my limit. Had a fight with a wall to stop me going mad. My hands and arms hurt. I'm in the dark hugging a pillow in a ball on the bed. Crying. No gas or electric or anything. Monday to talk to.
-14	negative	loneliness	So I have finally made a decision about my bf. We haven't spoken in almost 6 months because he was switched into doing other work. Yes he is deployed in Afghan but idk what is going on I sent him,  his commanding officer and his friends email asking him what is going on. AND I GET NOTHING!!!!! I am pretty sure most of you can relate to this waiting g around for days for an answer,  for an email,  phonecall,  text anything to get you to feel hopeful. But I am tired going through the months on nothing feeling my heart hurting more and my brain not being able to focus. So I sent him and his friend an email saying I was going to wait until the new year then I would be moving on. I dont get into relationships fast so if anytime he wants to talk to me I will be there I will be glad to talk to him because I love him and I will always love him. But I just cant deal with getting my hope up and then getting let down. Am I doing the right thing??

-12	negative	loneliness	So I haven't been on here a while, but last time i found this so helpful. My boyfriend was deployed in Afghanistan in 2012 and i found it really difficult, we had only been together 8 months at the time. Now he has gone again. He left yesterday and i thought it would be easier this time because i knew i could handle it, but its so much harder and i literally feel unable to cope. We've been together a few years now and I'm used to him being there, especially since we live together. I feel so bad because I'm just a wreck and I'm finding this impossible, while my boyfriend is the one out in another country fighting. I'd love some advice or just a chat! I just feel as if it's all a joke and he will be home from work soon. The thought of the next few months without him breaks my heart. Thanks in advance 
-13	negative	loneliness	So i kinda need some advice, im pregnant and hormonal so for me its really hard to tell if im over reacting, anyone last night i went to my bfs xmas partyy with him and everything was, we actually had a really good day, then all of a sudden a female co worker comes in, he looks really shocked, and they both look at each other in a way he has never looked at me, and says i didn't think you were going to be here.. He was all shocked.. I got really upset just that look got to me, hes never told me about her, and he told me its cause i never asked? Well i never go to his work so how do you ask about something you dont know.. And it also made me realize he used to text me alot an has since slowed down and is delayed on replys I havent really said a word The look ive never seen him do before ever and how he responded to her Am i going crazy
-10	negative	loneliness	So, I'm 13, in year 9, I've only really started to have severe anxiety problems since Starting high school, I used to have them before bit they weren't as bad then. I had 3 years of non stop bullying, I used to be lied to, I hate going to school and have panic attacks when I arrive. I can't go out on my own, I have to go with someone and I don't eat breakfast or lunch, I only eat 1 meal a day cos I'm never hungry. All the bullying and stress lead me to self harm, which I did that for 3 years, I'm over that now cos the bullying seems to have stopped, but I was diagnosed with Anxiety disorders and possible bipolar, but I'm getting help now.  Michael.
-10	negative	loneliness	So I'm a senior in high school and everybody, including the teachers, are very supportive on my relationship. As an "engagement gift" my English teacher had my fianc get on Skype. I was told we would be skyping with kids from another school, since we do that a lot. When I walked into the classroom I saw my handsome man on the big screen, singing to me. My teacher and all the students in that class set it all up and even pulled money together for a relaxing week on the ocean in the most beautiful beach house I've ever seen. &lt;3 I love my Marine and everyone who supports us. This honestly made my entire month. lol. 
-9	negative	loneliness	So I'm here at home, alone. My brother is gonna stay in the hospital and I'm not sure what time is my mom will be coming home. Here, drinking some red wine that my mom used to drink. Drinking alone lol. I'm not sharing this to brag or something and I'm not faking it. I just wanna share this experience and for me this site is like my diary. I'm not really an alcoholic person but in some special occasions, I am. But now, I just feel drinking and I want to temporarily forget my problem for once.
-17	negative	loneliness	So, I'm in a top math class and I haven't been doing so great, I know the math I just make stupid mistakes I tell my parents this but they never listen they brought in tutors to help me and they say the same things, it's just stupid mistakes I got a 69 on a test m, my teacher didn't give it back for a week. I go to a chess club with some friends to have fun. My mom flips when I tell her I stayed for chess now she is making me stay for math everyday and my teacher only helps those who don't need help. I tell her that but she still doesn't listen. I just needed to tell someone this. Thanks for reading.
-1	negative	loneliness	So I'm new to this site as well as being married to my marinewas hoping anyone had some tips on anything really
-4	negative	loneliness	So im not feeling down or anything quite happy but if there are any non closeted gays/bi's/lesbians who have already came out to their friends and family can some of yous inbox me ? its not to hook up or anything i just need a little bit of motivation to tell my friends and family about the "new me" lol. So please lewl 
-11	negative	loneliness	So I'm sitting at home doing laundry and cleaning, and all the sudden my phone went off. It was him, he text me!!!!! And what he said made this whole thing worth the wait. All he said was less than a month. Which means he'll be home soon and we can really get our relationship fully going. I can't wait to see him. All I think about all day is him, even when I'm with my kids or at work or out with friends. He's always on my mind. And now it will be so close to him being with me.
-2	negative	loneliness	So I'm super shy, and I have a friend who's like super outgoing and she has all these friends and I'm just here like I don't even have someone to talk to. I have tried to chat things to make friends and stuff but no matter what I do people always just stop talking to me I don't understand if I'm boring, or they think I'm weird or I just can't furfural out what I'm doing wrong :P
-3	negative	loneliness	So I plan on stopping for good now. I don't know how well this will work because I've tried it before, and it didn't work well since it only lasted not even 6 months. But I asked my friend if he would help me stop, because he's told me that I'm better than this and it's nothing but a terrible addiction, and that I won't need to do this anymore. It's put me in a better mood since last night. After school today, I plan on giving him the two pieces of metal I have with me today. I hope I can overcome it this time. :/
-3	negative	loneliness	So I read a milso post claiming she couldn't wait to take couple pictures, and it reminded me of the romantic evening I had with my soldier the day we did ours.
-10	negative	loneliness	So I started talking to a girl two weeks ago that I met on a dating site. We get along really well-it is kind of crazy. She seems so perfect. She wants to meet this weekend. She lives an hour away and she is more than willing to drive to me so I think it is safe to say that she feels something too? I'm just really worried that she won't like me when she sees me. I have real pictures of me on there, but I don't know. I have been so confident on how I look lately that I'm really surprised by how self conscience I'm being about this. I'm just so worried she won't be attracted to me for some reason and it is really stressing me out. We get along so well over the phone and I don't want to end up having wasted her time.
-5	negative	loneliness	So I talked to him earlier this morning. That he has lost interest in me. I kept asking what made him lost interest, all he reply was his sugar-coated words saying that the feeling was not right.  There goes the rejection. Life moves on.
-12	negative	loneliness	So I've been sick since the first week of January. I've had just like insane fatigue, dizziness, and headaches and then I ended up getting a fever a week later and have had one since then. So I had to go to the doctor twice and then the hospital and I missed one week of school and through out that one week I got one person who texted me and no one has cared to text me or visit me or anything. I do have a lot of friends not considerably a lot of close ones but It's just depressing that no one has cared to drop a simple text and ask if I'm ok. The one person who did text me is my bestfriend but she can't even reply either.
-17	negative	loneliness	So I've had my first fish for a month now and I finally thought I could clean his tank by myself with out my moms help. So I gathered everything and did everything right it was perfect I did all I needed. Finally I needed to put the water in so as I was putting the water in for Stanley, my beta fish, I didn't  notice that the water was way to hot. When it was all done I slowly put him in. Right when he dropped in the water he started flipping out swimming frantically through the bowl and trying to jump out. I realized to late that the water was to hot and when I put him in his little container he was already dead. I cried and begged for him to be alive but he never moved and haven't got a fish since. I feel so bad about Stanley I don't want to accidentally murder any other fish.  
-16	negative	loneliness	So i was in this long distance relationship with this girl. At first she was everything i ever wanted in a woman. Her mind was beautiful. Who she was inside was mind blowing. I never thought I'd have to search ever again. Never thought it would end the way it did. The pain she put me through made me a man. No matter how good of a person i can be to someone else doesn't mean that person would do the same for me. Inside feels dead what water of life inside me froze to say the least. I feel cold. Being positive is what i force myself to do. I wish the best to anyone that reads my post that you never have to feel the way i did. Remember you all deserve the  best and don't ever stop looking no matter how many times someone breaks you. Who knows maybe here you will find someone who knows exactly how you feel.
-1	negative	loneliness	So I wear glasses at nite. I posted some pics. Then someone made fun of me saying they were grandma glasses lol. I don't care I thought they were really cute. Anyways.that's my story
-7	negative	loneliness	So I work two jobs, my week job is great job but I make don't make a lot of money. My second job which is on the weekends as asked me to be a manager and I could possibly make more money. An possibly only have to work one job. I'm skittle scared of this transition because there's no real promises that I could make more money. I have make the decision to do the management program at my second job an  see how it goes. Scared but excited to see where this goes
-2	negative	loneliness	So Lonely right now. Feeling down again. Nothing makes sense , and don't know what to believe Another night of continuously thinking.
-9	negative	loneliness	So me and my boyfriend have been together for 2 years and 3 months and lately he's been acting weird. He is very jump and thinks I'm going to cheat constantly. I've delt with lying, other girls, drugs, drama and I'm still here and love him but I get treated like crap and the worst thing is he leaves in 14 days to Boot camp and we have done nothing but fight.
-12	negative	loneliness	So me and my boyfriend have been together for three years, and he has been at MOS school for about 2 months, one day randomly he decided that he has lost feelings for me. It was out of the blue. we ended up breaking up, I don't know if it's because he is scared or what I'm still in shock, he comes home in a few weeks so I'm hoping we can work things out. He's talking to one of his exs again an I don't see how he can when I was by his side through everything.
-2	negative	loneliness	Somebody, please message me, i just want a friend
-1	negative	loneliness	some day i hope to be free
-4	negative	loneliness	Some days it's quiet, it's dormant inside me and I might forget that it's there. Most days I feel it growing, and then when it's ready it bursts inside me and I'm unable to get out of bed, pick up the phone, make myself a meal Wishing everyone, myself included, strength today and everyday
-1	negative	loneliness	Someday, somehow I'm gonna make it all right but not right now 
-2	negative	loneliness	Some friends, my sister and I are at this sleepover. My sister has been in this weird relationship with a churchmate.  And I also feel like I am a stone cold person. There's this other friend that goes to the other girls to talk to them/catch up. She didn't come to me. I feel like I present myself as unapproachable.  Now I feel so alone. I feel like I have no one. Please help.
-2	negative	loneliness	Some one have time to chat about somethings i am having trouble with?

-2	negative	loneliness	Someone please message me !! I'm very lonely and need cheering up :'(  And I'm unfortunately sick   
-12	negative	loneliness	Someone responded to my last post, pushing the boundaries by comparing her difficult relationship to my inseparable one. Though she doesnt know how our relationship is so her comparing is beside the point. The point is that I got what she meant when she said I dont need a ring. I dont, I want one but only when hes ready to give it to me, not because I was obsessing over it.

Love to nuzzle me just as much as I love to nuzzle back. Understanding. Open minded. Fierce in love. Intense. Real in my thoughts and feelings. Gentle and kind. Sure.
-9	negative	loneliness	something weird happened: I was dreaming about my friend, and while I was dreaming of him he texted me on my phone which woke me up! freaky ! now he's sleeping and I hope he dreams about me too LOL cosmic connection
-9	negative	loneliness	sometimes i can feel and laugh and smile and act like im okay and im not dead inside. i try to tell myself that its a passing feeling, that i happy with bad moments. not bad with happy moments. i have these times where its like im watching myself talk and smile and laugh with people but its not me. i push myself into relationships trying to make myself feel. i just want to feel something. i want my heart to race. i want my eyes to really light up. i want to feel. even the bad times are numb now. i thought that all i could feel was sad but that faded. its just something constant to me that i forget about like when you get so used to wearing clothes and you cant feel them anymore like you arent wearing anything. thats where i am. i want to feel my clothes on my body. so badly.
-5	negative	loneliness	Sometimes I feel alone and I don't want to feel that way anymore. I'm slowly drifting away from my friends and I'm starting to realize that we don't have anything in common anymore; that makes me really sad. I want to be near them and I want to get along but whenever I try to voice my opinion about something they just blow it off and scold me for thinking it. They are honest with me but they're mean about it when they tell me. I want them to be people that I can be myself around.
-1	negative	loneliness	Sometimes I feel alone, and it seems like nobody cares..
-1	negative	loneliness	Sometimes I feel completely useless. Useless and used are interchangeable feelings that constantly run through my mind. I want to be good enough one day.
-3	negative	loneliness	Sometimes I feel down and the first think that's hits my head is my fianc doesn't love me anymore! however he keeps texting Nd calling me but I'm not satisfied ..
-1	negative	loneliness	Sometimes I feel like I am going though life on autopilot. I can't help but feel like I should be doing something more worthwhile but I don't know what. I find getting out of bed each day a struggle, I mean why even bother being conscious if your not doing anything significant. I don't really have any friends and my constant companion is my boyfriend of almost three years. He doesn't seem to understand that it's not his fault I am not happy or motivated there is just something wrong. Does anyone know what I mean?
-5	negative	loneliness	Sometimes i feel like i cant let out what i feel inside of me to my husband..i think its mainly because i can feel like he is not interested at it at all..i swear it is true..even if i told him just gimme 5 minutes to have a quick chit chat on whatever subject, he will  quickly say oh i have this work to finish, that, this and it just hurts my feeling..and i tried to tell him how i feel but as i said its useless..i will remember it for the next couple days and become chatty and then he will forget and be like not interested anymore. Frankly i feel like we r lack of communication.
-8	negative	loneliness	Sometimes I feel like I'm not giving you everything you want.. Sometimes I feel like you're gonna give up on me to strive for something better. I never feel good enough for you cause you're wellperfect in my eyes.. But it wouldn't for me. I would never be the same again.. You've impacted my life so much, I don't know how I'll ever return the favor.. I guess I just feel like people would like it if I weren't around, then maybe they wouldn't have to waste the time to notice me..
-2	negative	loneliness	Sometimes I feel like my walls come crashing in and no matter how much i fight them to stay up they seem to collapse and crush me anyway.  The only remedy I got now is a sweet little pill that takes it all away.
-2	negative	loneliness	Sometimes I feel like the only person who understands me is me. Sometimes I feel like the only thing that understands me is food. Sometimes I don't feel at all. I just exist. I don't even know why.Yet.
-1	negative	loneliness	Sometimes I feel like this a lot
-1	negative	loneliness	Sometimes I feel lonely, scared and worried I will be left alone without a care in the world. And I will be left vulnerable to others to misuse me
-3	negative	loneliness	Sometimes I feel lonely, yet, as soon as I realize I'm getting to close to someone I freeze up and push them away.  I don't know how to give in and let go anymore.
-1	negative	loneliness	Sometimes I get lonely and I think am I not good enough for anyone to love me am I not beautiful enough. I see people around me who have boyfriends and girlfriends and are happy do I not deserve to be happy.
-1	negative	loneliness	Sometimes I go on my roof and say to myself, do I have any friends. At school sure I hang out with them, but they don't seen to care when I'm there. They come and go. Aren't friends suppose to like hanging out with you or are you just being used?
-3	negative	loneliness	Sometimes i just wish i had anybody. Days are so rough when i just wish i had someone with me to enjoy even doing nothing I often wonder why am i single and will it be this way forever
-1	negative	loneliness	Sometimes I just wonder where I would be in 10 years.
-18	negative	loneliness	Sometimes I'm afraid I live in my own mind. That everything is just a dream. I'll wake up and this paradise I see was never real and I'm back to my taunting past. I have friends but I can't connect with then spiritually. They're there for humour. I have a special boy in my life but I'm somewhat restricted from him. I have a family but sometimes I see them as strangers. What if I'm alone. What if I live in my mind. What if there's a government taking notes on my daily life right now? Is paranoia just a term to make me think I'm experiencing anxiety so I can brush it off? You can't prove anything exists. You can't prove your hands are there just because you see them. Your eyes play optical illusions. Is this the biggest optical illusion?
-14	negative	loneliness	Sometimes i think that i am the only person different from rest of the world. Its hard but yes i m different. I speak my heart n i don't know how to manipulate people. I can see my marriage is failing but feeling handicapped that i cant walk away from it.  I feel like i die everyday when my husband kind of ignores me..i m a new mom n i want to b loved by my family which i m but dont know bout my husband..i married for love n its gone. I lament that why did i let go of my past relationships n y was not i so serious.. There were lovers who loved me deeply but i chose to ignore n walk away.. May b its bad karma but i ask god was why so much pain in my heart n tears everyday..
-1	negative	loneliness	Sometimes it's best to do so,even if it hurts. 
-3	negative	loneliness	Sometimes I want to share my life and my thoughts with friends or family members, but I don't think they really understand me. I am really sensitive and every time I try to share anything with anyone I just get criticized and I just end up feeling stupid and dumb.
-5	negative	loneliness	Sometimes I wish you wouldn't travel so much I don't care for all the expensive gifts and places. I just want you for who you are. I hope you make your flight back home to my arms. Always love you xoxo
-3	negative	loneliness	Sometimes look out my bedroom window at the caterpillars; I envy them so much. No matter what they were before, no matter what happened to them, they can just hide away and turn into these beautiful creatures that have the ability to fly away completely untouched.
-2	negative	loneliness	Sometimes love just aint enough Baby sometimes love just ain't enough.
-6	negative	loneliness	Sometimes. Sometimes I'm not. Most of the time though I'm on my own, even in crowds. You know those more-whatever moments. Frustrating. Painful. Disappointing. Boring. It all depends on who knows, and could be many things, including accepted, embraced, appreciated, and even rewarding. The learning mind works wonders. It makes true company that much more rewarding. Ahhh
-3	negative	loneliness	Sometimes when I am alone, I get sad emotions. I miss feeling special when my ex used to tell me how great I was, and I miss loving her and caring about her aswell. What do you think?
-3	negative	loneliness	Sometimes when i talk to people i always find that they don"t realy listen to me..for some reason i can"t hold a person atention when i talk to people their mind seems to wonder off and they stare into space..
-11	negative	loneliness	Sometimes you have to be strong for yourself. You have to know that youre a good person and a good friend. Whats meant to be will end up good and whats not  wont. Love is worth fighting for, but sometimes you cant be the only one fighting. At times, people need to fight for you. If they dont, you just have to move on and realize what you gave them was more than they were willing to give you. Hopefully, people realize great things when they come around and not lose something real. Always fight, until you cant anymore, and then be fought for.
-12	negative	loneliness	So my boyfriend and I are still on "break" but I really think it's pointless so this morning I told him it's either we talk and actually work on our relationship or we don't talk at all and he's still confused. He said he wants to be in a relationship but he just doesn't know if he's ready, I know I'm making him look like a bad guy but in all honesty he's not, he really like a confused child, I actually feel bad for him. We just decided we'll go a week without talking and see how we feel about eachother after that. I hope I still love and want to be with him after this week. I lose interest extremely fast.. I don't know
-6	negative	loneliness	So my close friend and I hang out every Friday after school at her house, and I'll ask her if some guy I like can come over (which she also knows him so they aren't strangers) and she'll say no or make up an excuse. But whenever I'm not there, they hang out after school. I find this really weird. Help?:/
-2	negative	loneliness	So my ex and I broke up back in October. I was quite sad about it, anyways I attend an Ivy League school, and I am pleased to say HE DOWNGRADED  Every woman's dream right? Suddenly he doesn't seem to desirable
-3	negative	loneliness	So my ex left me and our son December 1st for his ex girlfriend he also has a child with and they already got their own place together.  He hasn't even talked to me he just abandoned us  how could he do this
-7	negative	loneliness	So my ex of 2 years is now begging to have me back, missing me like crazy. Friend and family say i am better of without, i mean i am no angel in this on off relationship. I have dropped 2 dress sizes and hate being skinny. Everytime i speak with him i feel stressed. I dont know anymore.
-3	negative	loneliness	So my marine was here for 30 days I loved it ! But now he's back Cali to finish his training. I miss him like crazy but, my days go by so fast which is nice!! I just can't wait till we can skype and stuff so excited
-5	negative	loneliness	So my moms friend has always been here for me. But today she left. She isn't coming back for another 5 or 6 months. this makes me feel a bit sad. she was basically the only person that cared about me. now she's gone. and im just not at a good moment and I'm so done.
-3	negative	loneliness	Soooo bored!! I have no life! I'm not a boring person but the things people my age are into doesn't fascinate me by any means. I want adult mature conversation.
-3	negative	loneliness	Soooo tired. I work 7 days a week trying to get ends to meet and i just want a break.  at least some different people to talk to if nothing else
-4	negative	loneliness	Sophie was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia ten and a bit months ago. She died in the middle of July, having battled cancer bravely, faced chemotherapy and finally died after eleven hours in a coma, in hospital. My beautiful girl, who faced so much and gave me so many smiles and who will forever be loved. 
-5	negative	loneliness	So, so, so painful! It starts off with waves, but then becomes excruciating pangs of pain! My whole stomach hurts, my back is sore, my legs feel numb and tingly, and the pain only increases by the hour. I'm so glad this only lasts one day, and usually the first day of my period. Chocolate, please, please distract me and soothe me! Haha.
-1	negative	loneliness	.. So that friends will continue a more normal conversation with me.. and my fianc would stop worrying and frowning each time I'm feeling lost..  What to do? I just can't let the cycle spiral negatively, can I?
-1	negative	loneliness	So tired of everything! My family, my friends and my school. Is that even possible? All I do is helping them and love them for who they are. They just don't care about me at all. They will keep ignore my phone calls and I will keep waiting til they call me back. Maybe that is how it supposed be, maybe they will never change no what I do.
-7	negative	loneliness	So today I just found out I'll be attending my first military ball in March. Needless to say I'm kinda freaking out and not in a good way lol It's my boyfriends first time attending one also which I guess is a little comforting. But I have no idea what to expect or anything. Any tips/advice from anyone that's been to one?
-2	negative	loneliness	So today's my 16th birthday I WANT THIS DAY TO BE OVER!!
-4	negative	loneliness	So today while I was at work I received the best gift from my Marine ever. 2 dozen roses, my favorite food(pickles) and a beautiful diamond necklace. Even though he's 1,800 miles away, he still makes my day. &lt;3
-14	negative	loneliness	So tomorrow is the day of my operation I'm scared, nervous and confused if I even wanna do it. The other day I heard on the radio about this woman who had a scan and the doctor told her the baby died, she and her husband then went to they're local hospital to get a second opinion and the baby had a heartbeat! Now the baby is born, it's fine and healthy. I still haven't started miscarrying naturally and its been over 2 weeks now that apparently the baby had died, could it be possible that they made a mistake? I haven't seen the scan, I just couldn't make myself look. My fianc seen it tho and he said it didn't look like a 12 week baby, u didn't really have a shape so am I just giving myself falls hopes? Why doesn't my body wanna let go then? 
-5	negative	loneliness	So yesterday I had a bit of a run in with one of my best friends.  I'm just really fed up of being the one in the wrong. I know I'm not perfect and I know I'm not the best friend a person could have. But I don't think I quite deserve all the hardship I keep experiencing when it comes to friendships. I start to think that maybe my idea of living on a desert island with no one else around is actually a pretty good idea. At least then I won't be upsetting people, or being irritated by the general public! 
-11	negative	loneliness	So, Zach and I have gotten back together for a week and a half now. And I don't know if it is because he is scared that he is going away to boot camp and will have no  one there for him and he knows that I will be there, or if he really means what he said to me these past three days that we spent physically together.  I really need some advise and lots of help
-1	negative	loneliness	Spending times with my boyfriends family makes me so happy (:
-2	negative	loneliness	Spoke to Trevor for 4 hours yesterday!! He gets liberty Saturday also and Sunday this weekend! I'm sending his package today ! &lt;3
-1	negative	loneliness	Suicidesuicidesuicidesuicide That's all my head is saying!
-2	negative	loneliness	Sundays are the days I feel the most lonely  Most people who talk to me throughout the day  Don't message me or call me .. It makes me feel lonely almost like why am I here
-1	negative	loneliness	Super bored haha anyone wanna chat?
-2	negative	loneliness	Take a look at the mountains Romans 10: 9-13 if you want to be saved.
-3	negative	loneliness	talking to my friends and family doesn't help. it makes me feel like they're either judging me, or trying to take my pain away, or giving me answers that they think I wanna hear.  I feel that I'm going crazy. and I have no control of what I'm feeling.
-3	negative	loneliness	Talk to me! I'm more of a listener than a talker, I'm completely open minded. Anyone who needs to talk and just go on for a while then feel free to talk to me. I try to give advice where I can. 
-1	negative	loneliness	talk to me please. i am bored
-1	negative	loneliness	Tell me about the last interesting thought that you bottled up and never had the chance to talk about.
-1	negative	loneliness	Text Me Anytime! I'm always looking for people to text anytime so just shoot me a message 2394438938 Read full story
-3	negative	loneliness	Thank you for anyone who gave me advice , means a lot specially from ppl who are going through the same situation as you     Goodnight
-10	negative	loneliness	The 80s & 90s we're not a get decade for getting bullied in Bakersfield. I survived standard and north high bullying. But for those who say that it is something that all kids have to go through. I was am still only 4 10 and I have ADHD and bipolar so for being different did not help. But there is a difference between being laughed at and being beat. And some days that what they were beatings. I am a survivor. But my heart hurts when we loose those who can't make it to the other side. I'm all there to help
-3	negative	loneliness	The boy I love texted me that he kissed a girl for a class today. . . A class he doesn't have today. I had to drop a class that I need for my dream job because I'm not smart enough. I had a panic attack today and wish I had someone to talk to but even though I have been going to this school for a semester now and I still don't have any friends here.
-9	negative	loneliness	The day he left I felt alone and empty. I knew I wasn't going to see him again. Each night I dream that someday we'll meet again and it'll be like he never left. I just want someone to hold me and tell me they love me, and not just because we're caught up in the moment but because they mean it.
-3	negative	loneliness	The days when I feel alone. Unable to relate to anyone. The days trudge on and I wonder whether I'll ever be given a break. It's hard to cope. It's hard to keep moving forward. Especially when everything just collapses and piles upon you. The new year is looking splendid. Does anyone else feel like this?
-7	negative	loneliness	The divorce caught me by surprise.  I was working long hours to try and have a nice life for us.  She seemed happy, she had a job that was fairly stress free and paid decently.  I was tired most of the time from the grueling schedule I was working but I did so without complaint.   I'm lost now.  Don't know how to pick up the pieces.  I'll make it though.  
-4	negative	loneliness	The divorce is weeks away from being finalized. I am absolutely frightened that i will be alone. My anxiety level has hit the roof.  Im a good person.  I suffer from depression but it's under control. Why is this making me nuts?
-5	negative	loneliness	The first thing that crosses my mind when I walk out the doors of work is that I'm going home to nothing no family no friends no husband .You watch everyone hustle off rushing out happy to go home to their families or out with friends. I wish I had that.
-14	negative	loneliness	The hardest part is not being able to talk to them.. During the whole boot camp experience.. It drives you crazy not knowing. Not knowing how their feeling. Not knowing what their thinking.. Not knowing what their first letter is going to be like or what the first phone calls goin to consist of. Not knowing what ur future holds with them.. You spend the whole time not knowing.. Wondering dreaming preparing yourself for the worst and hoping for the best. Fear.. The fear of not knowing is what eats you.. Until you know Forsure it's always their creeping up on your in the back of your head. I can only pray for me and anyone else.. That everything turns out for the best.&lt;3 love. It breaks us down and makes us who we are. Experiencing what our men are in a totally different way. One they can nor we can't fully understand
-1	negative	loneliness	The highlight of my week is going to the laundromat.
-5	negative	loneliness	Their impression is my responsibility! But here's the question: all those people who walked away thinking I was the problem still annoy me to this day. Some part of me wants to explain to them that they've contributed to this end as much as I did. Is that a reasonable thing to do, or should I just move on and completely close those past chapters?
-2	negative	loneliness	The love of my life is gone for basic training for 5 months and I could lay here crying my eyes out but I rather be strong for him and me .. I want to go out and get in the best shape EVER for myself and hopefully in few months I can go with his family to pick him up from the airport and be there for him
-2	negative	loneliness	the memories of past relationships and people coming back to haunt me Causes the biggest people to cry. Nothing to do but sleep away my emotions until they travel back into my mind and heart once created to love..
-2	negative	loneliness	The more I saw you, the more I fell for you. I don't know why I make  things so complex and overthink things, but you make me forget about everything when I talk to you. You make me sad when we depart and smile when you look at me. I don't know how to describe this, but don't leave though; you're intriguing me. You're the only person I don't feel awkward with talking about anything; I feel welcomed and comforted by you. And after all this, I still refuse to say that I like you.  I'm so idiotic, indecisive, pathetic and weak; you make me feel like all the opposite.
-2	negative	loneliness	the most saddest moment when u goin to sleep n realise that u r alone n thinkin about it..
-5	negative	loneliness	The only people that I talk to everyday are my 11 year old son, who I also homeschool and my husband who is in law enforcement and works crazy shifts. My mom passed away 14 years ago and my dad moved back to his hometown in Louisiana and re-married. My brother is married with a new son and lives in Arkansas. I just don't have anyone to talk to on a consistent basis.
-1	negative	loneliness	The only person i had left me
-2	negative	loneliness	The past few days have been particularly difficult. I'm not sure why. It could be the frigid temperature, the time of year, my increasing age. I've felt like I have my hands tied behind my back and I want to run towards the sun but I can't. I'm tired and restless at the same time. I've also been single for way too long.
-10	negative	loneliness	There are only two paths you can choose. You can sit quietly and be selected out of this world, or you can adapt and change! Although this is from an anime, it is so true. I use this quote to get on with my everyday life by meeting people and avoid being lonely. Also keeps me hyped enough for school until i apply for police academy or the military. Im subjected to talking to anyone if you are in need to expressing your emotions. Best of Luck to you all!
-4	negative	loneliness	There are times like right now that I think I'm slipping into insanity because I'm missing him sooooo much.
-13	negative	loneliness	There is more that I left behind than I thought. There is more I have lost than I have gained. No matter how hard I try to replicate my life, there is always something missing. I know now that the sinking feeling is that of my soul. It isn't the house or the car or the bike. It's the people who kept me afloat. I tried looking for it in people here, some threw me a 'life jacket', some ignored. I so wish I could replicate my life - I so wish I find someone with whom I can be me.
-7	negative	loneliness	There is this moment right before dawn, you can see the gentle glow of sun start to fill the sky. It's that pink haze that promises morning is coming, a new day will begin. In those fleeting moments there's hope, there's an expectation that the light will chase away the darkness. 
-22	negative	loneliness	There once was a time where I got a message from this really cute guy. We spoke for a few days. He disappeared for a few days. I was confused for a few days. Lol.  Then he messaged me again and I decided to give him my number. I remember him always asking to take me out, but I never gave him the chance. Something terrible happened to me and I really needed someone there because I had no one. No family or friends because I moved to a different state. That same day, he texted me again and I finally agreed to go on a date with him.  I'm missing him a lot right now and writing about him is a way I cope with it. Those kind of moments like I wrote about are the reasons why I toughen up and stick it out for him and I. And godddddddamn he is so handsome. He is mine and all mine. I get to look into those eyes for the rest of my life. I'm not letting go of him. Ever.
-1	negative	loneliness	There's a man in my bed. Eeeeeeek! Yay me!
-16	negative	loneliness	there's this guy I was kinda sorta talking to and the reason i say kinda sorta is because he lives 22 hours away from me. he doesn't like the distance so we can't be together basically and we both agreed we'd rather meet in person and go from there. but the thing is, now whenever we talk to each other he asks me to send him inappropriate pictures and he just makes me uncomfortable when I say no because he keeps asking over and over again. and we haven't talked to each other in over two weeks and yesterday he texted me saying "i still like you kinda ish" . im just so confused as to wether I should let him go for good.
-8	negative	loneliness	The second i close my computer real life hits me Im alone. For the past -at least- six years all i do at nights is just sitting in my bed and talking to myself. I have no friends and i never had a boyfriend. Is it because im ugly? Because im weird? Im trying everything i can.. I make my hair, put on make up, try to act as normal as i can but nothing work. Even if someone ever likes me all i do is pushing them away.  I like being alone, watching movies all day and never have to worry about someoneelse but the truth is i need someone. I dont wanna die alone.. 
-1	negative	loneliness	These days, I feel really sad, but the thing is that, I CANT CRY , I tried , i just can't. It's a horrible feeling because you always feel bad and sad without knowing why and you cant release all this pain wih the tears.
-1	negative	loneliness	The sky passes by as the rain falls down and streams against by bedroom window almost like a waterfall as I lie staring at the ceiling  in my messy room thinking about all the things that could've been or may happen but still I'm all alone with no one to speak to no one to relate to no one who understands the pain I battle every single day I wake up the pain I feel when I go to sleep even my dreams are lonely.loneliness like being blind and deaf and only knowing that your body is moving.
-1	negative	loneliness	The thing about pretending you're okay is that if you become good enough at pretending even you start to believe it for a few seconds every once in a while. When everything goes wrong and you feel broken on a daily basis, those few seconds mean so much more
-1	negative	loneliness	The world feels so empty without my girl.
-12	negative	loneliness	They always say, when one door closes another door opens But what if you dont want to try the next door. What if you have tried so many doors in the past you dont want to try another in fear. Or that the doors that you do open, only lead you to misery and pain. I want out of this house of doors. But to leave this house of doors, I have to open one last door. What happens if I cant even do that?  I have friends around me, my family and even a boyfriend but even in a full room i always feel alone. I just want to be myself again. 
-5	negative	loneliness	Things have gotten so insane (in large part because of me) that I'm not even sure who the bad guy is anymore. I don't know if my family is mean and controlling like I feel they are- or if I'm just a cruel mentally unstable daughter and sister. The holidays are coming up, and I might be moving away- I need help sorting through this -___- help!
-2	negative	loneliness	Thinking of my cousin right now. I miss him so much. Why did he have to go? He was the best. :'(  I'll never forget our last memories. I wish there was a cure for cancer my boy. I miss you. Knowing you're in heaven isn't taking the hurt away like it used to. I just miss you so much cuz.
-10	negative	loneliness	This guy I kinda like gave me a hint that he wanted to hang out But I asked my parents and they started freaking out cause he is a boy like idek if anything would go on cause honestly I think of him like a brother. But it's so embarrassing cause they are saying he has to come to my house to meet him and Ik he will think it's weird or not hang out with me bc of it and Ik my parents love me and everything but ugh
-1	negative	loneliness	This happened today.  1-9-14 Slap a smile on my face and no one will know. I'm not depressed or anything. I just miss my grandma.
-5	negative	loneliness	This hurts me bc I have a cousin who is only 10 years old and is disabled/ autistic(I'm sorry if they're not the same idk) but I would really help them and keep them happy.
-1	negative	loneliness	This is for guys only  I'm so lost ):
-8	negative	loneliness	This is no longer a concern of mine.  When you find someone who you love, respect, and are devoted to - the fear of being alone vanishes.  The fear of losing her is there for me, but she's a good woman with a loving heart.  I'm always concerned with losing those I love more because of a health issue or accident due to past experiences I've had.  Will I end up alone in the future?  I don't believe so - not now.  :-)
-1	negative	loneliness	This is one of those random things I decided to post on a whim 
-3	negative	loneliness	This is really terrible but my family hasn't really taken my puppy out for walks or agility training (she is a border collie, german shepherd mix) and now it's come to our attention that we were bad. We need help. We want to train her properly but we sometimes don't have time. I don't have the heart to let her go. But I'm willing to spend time and train her. Someone give me advice? She's 9 months. 
-2	negative	loneliness	This is such a stupid fear because why does it matter if someone doest like you, you can't be liked by everyone, but it had stopped me from getting to know so many people who I wanted to get to know its ridiculous.  
-8	negative	loneliness	This is supposed to be the time in life, when we take the time for us, to enjoy life. The kids are older now, they don't need us as much as they used to. The time to travel, go places and do thing together, that we never had time for before. Instead, 23 years of marriage, destroyed by an unfaithful wife. It's been almost 2 years now, since the separation and the divorce and I find myself alone. Living in the "family home" that is filled with ghosts of happy memories. Dusty photographs of a once happy and united family, that stood strong against the overwhelming tide of broken families.
-7	negative	loneliness	This is the first time these words have ever slipped past my lies, and this is the most truthful thing about me:  Please, if you have any tips that have worked for you in breaking the cycle, share them. I'm going to start by telling small truths in instances where I wouldn't normally. I hope that I can use those moments as building blocks to propel me into honesty in all areas.
-9	negative	loneliness	This may be a spout but maybe it will make my sentiment more crystal. I am young (we have established this) but I find it to be unfair that girls who exploit themself, without rememberance of self respect, get more attention. They get more attention than let's say..a suitable woman who has been single for years! I feel for these women.. feel for myself in a sense, too. I may become just another lonely lady without love. Because of my (suspecting) diverge personality or, in my mind, my parents ruined it for me. Which one? You decide.  I am lonesome and I need his existence. His uncovered body on mine and our aromas blending into one divine whole.
-1	negative	loneliness	This may sound stupid but can our guys still be deployed if they aren't active?
-3	negative	loneliness	This means nothing.yers can range in height from 6'1 to 7'2, but greatness lies in passion.
-9	negative	loneliness	This morning when Kenny dropped me off at school he said, "I'll always love you. Even when I'm gone away at boot camp. I'll think of you every second of every day." Hear him say these words made me burst into tears. He is the most important person in my life and I'm going to miss him so much. 
-16	negative	loneliness	This seems to be true. I know the saying you have to go through the bad ones to learn and appreciate the good ones.  I realized something with myself recently. I attract the wrong women, I'm not good enough for the type that I want. I don't drink alcohol, smoke or do any drugs. I'm not a wild party person and I'm far from being considered handsome. I seem to only to find those that want that in a mate. That or they've been hurt so badly they have unreachable standards for me. Even ones who have crushes on me admit they would probably cheat on me or leave me. This from women who like me! With my past relationships and these unsuitable women that come to me I have raised the white flag. I give up I'm not good enough I get it. Sorry I even tried. 
-5	negative	loneliness	This weekend I got into an argument on a gaming forum. Simply put, I disagreed with what they said and made it clear. I guess (s)he didn't like what I said because they immediately became defensive and called me a bully as a result. This put me into an awkward position not only because I have an anti-bully website but I also sincerely wanted to make fun of this person. People are so quick to state that it's their opinion; assuming that it's infallible. Of course I didn't make fun of them and rerouted that energy into an article. As usual check out my website for the complete article: we.arepeople2.com/for-the-record-opinions-and-bullying/
-4	negative	loneliness	This will be fairly long, however I really really hope someone in this world can read the whole thing. Anyway, that's my story, and I hope to god someone could take the time to read it all.
-1	negative	loneliness	This year I promised myself to have more fun think bout myself more, stop cancelling invites from friends/ making excuses, look after my body i.e exercise etc and basically start enjoying life more. This is achievable as I have more funds than previous years and I hate feeling so low down. Making it happen IJN anything is possible 
-12	negative	loneliness	Three days ago I had two best friends. a boy and a girl. I loved them both more than I can say. The girl knew that no matter how I tried I was in unrequited love with the boy. Three days ago I found out that they had been seeing each other secretly. I confronted the boy and he got mad and ended our friendship. The girl says she is fine but is distant towards me. Now I have no one. 
-2	negative	loneliness	Times like now i wish i had wasn't lonely.
-4	negative	loneliness	Tired of being constantly lied to, cheated on and heart broken over and over again , my one wish is to meet someone who understands and love me for being who I am, a jealous possessive lover with a big warm heart
-3	negative	loneliness	To be completely honest, i don't know why i feel so lonely, i'm popular, i fit well in with crowds, i am never alone always with someone, but i still feel so lonely. I been wondering for a while why, this was happening but i just can't think of anything, i don't know if i'm missing someone, or if i'm in love or what it is, i don't really know what love feels like, i', pretty much of an airhead, can anybody tell me why i feel so lonely?
-19	negative	loneliness	Today, I feel the most unlucky that I have ever felt. I posted a story in this group just a little over a month ago probably. Well, unfortunately I'm posting another one, which means that another dog died. My best friend. It sounds mean to say, but between the two Shelties that my Mother brought home in 2006, I had a favourite. Well, today that favourite died. My Father called me today to tell me that my little brown Sheltie, Shep, fell down the stairs and broke his back. My Dad couldn't pay the vet bills to get him fixed up, and even if he could it might not have worked, so I guess he thought the best thing to do for the dog would be to have him put down. I am heartbroken. That dog was my pride and joy. He followed me everywhere and he was always so happy and peppy. He could be so very annoying sometimes, but he was mine. I could still love him unconditionally. I am going to miss his joyfulness. 
-8	negative	loneliness	Today i found out my baby doesnt have a heart beat, i'm supposed to be nearly 8 weeks pregnant. i was in a car accident last week and broke my nose but the adrenaline and fear was too much for my body, causing my thyroid and heart rate to fly out of control. My own body killed my baby. and my body will continue to kill my babies untill my thyroid is removed.  my soul is crushed and i dont know how to continue with my life
-12	negative	loneliness	Today In 5th hour I got made fun of by popular guys for not having the iOS 7 ,and they called me names.then in 6th hour a guy was talking to my attractive friend and told her its a pretty flower she drew,she said I drew it(I did) and he said he's surprised that an ugly person can draw that beautiful.im just done with talking to guys.
-3	negative	loneliness	Today is a very depressing and lonely day. Usually I can hold myself together and keep the tears back, but not today. I've seriously been crying all day, even at school. I can't wait until my Marine comes home.. I just hope I don't have to wait until the week we get married, I need him.. 
-1	negative	loneliness	Today is  Love u guys!&lt;3
-2	negative	loneliness	Today is the last day I hold my breath. But I'm quite sure he's forgotten.
-13	negative	loneliness	Today I've had engouhin November 2013 I took 3 sleeping pillsit was the first time in my I have ever done something like that. I ended up in hospital, out of ittoday I've done the same but only took 2so the high was alrightI was taking a bath and I started to see things moving and stuffit was funlike a kid being entertainedwhen I got out I saw on my chair in the living room and apparentl kept drifhting on and off. All of a sudden it was 8pm. To be honest ,it felt good to be out of it for awhile. Unfortunately I don't have the real guts yet it takes to reall go all the way but for now, it's good as it is.
-3	negative	loneliness	Today I will address "make"I don't like to hear others speak of "making" someone else do or be this or that. It has very bossy sound that is very off putting. Let us try the word "inspire" shall we. 
-1	negative	loneliness	Today I woke again into this life 
-3	negative	loneliness	Today marks a year of being single, without anyone to hold, care or love me till we part. I just want someone
-10	negative	loneliness	today was a crappy day for me. i had went up to the college thing and they made me feel worthless. not to mention that i had crappy scores on my test like 12 23 and 37. the high classes were 30 some thing to 100. i had to lie to my mom and my sisters to say that i had honors wen i didnt even make it that high. but i think that i am going to take honors not caring what the man said. now my mom think i am smart when i am not and i feel so down that i need someone to talk to. 
-5	negative	loneliness	Today was my birthday. I spent it alone of course. My friends didn't text or call. Of course I don't have a boyfriend. My family thinks I'm crazy. But I'm in a world of pain. I barely leave my house. I had to move home a few years ago to help my mother. Still here. I really want to end it all. Tonight if I could. The funny this is I don't have a knife sharp enough, a gun, or any money to buy enough drugs to kill myself with. I don't know why everyone thinks suicide is such a bad thing. When people are on life support you can pull the plug and it's ok. Being this depressed and lonely makes me think I'm dead inside already. So what's the difference. Why can't I end my suffering. This is not just a bad day. I have always been miserable even as a child. Nothing so terrible has caused me to feel this way, I was born broken. My whole family wants to see me get my masters degree. I'll graduate in May and give them that memory but I'm sure I will not see 27.
-4	negative	loneliness	To me, being alone with my thoughts give me the opportunity to reflect and think back whatever that had happened recently or on that day. It makes me understand various things that I don't at that moment of time and gradually improve entirely as a person. I guess, it's almost a habit of mine, to think through everything and make a conclusion out of them.
-15	negative	loneliness	Tomorrow my boyfriend leaves for Texas to start his basic training. I have such mixed emotions about this whole journey coming up and every time I tell myself I am strong and I can get through this with him, I get this overwhelming feeling of loneliness and sadness. I have no idea what to expect, and honestly, being limited to just letters for a few months scares the heck out of me. It amazes me how positive and certain he is about how we can do this and get through the next 2 and a half years while I'm finishing university and he with his training. I came on this site because I realize I need and really want support from others who are in the same position as I am. All I know is it is not going to be easy.   
-3	negative	loneliness	Tonight was hard for me. I broke down and cried all alone looking at his picture. They shut down a base in afghan so now he's pretty sure he won't be home till December . Tonight was just rough
-2	negative	loneliness	"Too young to understand" is the ultimate insult to me. Looks can be deceiving. Young body, mature mind. I'd prefer to be treated right rather than tore down because of a meaningless number.
-2	negative	loneliness	To prove my point when someone's really just harassing me with the tailgating, sometimes I just brake. *snickers*
-5	negative	loneliness	To the ones with broken dreams, and to the lost and hopeless. I was a lonely depressed kid about to commit suicide and Jesus saved my life, he gave me worth and told me I have meaning and their is a purpose for my life. I hope you find the life that I found. Jesus is great and he will fix your broken heart.
-6	negative	loneliness	Two days now I guess it's like giving up smoking, the first few days are the hardest.    Hopefully tomo will be better, maybe if I sleep it won't hurt so much I won't be seeing the reacurring visions that torment my mind and that are destroying my heart. I can only hope! X
-10	negative	loneliness	Ugh. A month before my soldier left his grandmother who he is very close to passed away. Last night his grandad did too  I just felt so horrible!!! But my man is one of those guys who likes to move on as soon as possible. He knew his granddad was sick anyways. I think he just try's to block it out because he can't let it get to him. He really didn't seemed bummed out about it last night but he said he really missed me. It just amazes me how strong he is!! Only a week left and his boots hit afghan ground! Nervous !
-1	negative	loneliness	Ugh I like to bottle up all my secrets and emotions:/ I know it's not good at all
-4	negative	loneliness	Unless it's someone I really have to deal with on a regular basis, I'm not going to force myself to get along with anyone. You only have to hurt me once on purpose, then I'm pretty much done with you.
-4	negative	loneliness	Vacancy on the right side of my bed - I am 26 and have had many short term relationships in my adult life. I think maybe I'm not attracting the right kind of men, I am confident and have a wicked sense of humour BUT I'm carrying a little extra weight Is this holding me back?
-7	negative	loneliness	Very confused about how my husband is treating me. He was away on a business trip this week and got back today. I just got home from a long day and thought he would be a little happier to see me. He's been texting me all day telling me how much he misses me only to throw a tooooo small t-shirt at me saying I would look good in it and continues working on his laptop. What?!
-3	negative	loneliness	Very happy that my school has a great special education program and the kids are really not made fun of at all. It's considered a "loser" thing to do if you make fun of or mock a child with severe autism or Down syndrome in my school. One of the few winning qualities about the people I'm with every day.
-1	negative	loneliness	Wallowing in self-pity. How do you make urself work out when you feel depress because of certain dissapointment?
-7	negative	loneliness	Wanting to have a relationship but knowing it's a bad idea. I'm at a place right now where I am trying to heal. I do not want a 'White Knight' to save me. If I ever get into a relationship it would have to be because I trust that person a lot and they have accepted me for me. I was asked out recently but I said no. I feel bad about it but I just didn't like him the same way he liked me. I'm just not ready for a relationship but at the same time I feel very, very lonely.
-1	negative	loneliness	Want Someone who is a good conversation and is 13 - 14
-1	negative	loneliness	Want to be my friend  I am a new user to EP
-1	negative	loneliness	Want to talk to someone whose cute.. I am cute so i should have a cute company too 
-4	negative	loneliness	Weight Loss. Weighed in yesterday at 484 so now I am down 28 pounds from previous weigh ins of 486, 495, and my biggest 512. I have felt discouraged a few times though I am still commited to weight loss and feeling better.  I hope everyone is doing well in the new year.
-1	negative	loneliness	We little knew that morning 
-3	negative	loneliness	Well, awhile ago I wrote a story in this group. I love you all &lt;3
-4	negative	loneliness	Well for a while now iv been searching for a female best friend that's open minded and accepting that I can talk to day and night about anything..who want catch feelings I'm just like for a nice friend
-3	negative	loneliness	Well guys this is the last post before I officially see my MARINE&lt;3 I leave for California early tomorrow morning! I am SO nervous & beyond excited!!&lt;333 87 days later! Hahah (: Anyway I'm staying at Caleb's house tonight so I can leave for the airport early in the morning with his parents. I see him in 2 days, on family day! It's all I've been thinking about the past 10 days..& 87 days AHHHH like this all seems sooo unreal!! Stay Strong Marine Girls. Remember it's ONLY temporary&lt;3
-8	negative	loneliness	well he left 4 days ago, i was doing okay until today, i think it finally hit me..im not sure how im gonna make it without him. Hes the rock when im weak and right now im weak and alone  my family isnt being supportive and my friends have disappeared..car troubles didnt help today..thanks for letting me vent!
-8	negative	loneliness	Well here goes. I lost my little girl Cassie at 3 werks due to bacterial meningitis. she was born 26 nov of 1996 and passed 17 dec 1996. I was so amazed at the love I felt for her the moment she arrived, it was overwhelming. i loved her more than my own life and i begged god to take me instead. there is not a day that goes by still that i do not miss her, love her or mourn her. it has left a hole in me so deep it will never be filled. i would not wish this on my worst enemy. i never had anymore children since the fear of loss is so great. i love you Cassandra Laine and Mommy will never forget you.
-14	negative	loneliness	Well here I go. So a few months back I got my gf of 2 years pregnant. She never told me and got an abortion with out ever telling me a single thing. When she finally told me of course I was very up set. So I told her I needed a break. And that I didint want to break up I just needed some time. I took a break for a week. During this time I realized that I truly did love her and that I wanted to spend the rest of my life with her. So fast forward to months to when I find out during that week she sent naked pictures to a bunch of dudes to apparently get back at me for needing time.
-3	negative	loneliness	Well, how do I start, I have been struggling with depression for quite some time now, and I'm also currently going to a therapist, which is not really working that well for me as of now I feel like I have no friends at all, I mean, I do, but most of them already got married or are in a serious relationship. I am currently in what is supposed to be a relationship as well, sort of, I have been seeing this girl for some time, about 4 months, but I'm always feeling like she deserves better than me, so I end up cancelling our plans and staying home by myself while she goes out, It's so weird how I want to see her and not be lonely but at the same time I do not want to, and here I am, home on a Sunday night, just like I was yesterday, feeling lonely, not knowing what to do, crying for no reason, I just want the day to end already.
-3	negative	loneliness	Well I am 17 years old got intimate with this amazingly awesome guy that I have known forever we didn't use protection and I'm not on birth control and he didn't pull out they say that some women can detect when they are pregnant right away and that's how I feel I am wondering could I be pregnant
-3	negative	loneliness	We'll I created this profile cause I have deprassion and sometimes I let out my depress thoughts through speaking and it have a sad depressing life so please no hair mail
-3	negative	loneliness	Well I don't NEED someone, but I want to. If you want to, message me. We can have a nice chat about anything good. ;P
-3	negative	loneliness	Well I got to talk to him tonight. And I've never been so excited to see my phone ring. But then he dropped the bomb on me. Apparently he might get deployed, he's not sure yet. As soon as he told me I started bawling. I couldn't help it, I knew I shouldn't have let him hear that but I couldn't make it stop. I am barely holding myself together while he is at AIT, I know I couldn't handle him being deployed. I'm so scared and confused. I feel like a terrible person for praying that he won't go since I know that it means someone else will, but I can't help it.
-3	negative	loneliness	Well, I have a weird feeling like I'm going to die soon. It may seem strange but I'm ok with it. I feel peaceful just knowing. Any one know what this means?
-4	negative	loneliness	Well, I like this guy at my school. He sits behind my friend who sits to the right of me, and we talk a little bit.;
-3	negative	loneliness	Well, I'm currently sitting eating lunch by myselfas always.  I want to have friends but I'm afraid of being rejected and losing people. I want to just let go and start again. If I could start my life over I would change everything!
-9	negative	loneliness	Well im new to this so here goes.. we keep in contact with each other via anyyyyyy way we can like Skype our facebook oovoo voxer  you name it any app we have it lol he is currently stationed in japan for two years and we plan to meet as soon as he can get leave but im just wondering if anyone else out there is in the same situation as me id love to hear from you's! anything to keep me positive and busy 
-2	negative	loneliness	Well, in the last hour or so I've gone from a little upset and a sad smiley to heartbreak, depression and I cried a little. Why am I so pathetic?!
-9	negative	loneliness	Well I really don't know where to start. I'm fat. I weigh about 180 pounds and and I'm 16. I really feel like I'm fat, like my stomach sits in my laps and I have thunder thighs. My friend/a guy I like says I have a fat chin :/ he says my face is very muscular but he doesn't know that it does hurt my feelings because I just laugh at him. I'm trying to go on a diet but I just can never stick to one. I really hate myself. Like no cute guys ever talk to me. I really hate myself. Ik I can lose weight but I will have this face forever. I feel as if I have a big nose so I'm getting surgery for it when I get older and thanks to my friend I will see if chin surgery is available. I used to cut but I stopped October 9, 2013  my mom doesn't know I'm depressed. I fake a smile every day. I'm not here for pity, I just wanted to get this off my chest 
-1	negative	loneliness	Well ladies, after much consideration and discussion, my marine and I have decided to tie the knot! :D  I can't wait!
-14	negative	loneliness	Well loneliness.. I am lonely and i feel lonely quite often.. But I like it, I love it! Do you know why? Maybe because it gives me time to be honest with my own self.. You can't be yourself within society, you cover yourself with shield and fight for your goal.. It can be anything: make friends, give a good expression about yourself, show yourself as a good person, cover your flaws, don't do anything that goes against the rule of society and many many others.. But you are only true yourself when you are alone drowning in your own thoughts with no goal with no one around That's why I always say I love to be myself. It's just because i love the time being spent with my own self without any distraction in thoughts. And Experience Project is the notepad for my thoughts that flows in when I am alone and true to myself..
-4	negative	loneliness	Well Might hate this feeling of being lonely and having not many friends to talk with. I'm a person of many layers to my personality once your start getting to know me you will enjoy the knowledge you have of me. I love books because it brings me to a knew world. Though I find myself being left out of things from my so called friends sadly. Ugh
-6	negative	loneliness	Well my.brother is locked up. He is all I have even though he does drugs and alcohol and he is a gangbanger I still need him. My dad is alcoholic so he is no help I dont like talkin to him cause everything is just am argument 
-3	negative	loneliness	WellMy heart goes out to the strong women that stand behind our military men (and vice versa). My soldier is my sunshine, he keeps me, well.. ME! I am being strong for him. He'll be back soon.  -soontobearmybride : )
-1	negative	loneliness	-_- well. Nobody really talks to me anymore
-4	negative	loneliness	Well seems like alot of people on here are lonely that's why we are all on here.  Lol find new friends etc.  
-4	negative	loneliness	Well, thank God I've never witnessed this first hand, but I have seen results. Take a look at some of our homeless, and you'll see what I mean.
-6	negative	loneliness	Well the women are waiting for me to come out to the garden,so I'm off and running, I call these woman, The woman in waiting. They been there for me right after my son passed, telling me to plant a memorial garden something in memory of my son.Now just for him but a garden for every one who lost a love one, they will have a spot to plant a flower, and they will help take care of, let your sons memorial garden be the first to open this memorial spot for us all.So i'm going out to work on it, put down some more flowers, the stones and set a white fence around the spot to pretect the area from the maintance men so when they cut the grass it won't destroy the flowers. I have a lot of work to do on the site but I'll love every minuted of it, Its something I can do , to keep his memories a live.                      page124
-1	negative	loneliness	Well yeah Why else would I join this app? Cause I'm lonely.                               :l
-9	negative	loneliness	well yea i think most people are at my age 23. i especially get afraid due to the fact im a college student and i really cant have kids till i have my life in order. college then career then possibly kids if i can even carry. my boyfriend and i havent been using condoms and ive been on the pill. it still makes me worried so i always have pregnancy tests on hand just in case. 
-4	negative	loneliness	Well yet another 6 months that my boyfriend with be deployed. It has gotten allot more easier to cope with him being gone yet hurts not having him here. But seeing pictures from places makes me feel much better knowing he's doing alright. 
-11	negative	loneliness	We made it through bootcamp he and I.  He is now in CT at A school. We have been together for 4 years, in March and have had  many challenges that have tested our love. Being in the navy has become our life's  biggest commitment. I am so proud to be his girlfriend and admire him for his sacrifice.  But I can't accurately describe in words my loneliness at his absence. I beg for strength every day.  And I feel silly when I cry over the smallest things that remind me that he's not here with me. I appreciate more than I can say the people on this site. Because when I need the strength and support I come here. Bless all of us who are keeping up and keeping on. 
-1	negative	loneliness	We need to not make each other feel bad about themselves and try to care for each other.  In the end when you put someone down it takes away apiece of both of your hearts
-8	negative	loneliness	Went to the doctor on Friday.Diagnosed as bipolar and put on medication.Arrived home and told my girlfriend.She just said I can't do this anymore.I'm crushed.Went to bed and just stared at the wall.Told my kids about my bipolar and they didn't know what to say.I stayed there until Monday morning.I've had 5 hours sleep in 3 days.I've eaten 1 sandwich.No one even said hello.I thought getting treatment would help.Wish I'd kept my mouth shut.Life is worse than ever now
-4	negative	loneliness	We put up walls to save ourselves from the hurt that is coming to us. We lock our hearts away so far so nobody can reach it. So it wont be destroyed like it has been before. The walls are our safe haven. All the people that have hurt us like never before have added to this wall. They add more protective layers adding to the complication of ever getting it down again
-3	negative	loneliness	We received dates & I must say the countdown is looking FABULOUS!! I am beyond ecstatic to see my handsome soldier! I wish I could fast forward time lol 
-1	negative	loneliness	"We're just fumbling through the grey Mat kearny
-7	negative	loneliness	WE SKYPED! I always read how happy a text or how Skype makes the day better. and wow I am so happy and just seeing him I know we will be okay. I mean we weren't bad or anything but I was worried. I am so extremely happy. I know tomorrow will be a better day than today now. One day at a time right? they will add up eventually!
-9	negative	loneliness	We texted up until about 4 today and then he just stopped. I guess he made it to boot camp already. I just hope he writes. We've talked and texted every day for the past 2 years. And now my phone lays silent. How do you cope those first few days?
-13	negative	loneliness	We were so young my beloved.   I stood beside you and vowed never to leave you.   You vowed the same thing.  But one day you turned away and left me.   Do you remember that night?   That night I begged you to stay?   To keep your promise? But you said you no longer loved me.   I laid my soul bare,  clutched at your leg literally on my knees.  All pride shed.   You pulled me off you and walked out.   I picked up my pride and never begged you again.   And that's how we will remain.  And next time we talk I will laugh with you and pretend I don't sometimes still think you hung the moon and stars.  
-3	negative	loneliness	What annoys me the most is when someone squeezes the toothpaste tube like it been in a fight or leaves it open/uncovered. 
-10	negative	loneliness	What a sweet surprise! This morning as I was laying in bed trying to catch more zzz, someone was at my door. Finally, after the second door bell, I grumpily got up to see who was bothering me. By the time I got to my door however, whoever was there had already left. Instead, there was a box that had "1-800-flowers" on it.  How sweet is he? All the way in NC and he still managed to send me some flowers. =] 
-8	negative	loneliness	What determines success? Is it intelligence? Is it popularity? No, its not. Like it or not, a disabled person is just as capable as you. If you believe you can, you probably can. There's nothing holding them back, and you certainly shouldn't try.  I would also like to point out that there is no physical or mental disability that can hold someone back from having a decent life. However, those who would put others down so they can raise themselves back up, are destined to be failures they're entire lives. 
-2	negative	loneliness	What holds me back from interacting with others ina way that opens me up completely? That makes me vulnerable? Rejection. That even if I do try to get to know others and allow them to get to know me, that they would reject me.  So that's my miserable story
-1	negative	loneliness	What is everyone doing tonight?
-1	negative	loneliness	What's the point of life? Was the writer of Ecclesiastes right?  Is life really "vanity & vexation of spirit?"
-3	negative	loneliness	When alone or need someone to talk to. Does it seem like the equivalent of neck deep in water and thirsty
-3	negative	loneliness	When I am on ep I enjoy talking to anyone and its good to talk , it helps to open up and let the stress out
-5	negative	loneliness	When I leave my house or visit family I pretend I'm okay. Most days I feels like my mind is being held together with strings and duck tape that are slowly unraveling. I need to get myself help soon before I have a nervous breakdown. My downfall is that I'm a good actress therefor most people in my life have no idea how much I'm struggling:-(
-1	negative	loneliness	when i never got any response nor explanation. so we are done 
-2	negative	loneliness	When I think about my dead boyfriend I'm overwhelmed with this Erie feeling. Here today gone the next. I feel hollowed out. I would give up every friend I have to have him back. He was my person, he cared about me and only me. He was just ripped away from me and Im alone. I have so many emotions I feel so unstable all the time. I hate the pitty. I have this constant feeling of impending doom. I long for him. How is he really gone?? 23 year olds don't just die I just want to talk to him
-2	negative	loneliness	When I truly care for someoneheir mistakes but the heart still cares
-3	negative	loneliness	When I was 2, my parents split up and my mom and I moved to the US from England.  Sometimes I write him letters, but I don't send them because I know he won't answer. Children weren't meant to grow up without a parent. It affects them in a way that you can't fix later on in their lives.
-5	negative	loneliness	When I was in middle school I tried out for the baseball team. In my opinion I did horrible during tryouts,  but I guess the coaches thought I was ok. I didn't go to tryouts the next day and just decided to quit. The next day they had the results posted on who made the team and there was my name on the list. They crossed it out because I didn't go to second day of tryouts. I was afraid of not making the team that I just quit. I would've made the team if I wouldn't have let that get to me.
-10	negative	loneliness	When I was younger, during my elementary and middle school years, I was the good kid. People always commented on my assiduous altruism. They called me humble and well-behaved. My mom and family exalted me for a time. I reasoned that if I wanted all this attention, I had to continue to be good. I did not do things out of the innocence of the act, but because I loved the praise. I was selfish. It sustained my immature insecurities. This is my new path. This is my new dawn. After all, I am the Son of the Morning Star.
-4	negative	loneliness	When I was younger I was overweight. Just a little. My entire family is a little on the heavy side. That was in February and ever since then I have been struggling with eating. My friends opinions are important to me. They never intended for me to hear that, but I did. I didn't get them in trouble because I was embarrassed. I've lost ten pounds. I'm currently 12, 113 lbs, and 5'2". Maybe 5'3". Whenever I'm hungry it makes me feel happy and in control. I don't like eating because I feel like a pig no matter how little I eat. I absolutely HATE eating in public. It makes me scared when I'm not hungry. 
-4	negative	loneliness	When people ask what it's like to be lonely, I can really only describe it as missing someone you've never met and a place you've never been.
-2	negative	loneliness	When people say "This comes from the heart" does it really? Or does it just come from your conscious
-4	negative	loneliness	When she/he: selfish..this is the most annoying attitude. BUT, for me, everyone have this personality. Even I am. Please get rid of this habit. Cause life is beautiful when we can serve people sincerely without asking back.
-13	negative	loneliness	When someone has been rejected so many times it can take a toll on you mentallyif you reject me, it does not affect me because someone else will care for me,  however if you suffer with years of rejections you have too figure out a way too leave the negative.  If you decide too ask a woman or man out and they say nolearn too move on.    If he or she TRULY wants you.you will not be rejected.   It is amazing how rejection can really control someones lifewith me you won't be rejected because there will be better communication, i will know what you want from me, you will know what i want from you (which is not very much).    If i say something too youyou will be secure enough too know i am not rejecting you i simply do not agree with what you are saying sometimes.     With me you will know the difference between rejection and simply not agreeing.     I know how too make you secure.
-7	negative	loneliness	When you are in a relationship the person that you are with should bring out nothing but the best in you right? While she does bring out the best in me she brings out the worst in me too. I can't help but feeling like i might be happier with someone else but at this point i have no idea how i could possibly tell her that. I feel stuck in this relationship which is perfectly fine when she is bringing out the best in me its the happiest i ever am but when she brings out the worst in me its cataclysmic. I don't know how to figure all of this out and i REALLY have no clue who to talk to about any of this. I just want to be happy.
-1	negative	loneliness	When you need someone the most and you're falling apart and their not there and you have no one to talk too..
-3	negative	loneliness	When you're different, sometimes you don't see the millions of people who accept you for what you are. All you notice is the person who doesn't. Jodi Picoult
-9	negative	loneliness	When your mom tries to kill herself every year it takes 'I brought you into this world, I can take you out' to a whole new level :-/ She was a female version of Jekyll and Hyde.  She would go from spanning the 3 year old with a 2x4 to giving us too much sweets the next day.  We tried to enjoy the good times but really we lived in fear and walked on egg shells.  I often played shape goat to keep younger sisters safe.
-9	negative	loneliness	When you think you're the loneliest person out there, there's someone just as lonely. It hurts just as bad sometimes. So if you're ever feeling lonely, know that someone feels your pain. They know what it's like to wake up everyday, wondering why they're even here. To question whether or not they will be safe, and if anyone loves them. That person is me.
-2	negative	loneliness	Where did all my happiness go?? Its like the darkness was creeping up slowly and just consumed me and now im trapped.
-1	negative	loneliness	While writing my bf a letter  I started to cry  I'm feeling so depressed right now 
-1	negative	loneliness	Who has a soldier doing basic training in Ft Sill O.K.?
-9	negative	loneliness	Who here had to quit some friendships? I did. The guy that was my 'best friend' had some serious narcissistic charactaristics. He would only talk about himself, all the time. He was super direct and rude. Everything he did was in order to be superior then others. He was always super awkward in social groups and that made me tired. I don't know why I put up with him for so long. But I could not take it anymore. If you deny yourself in a friendship, you never truly connect with someone.  Making new friends is pretty hard, especially if you have to start over again later in life. I wish 10 years ago I knew what good friends are really about, then I would have picked some other people to build relationships with
-1	negative	loneliness	who is decided why we live and why we will die to defend? NOW FIGHT!!!!!
-9	negative	loneliness	Who is my mother? I came to America a short time before the occasion of my 14 birthday. I spoke English like a foreign born yet I was granted citizenship due to having an American National mother. There is an issue though. I have never met her. My certificate of birth and other documents I showed at the embassy earned me the right to live here yet I have no clue who gave birth to me. 
-20	negative	loneliness	Who knew there were so many pregnant womenor that there were so many babies? Moving forward is hard, especially with so many painful reminders. Each time I see a picture of one of my smiling pregnant friends or hear a baby cry, it's like a knife is being shoved through my heart. But I've decided to fake it til I make it. So today I got up, washed my hair, slapped on some mascara and went shopping. Again, who knew there were so many baby shops!? Hubby and i also went for counseling and for the first time I realized how hard this has been on him. All this time he has been wiping my tears and reassuring me when he also needed a little love and attention. So I'm dusting myself off and smiling through my tears because I have to believe that things will get better. The hurt will never go away but it will become manageable. Or so they say
-4	negative	loneliness	Why am I sad? Is it  because at long last my guy best friend asked my girl best friend? So while I was heading to my vball practice, I putted on my headphones and not knowing I'm having a teary eyes.
-1	negative	loneliness	Why am i so alone i have a lot of friends but i feel so alone i feel like nobody in this entire world will ever understand me and when i think about that i feel like crying my eyes out
-8	negative	loneliness	Why am I that generous? Is it called generous or just playing stupid? Giving him away to someone he doesn't like even though we know that we have feelings for  each other. One thing I know is, I still haven't learned my lesson. I'm always thinking about my friends and what makes them happy, that's how I love them. I'll even risk my own feelings and happiness for them.
-3	negative	loneliness	Why are my needs so bizarre and out there. Is there any one who understands and can see a persons soul ?  So lonely.
-1	negative	loneliness	Why does love hurt so much? I'm trying to get over a girl I thought was the one for me. Now it's like she just doesn't want anything to do with me
-6	negative	loneliness	Why does society act like we are not all lonely, everything is a facade, we have the media portraying all these fake people who are trying to portray happiness, but the truth of the matter is that we are ALL alone, and being singular beings we are lonely! We are taught to embrace happiness and we are never taught to accept out loneliness! It exists
-1	negative	loneliness	Why do i feel like nobody cares about me ughh 
-1	negative	loneliness	Why do I push everyone out of my own life and went they left, i go into a state of selfpity.
-3	negative	loneliness	Why do people only show they care when it's too late? Is it through fear of rejection? Or that you only know what you had once you've lost it?  People should show if they care about someone, because you never know how they feel. You never know how much they long to feel wanted.
-5	negative	loneliness	Why most of guys makes the girl feel the most special, woos her, goes out of the way to make her happy etc., till he can win her. After he treats her very normally, because he now knows that she's his and she isn't going anywhere!?
-1	negative	loneliness	Why must he be soooooo flippin perfect!!!!!!!!
-4	negative	loneliness	Wife is dragging me down.  All things come to an end, whether it was for the good or for the bad. Being on your own after you've been with someone for a long time has it's ups and downs.
-4	negative	loneliness	wife of 25 years says she is not in love with me anymore there is nothing worse than loosing your best friend trying to make new ones hope to find them here
-1	negative	loneliness	With out any explanation, they should already know why
-4	negative	loneliness	Without anyone to talk with, see or hear, just on my own what do I fear? When it's just the world listening and talking to me, when I see the grand view of myself exposed, what will I see?
-12	negative	loneliness	Woke up cramping with light spotting. I went to the emergency room and after hours they said I have a cyst and I am possibly miscarrying. My HCG levels are lower than they should be for 8 weeks and they can't see my baby or a heart beat. I am pretty sad about it, being that I had 4 abortions already and wanted to make it through this pregnancy. I feel like God is teaching me a lesson since I was taking matters into my own hands before. I hope my baby is okay so I can love it when it gets here, otherwise I will be devastated that my baby is actually dead in me and I have to wait for it to come out. Very sad
-3	negative	loneliness	Would love it if anyone around my age wanted to talk x I'm 15, not really sure why my prof says 17 x
-11	negative	loneliness	Wouldn't it be nice to have someone that loved me. The pure and simple kind of love that you see in the happiest couples. The trusting and intimate love that gives you security and confidence. Yeah I know, all relationships take work, but true love does not. True love is just there, and makes it worth the work that has to be put into the rest of the relationship. It holds you together, happily, while you are working on the rest. Wouldn't that be nice
-8	negative	loneliness	Wow it has been 6 months already I can't believe it only 3 more months left then he will be home I'm so happy I can't wait until I have him home and can finally have him close to me again. I honestly never thought this deployment would ever be over ahhh I am so happy 
-2	negative	loneliness	.. Yeah i badly needed one..  I'm really sad now and it kills me inside! 
-2	negative	loneliness	Yeah send me a message me and let's be friends :D
-3	negative	loneliness	Yea I never told but dad did it I can't even discus it on here fu@# im so close to ending myself
-1	negative	loneliness	yep I just cant be around them of a while.  when I feel hurt.  there are some that have been shut out forever and other that when they want to know how to get back in . 
-2	negative	loneliness	Yes and I'd like to keep it that way. Sometimes it's just better to keep things to yourself.
-2	negative	loneliness	Yes. I am. But it'll be ok. I know it's just for a moment in time & I'll forget about it in my sleep
-3	negative	loneliness	Yes, I had the same song stuck in my head for 3 years. My mom loved the long too so she didn't mind, but after a while she started asking me if there was something wrong with me. lol
-2	negative	loneliness	Yes I kinda think like everyone is going to reject md
-5	negative	loneliness	Yesterday a girl I knew committed suicide. Her name was Amanda Todd. You can search her on google if you want, she's been in the news and everything. **EDIT** The RIP Amanda Todd Facebook page has over a MILLION likes now.
-5	negative	loneliness	Yesterday at school: Stomach Flu was going around. I ate lunch, and the meat tasted weird. I didn't want to eat it but ate it anyway so that I wouldn't have hunger pains later. My stomach starts hurting so badly that I think I am about to puke. I am feeling puking sensations. I go to the nurse's office (which is rare for me) and end up skipping a whole 55 minutes just laying on the cot because my cramping and nausea is so bad. I though I had stomach flu.one day later-Op. Just my period.
-10	negative	loneliness	Yesterday I was curling my 14year  olds daughters hair, she looked at me and said your face looks pretty, I said thanks she asked why I had makeup on  I told her because I wanted to look niceShe goes what for your just mom you don't do anything but take care of us kids. It hit me right then and there I have lost ME. I've lost myself to my family and kids who I love dearly but I realized I need to stop and find  myself .
-18	negative	loneliness	Yesterday was a hard day. Some days are much easier than others with being able to stay busy. I love my marine and he is in recon training right now and it's hard to talk to him because they have them training for so long and by the end of the day he just crashes. He is amazing because he calls and texts me every chance he gets but he just sounds so defeated. The good news is that I may be able to see him for valentines day weekend  I really hope this comes through because it's been about 8 months since I've seen him. All the other times that we have tried to get together it falls apart. The military comes first, I know that. Just would like to have him for a weekend.
-13	negative	loneliness	Yes this experience certainly describes me. I'm a 32-year-old mother of 2 small children. I work full time. When not working, I'm usually spending time alone with the kids, with no adult company. I used to have a best friend with whom I shared everything but that friendship ended. Because of this, I have difficulty trusting people now, so forming close friendships is next to impossible. I hope it won't always be this way.   Nonetheless, I crave having an adult I can just sit down and talk to. Extra points if the person actually cares about what I'm saying. If you're interested, you can look up my stories to see what I'm going through and what I'm about.  Talk to you soon.
-2	negative	loneliness	You can concentrate more as thoughts are keep on entering your brain. All I need is myself, my pen and paper or a laptop.
-7	negative	loneliness	You ever get in one of those moods where it feels like everybody is ignoring you especially that someone you like? No texts, no calls,no emails, no nothing. It's like you would give almost anything to talk to anyone that's not your family
-17	negative	loneliness	You know God blessed me with a beautiful child. Some people never had the pleasure of bearing children. God gave him to me for a short time, but that time was great, blessed, and rewarding, God show me his graces, I should be happy. It's only in death of someone we love so dear that we question our faith in him, what we can't see is so easy to put blame on,When we are happy in our lives then it's easy to praise him, thank him for all the good that we have. But I remember all the wonderful things that he gave me and the things that I lost.He is still my father even when I question his laws and his rights, I'm greatful for the many years i had with my beloved son Charles. I thank you God for showing me your graces ,I should be happy.                                          page44
-17	negative	loneliness	You know i have a real problem. I have a feeling, that won't go away, it keeps running me down, its like a shadow , it sticks by me like a new love, no matter how much i tell it, i don't want it, i don't care for it, it keeps sticking by me like its my new found friend,how many times do i have to tell it, to get lost. leave me alone. if i lock my door on it, it keeps pushing its way back in, when i sleep at night, it shows up, who do you think you are? i'm sick and tired of it, it thinks i can live with out it, and it trying to push me to the edge, it wants to win, it tells me if i keep it in my life, i'll get used to it, so stop fighting me.just remember how much I ment to you, how much it cared for me, how much it was there for me. how much it helped me, this thing is sick, i asked it , what is your name,? it tolds me, I know it well, i ate with it, i slept with it, i walked with it, i lived with it, but still tell me your name?.           page70
-8	negative	loneliness	You know that depression hits when you feel like not being alive every  You become a burden in your own life A weird thing to say, I know. You feel afraid of waking up and feeling the same way who knows until when. There's no easy way to overcome what haunts you. Nobody can really help, people who have never felt this way don't really comprehend the impact of this in your life. I've come to terms with the idea that I'll have to feel this way may be for ever. No matter what I do, it will mean to attempt leaving "my curse" behind. Do I really want to live this way? Of course I don't. Will I do something? I'll try, yes, but nothing guarentees success on the long run and I know deep down that is my biggest fear: being forever stuck
-6	negative	loneliness	You know that holiday that comes in February, where people celebrate their love for each other? Valentines Day? Well, yeah. My Airman will be gone on a TDY in L.A. and I'm trying to think of a cute package to put together to send to him.. ideas on what to put in it?? They would be greatly appreciated!!
-2	negative	loneliness	You know who wants to have a good time? Me. Several times in a row. In several different positions even. 
-4	negative	loneliness	You know you're a military girlfriend when you want to punch every happy couple in the face that walks past you.
-2	negative	loneliness	You know you're lonely when you hug your pillow for comfort. :/
-3	negative	loneliness	You've proven me rightand it never felt so bad to get my way.
-1	negative	loneliness	You were my friend for just over a year  
-3	negative	loneliness	You wouldn't know to look at me.  I look okay.  On possibly my worst day recently a cashier at the store asked the standard,  "How are you today?"  My reply, "I'm goodand you?"  How can you mask pain and move through life as if everything is fine?  Simple really.you have no choice.   I cry alone.  I cry about things that I can't tell anyone about, so there's no comfort.  I was two breaths away from telling my sister tonight about my affair.  I knew she would probably try to understandat the very least be supportive and helpful.  I can't carry this around all the time.  I know I can't ask to be forgiven for my sins, but I need some guidance.  I need help.
-4	negative	loneliness	You would think if one of your best friends has recently just attempted suicide and is currently lying completely paralysed fighting for her life you would think differently about life. But recently I haven't. My thoughts are just getting worse and worse. I always promised Lauren if she ever left me I would follow her, now that I find myself in the situation I feel like I'm breaking her promise.
-1	negative	loneliness	Yup   someone pleaseeee ! Ha..
-4	negative	loss-to-suicide	17 years ago my cousin lost her life in a car accident. She didn&rsquo;t stop at a stop sign and drove straight into a speeding truck. She lost her life immediately. It was her mother&rsquo;s birthday. They lived in the States.
-11	negative	loss-to-suicide	2005, January 23, My Sisters best friend took suicide, And because of this My sister got really depressed and took her life February 2. My mum and dad found her in the bathroom. Then at 2008, Juny 28 I found my mum and dad talking in the kitchen. I was just 12 and just thought they were talking normally, I was wrong. 4 days later I found both of them hanging in the kitchen with a suicide note saying: I'm so sorry son, We felt so deppresed after your sister took her life and can't stand it anymore. Forgive us. How can I come over this?
-14	negative	loss-to-suicide	4 years ago I lost my cousin. he was overseas and something happened to him. when I got to the hospital to see him, I had ready started to shut everyone out. when I saw him he had just gotten out of surgery and he didn't want to see anyone else but me. about 2-3 hours later he died with my arms around him. the last words I said to him was "I love you". I've never said those words to anyone again. his death killed my and still to the day it does. I had to be sedated because I was so hurt. I was hurting other people and myself. I miss him som much. sometimes I don't know how I go on with out him. I just want to lock myself I'm my room . cry and yell and punch walls.
-8	negative	loss-to-suicide	6 years ago I moved to another city. I just turned 13 years old and went to a new high school (high schools in my country are from 12-1. The first weeks I went to school everything seemed to be normal, I was just finding my place in my new class.  Even though I didn't know him very well, or was his friend, it was, and still is, something I think about a lot. It truly had a deep impact on my life.
-7	negative	loss-to-suicide	9 years ago, my boyfriend had a heart attack in his sleep and died. A month later, one of my friends and two of her children died in a fire. I found comfort in food. Years later, I realized what I was doing to myself and began trying hard to lose. I started doing okay, but then on the last day of tax season last year (201, I was notified of my mother's alleged suicide. Now once again I am battling demons - loneliness, heartbreak and unresolved emotions.
-4	negative	loss-to-suicide	About 15 year years ago my dad killed himself. With that strange experience I returned my to book. About 15 minutes minutes later police came to my door with news my father had committed suicide about 10 days before he was found.
-5	negative	loss-to-suicide	About  five years ago now I lost my elder brother to Pancreatic Cancer.  It was very sudden and took us all by surprise. When first diagnosed he was given six months to live which turned out to be only six weeks. I was free for most of his last days but because we were expecting six months, the urgency to make more of the time we did have left didn't really seem quite so urgent until his rapid decline in the last two weeks. 
-4	negative	loss-to-suicide	A couple days ago on March 27,2013 my pom-chi archy got hit by a car and died instantly my terrier had ran out and he was.going.after him as soon as he.stepped.foot in the street a.car hit him in the head he was so careless.and.clueIess i miss him so much! He was the life of my house he was clumsy and dorky he was always playing. He was full of.life. he loved playing with my other dog who is a terrier mix. He was his shadow. His imperfections made him perfect he was so tiny he left so many memories. That's all we're left with :'( I feel this emptiness inside of me a feeling that wont.go away I keep thinking of all the things he would do of how he was always happy and excited I miss him.. he didn't deserve to die. Not like that.  
-19	negative	loss-to-suicide	A few days ago I found out that my friend's grandpa was in the hospital and it wasn't looking good at all.  After hearing the news I walked up to my apartment thinking about my friend and hoping that he would be okay and that she would be able to visit him before things got worse.  I was worried because I knew she was working and unable to leave and it really sounded like he wasn't going to make it.  I said a little prayer and as I reached my floor I looked down and saw a dime heads up.  I picked it up and looked at it.  It had my birth year on it.  Somehow seeing that dime made me realize he would be okay.  Hours later my friend was able to go visit her grandpa and he is still doing good. 
-11	negative	loss-to-suicide	After reading through so many stories on EP, I was shocked to see the number of people devastated by the loss of a loved one by suicide.  I also noticed a lot of recurring themes; unexpected act, the person seemed to be happy, friends and family were unaware of treatment, and the person never sought treatment.  One of the main things I learned is that depression is a very personal issue, and people choose many different ways in how to cope with it.  Most people are afraid to admit their condition for fear of embarrassment, or at least afraid to share it with people they care about.  It was sad to read how many people were completely shocked that their friend/relative would be in such a state of despair without seeking help. 
-7	negative	loss-to-suicide	Almost 7 years ago I lost my father to suicide and everyday that goes by I wish he was here. I wasn't there for my father like a daughter should be and we didn't have the best relationship, but I choose not to dwell on the past but embrace the time I had with him. If someone you know or if you're ever considering suicide please talk to someone, or even me. You're not worthless and you're important and I wish I was there to tell my dad that. The effects of suicide are unbearable and loved ones will blame themselves. Life does get better, but I wish my dad was here to enjoy it and experience it with me.
-5	negative	loss-to-suicide	Alright so I'm turning 18 next month and still never had a girlfriend. It kinda upsets me because i see all these other couples in school and it makes me jealous(not spiteful) and now I can get the thought of not having a gf out of my head.
-4	negative	loss-to-suicide	A month ago, I lost my boyfriend. We had been dating for 1 year, 3 months, and 8 days. I loved him so much. I can't believe that he'd do this to himself. It still hurts everyday. I cry everyday. I haven't been to work in over a month because I can't face being with people who are always smiling and happy. It makes me jealous that I was once happier than ever, and it was taken from me.

-18	negative	loss-to-suicide	apart from my family i had one friend his name was Adrian and the guy really loved me. we met when i was in primary school (grade  and he was a transfer student so his sister asked me to help him out. we became very close that people thought we were siblings the guy was ready to do anything just for me to be happy. that time i was the fat kid in school but no one dared to bully me because they were scared that he will beat them. in grade 4 i moved to another school and i thought that friendship was going to die but this guy kept on coming to my house even when i joined boarding school he was always there to say hi. no one has ever shown me that care and attention in my life. i miss him everyday especially when i need a true friend and a shoulder to cry on. they say time heals all wounds but i think my wound refused to heal.

-2	negative	loss-to-suicide	At first its fine and you think you have a dark side  it's exciting.
-1	negative	loss-to-suicide	At my school I often hear the word suicide. I hear it being said in that disgusting way. As a joke. As if it wasn't a problem. Sure, there aren't a lot of problems with it in this country. Especially not in a puny city like this. But that doesn't mean they have the right to just spew out stupid jokes about it. Because it's not a joking matter!
-5	negative	loss-to-suicide	Back to work today after my aunt's funeral this past Saturday. I was "happy" to have work to do and determined to remain focus in the present moment. I was all set until the tears unexpectantly came gushing out while driving. Had to pull to the side of the road. The tears and hurt are there, raw. I realize how cruel death is. I wouldn't say I was close to my aunt however, she had a place in my heart deeper than I ever knew until it's too late.

-6	negative	loss-to-suicide	ription drug overdose has changed me and my world forever. I continue to try to find meaning to what has happened and seem to always fall short of a meaning that is acceptable. I wasn't a part of her life until the last year, and I understand my part in her demise.  I continue to struggle with this daily and I don't believe I will ever be the same again

That shes stupid for trying to do it while we were in the house? That shes so stupid for letting our brothers see her? shes so fvcking stupid!! im still soo mad at her cuz she didnt think that i wont be able to sleep months after that and that her little brothers will always see that picture of how much blood there was,that it would kill my parents if she succeded. she didnt think!  i love her and i cant describe how happy i am that shes still alive and i cant explain,but she killed me that day.
-4	negative	loss-to-suicide	Chris I love you, and you'll never be forgotten. I know we weren't dating for long, but I still love you. I always will. Yes you acted like everything was fine and told me you were okay, but I'm not mad. I'm just sad.. I miss you. I wish  I could have helped. &lt;3

-16	negative	loss-to-suicide	Daniel and I had almost been dating for a year. We were in a long distance relationship. He was going to be a senior and I will be a junior (both in high school). His dad was abusive so he moved into one of his friends apartments and had to shut his phone off. He was at his jobs all day so I would wait until close to midnight to email him. Last Tuesday, for some reason, I tried breaking up with him. 5 minutes after I did it, I regretted it. He said it would be better for me if he was gone, which obviously wasn't true, I told him not to. I asked him to please not do it. I told him instill loved him. But, it was too late. I feel like it was all my fault. That if I wouldn't of said that, he would still be here. That if I wouldn't of said that, his parents wouldn't hate me. His friends wouldn't hate me. And I promise him that if he did it, so would I. I have yet to break a promise. I just haven't found the right time. And I don't know if I want to or not.
-19	negative	loss-to-suicide	Dear Rob, I finally sent your candy. I hope you love it. But mostly, I hope when you open it, when you read the card, when you see the cute pictures some of the girls drew you, I hope you feel loved. I hope you realize how important you are. I hope you know how much we all love you. Cuz I can't seem to tell you in any other way, so I send you candy. I make you cookies, and toffee, and other treats, hoping, at some point, you'll realize that your loved.

-9	negative	loss-to-suicide	December 2007; I remember the day ever so well. I often feel upset and guilty that maybe if I went with her that night I could have prevented all of this from happening. A few months ago, after her 5th anniversary I took an overdose. Everything felt worthless and I didn't want to be here. I am majorily depressed and still get days when I want to end it all. I always wonder how different my life would be if I had a Mom, but I guess I will have to keep wondering
-1	negative	loss-to-suicide	Decisions i should of thought about a long time ago
-2	negative	loss-to-suicide	Due to eviction, I had to give up my lovely little max, I miss him so much. I wish It didn't have to be that way. But a really nice woman is looking after him with 15 other dogs xD I'm glad that he's being looked after well though :') I know it's very painful, but as long as your dog is being looked after, it'll be alright.

-4	negative	loss-to-suicide	Every day I go to school, people always mock me, always make fun of me because I cut. No one tries to help me or anything. I always have this poem in my head: 
-2	negative	loss-to-suicide	for Pastor Rick Warren his wife and family due to the loss of their son through suicide.  Knowing this shock and pain so well, I encourage those who share in this journey of grief to pray for the family as the proceed through the the tangled web of the grief. Warmly, wmec620
-4	negative	loss-to-suicide	For those who have in a family someone with PTSD is helpful this program, especially if sufferer refuses to go to a therapist. I was thinking that here are many people in my situation and this program would be helpful. 
-9	negative	loss-to-suicide	Gracie worried about everything since the day Tina told her "No one can be trusted." Gracie beleived everything Tina said. Gracie stopped trusting her mom, dad, and her sister Anna first. Then came her teachers, workers, and everyone. Eventually, Gracie even wondered if she should trust Tina! Then came herself. Gracie's worries eventually told her to comit suicide.  Help kids like Gracie protest against kids like Tina. 
-1	negative	loss-to-suicide	Have you ever promised your friend you wouldn't cut anymore but you did anyway?
-3	negative	loss-to-suicide	He hung himself outside his house. Leaving his wife of 40+ years alone. I looked up to him so much, but he's just a coward to me now.
-3	negative	loss-to-suicide	He killed himself on February 24th, 2012. I was in 9th grade and he was in 10th. Only fifteen years old and wanted to die. I think about that all the time. Key words: I wish.
-12	negative	loss-to-suicide	Hello everyone! I'm new to this site and happy to write. I've never written anything anonymously, but it seems like a good outlet. My best friend told me about three weeks ago she has been wanting to kill herself for the past three years. I have done everything I can think of, researching, calling around, talking to her about it. I feel like, despite my best efforts, I'm not helping the way a friend should. I feel like any second I'm going to get a phone call that she's gone through with it and it scares me. I'm the only person she's told and she refuses to let me tell anyone, and I haven't. I know I should tell someone, but I couldn't forgive myself if it backfired. She tries to explain how it feels but, try as I might, I can't relate the way I wish I could. I've never been suicidal or depressed like her, and I feel like I'm thinking us both into a hole. Any suggestions? Thank you for anything, even if you only read this 
-20	negative	loss-to-suicide	Here is something that might help you guys with this, and this is coming from somebody who had his first actual thought of suicide at 12 and I'm 38 now, and throw in the mental illness (ADHD & Bipolar), the cutting, the beatings I received at school from other students, and the medications I have to take.  I have had to deal with my issues of suicide mostly by myself because that is a choice I have made in my adult years, because it makes my recovery harder then it has to be, if it gets where I need to talk, I have people I can talk to if need be. Be that person who makes that difference, and unfortuantely some times nothing we do will make a difference, it just doens't we see it in the paper and on the net all the time, but hopefully that person you talk to might think before they try it that YOU at least took the time to say something.
-11	negative	loss-to-suicide	Her name was Amanda, and she was the first girl I'd ever dated. Right after she left at the tender age of 17, I spent all my time wondering just why exactly did she choose to do what she did. On the most superficial of levels, she did seem to have a pretty good life. However, much apparently, something must've happened somewhere along the way, something (or a compounding of lesser things) that could compel her to leave everything behind for another place. Whether she was running away from something or towards something, I don't know. I don't think I ever will.  Still, that does zilch to eliminate the guilt. We were together for a full year and a half; she chose to leave 9 months after we ended things. Her parents, staunch social conservatives, opposed to our relationship and I wish there was more I could do about that. I feel like I've let her down and that I've a fault in this. She was the light of my life, death was the darkness of hers. 
-6	negative	loss-to-suicide	he was depressed and killed himself when i was only almost 3 years old. i dont remember him much. actually if it wasnt for the only picture i have of him holding me i wouldnt even remember what he looked like :/  i miss him. 3
-17	negative	loss-to-suicide	He was my best friend. The first friend I ever had. We did some not so good things. I remember one time me and him thought it was a good idea to cook marshmallows in the microwave, and I wasn't. At all. He be the one who would be in the jail cell next to me. We even were in a band together. He did clean vocals, and did the death metal vocals. It soon ended at that. One day I got a phone call from his younger sister, Dani was found in his room dead that morning. He commuted suicide the night before, on the night of my 17th birthday. I miss him so much. R.I.P. Dani, I miss you man.
-2	negative	loss-to-suicide	Hi, for about 5 months ive had anxiety since a sergury,about its changefrom different thins but for four months its been stuck on beig scared that ill go suicidal. What are the exact signs that someone is suicidal? Im deathly afraid of pain and dying but for some reason im scared about this.
-6	negative	loss-to-suicide	Hi! I am an Agoraphobic. I hate coming out of my comfort zone which does not  include sports, social events nor going out. I know it's pathetic but I honestly can't help it. I have very low self confidence. I am trying to try new things to get over this phobia and thus, this Saturday I am going to attend an event that will help me step outside that comfort zone I've trapped myself in. I am terrified about going there and meeting new people as well as doing the activities this workshop will instill.  I am so scared.  Thankyou EP!
-7	negative	loss-to-suicide	Hi , i lost my grandma 7 years ago and i still havent grieved over it properly , me and my grandma were very close and i just miss her loads everyday , i cant even go and visit her grave as i am not in the same region any more as i moved away  i just need help on how to grieve properly as it is affecting my work and i am always feeling down and low.
-5	negative	loss-to-suicide	Hi, this goes out to all those that are suffering from panic, fear and agoraphobia, I know some days can feel pretty low but hang in there, there is life after panic attacks. I suffered through occasional panic attacks that later spiraled into a crippling 4 year battle with agoraphobia and constant anxiety but through patience and determination, i got through it and so can you! 
-9	negative	loss-to-suicide	How selfish can one be? My long distance ex writes to me all the time saying he still loves me and cares for me. But at the same time he is sleeping around with other girls while he is telling me that no one comes close to the love he had for me. How can some guys say things like that to you but be with other people? It's killing me 
-16	negative	loss-to-suicide	I actually don't know when but my uncle died because of suicide in 2005. I was very young so my mom lied to me she said that god wanted him back home. it took like 7 years to actually find out what happened to my uncle. since I was very young I don't remember much about him but, I really do wish he was here with me. I remember when I was in the car his favourite band/song comes on I would always cry and when I would get home I'm full on sobbing and I cried myself to sleep, and to be honest I still cry myself to sleep. my uncle, Myles, died of suicide he shot himself no one knows why he did it but he did and it'll be a mystery, I guess.. it's basically the worst thing that had happened to me oh how I wished he was right he next to me or at least near me but, I do know his spirit is alway watching me and protecting me. I'm glad I know he'll be watching over me.  I will always love you Myles. &lt;33
-5	negative	loss-to-suicide	I actually have quiet a few. My biggest one is probably eight inches across and its on my stomach. I had to get surgery when I was born and its been there ever since. That same scar had to be reopened a few months ago for another surgery because I had an ovarian cyst and it caused me a lot of abdominal pain and they removed it.
-3	negative	loss-to-suicide	i also cur my thighs cuz its a better place for no one to see and it hurts just as much.
-4	negative	loss-to-suicide	I always carried him through everything hard, even when he started to walk.  My sister and I took turns lugging him around and watching over him. It gets better, it has to.  
-24	negative	loss-to-suicide	I am 15 years old. I have just recently lost my mom. it was 18 days after my 15th birthday so she has been gone for almost 6 months now and its killing me. I didnt lose her cancer or another illness but to suicide. I remember the day, it was a Monday (sadly) and i was gonna go to my boyfriend (now ex) house so i was coming home from the bus stop when i noticed that my dads car was in drive way and not my moms so i thought she went to the store and i thought my dad had an early day off so i was pretty happy. I lost it. I am still heart broken. I miss her so much. She was my best friend. I could talk to her about anything and everything. We went shopping together and got our nails and stuff done together. This has been such a large impact on my life. She was my world and mow she is gone from me. I sometimes think if she even loved me enough. How could she leave me like that? I will never know. 
-6	negative	loss-to-suicide	I AM A SELF HARMER  IM NOT SAD NOR MAD AT MYSELF FOR CUTTIN NOR AM I ASHAMED. THOSE SCARS REMIND ME EVERYDAY WHAT I HAVE BECOME WHAT I HAVE GOTTIN PASS WHAT I HAVE FOUGHT FOR WHAT I NEED TO GET OVER AND WHO I WILL NOT BECOME. SO YES I AM A SELF HARMER AND PROUD OF MY MOMENTS WHERE I WAS BONDED TO THE BLADE CAUSE I BECAME WHO I AM AND THE SCARS TO SHOW FOR IT.
-4	negative	loss-to-suicide	I am a wife and mother.  I've stayed at home with my kids for 12 years, and now desire to do something for myself. I'm 37, and don't know what I want to be when I grow up.  Feeling like I stink at everything.  I don't have a hobby and I've never felt more content then when my babies were little Now it's time for me to branch out, and I'm stuck
-1	negative	loss-to-suicide	I am exactly like this, and that's why I keep on running.
-5	negative	loss-to-suicide	I am going through therapy.  I attend group meetings and whoa lets talk about severe flashbacks happening. I am almost afraid of spending time alone with myself. I need constant distractions to keep my thoughts occupied. Now even that is not working. Poof .just like that. No advance warning without explanation my head is playing a full movie of an event I am not even sure if I lived. It's me but was it an actual event or just my mind playing tricks on me. I don't know and I don't really want to know. I am ok with not paying attention to those unknown issues. I have no problem with denial in this case. I am hopeful I can move onyet seems like moving on means going way back first and if I hid it in a deep dark place. Maybe it just needs to stay there. 
-3	negative	loss-to-suicide	I am the perfect example of not being perfect. I would hate to be perfect. It's all the little imperfections that make us what we are.
-6	negative	loss-to-suicide	I can honestly say that I love my kitty, Rocky, almost as much as I will love my daughter when I adopt her. (I plan to adopt a four to six year old little girl in the future.) I can't believe that somebody else put up a post right before I did about their cat that's still alive that's about to pass. Thank you Sara10101010. [hugs]
-5	negative	loss-to-suicide	I cannot believe it has been two years since I last cut myself.  I still trace the scars at night and I still remember the way the blade felt on my skin.  I look at those scars and I can still see the fresh blood from years ago.  And I'm still haunted by it.  I'm too numb to feel the pain those memories should bring me but the ghost of the pain I felt before is more present now than it has ever been.  I'm angry because I can't feel the pain and I feel guilty for even wanting to.
-4	negative	loss-to-suicide	I cannot find the post someone made several days ago and wanted to thank that person for their words. "Everyone misses you" has been ringing through my head since I read it and reminds me I would not just be committing suicide, but making some people in my life very sad. Since I can remember, I have had thoughts of suicide. This is why I have not gone through with it. My mom, my brother, my friends don't need that black spot in their lives. Thank you for the post. You may not have really known the person you wrote about, as you stated, but missing someone you can't bring back is a feeling I don't want to give people. 
-1	negative	loss-to-suicide	I cant find a chat room for ptsd and Im about to go off the chain . there r no ptsd chat rooms WTF, I need ta talk to some 1.
-7	negative	loss-to-suicide	I cut on my lower legs cause if I slit my wrist everyone will see. There are a lot of scars that aren't healing. Every time it look down I remember why I have them. The story they tell aren't pleasant. I don't like to do it, I don't like the memories but once you start it's hard to stop.
-7	negative	loss-to-suicide	Ida May was my babysitter. She always had a smile to share with me, and a laugh to give. Ida comitted suicide last year. She was lost in her thoughts, and drove off the highway. I remember getting the phone call. I remember hearing the news from her parents. Ida May can't come over tonight, or any night. She is no longer here. She comitted suicide. To this day, I can not grasp the fact that she is gone. I still expect her to show up, smiling. "Hi, hi! Sorry, sorry!"  I remember hearing the news. I remember Ida May. 
-4	negative	loss-to-suicide	Idk i luv it and at the same time hate itthe feeling is great,but the scars are horrible.but even tho itz wrong,i cant and i WONT stop.i should have never started,cuz once i did the feelings were bittersweet.almost so addictive i think about it more than anything.so its not just that its really hard to stop,but its also my only friend.and sadly,itz the only one tht doesnt leave like the othersitz so complicated ;(
-8	negative	loss-to-suicide	i don't have a cat. i never had one until this year when i lived with a housemate that has one. at first i was afraid of my housemate's cat but as time went by i grew to love maisie his cat. i loved feeding her, petting her beautiful fur, chasing her around. she had always made my day. i used to be excited going home to see her waiting by the door. i never thought that i will love maisie but i really did and i still do. since my housemate will be going away for another job, maisie was given to my housemate's mom. she left yesterday, and i so miss her. i know that i will never see her again and that makes me so sad. to maisie, thank you for being my friend even for such a short time and i will never forget you. =)
-17	negative	loss-to-suicide	I don't know what else to do Iv tried therapy nothing works. All I want to do is find someone who really understands how I'm feeling. I lost my dad to suicide 18 months today.he was my everything I had lived with him alone my whole life. I was 21 when my dad hung himself and I really don't know why. I know he had always been depressed but I never thought he would leave me the last thing he said was he loves me he won't do nothing stupid but he just needs to clear his head. I never see him again. For 18months now I am in a dark place I have isolated myself from the world and no one understands. I miss him so much I am now 7 months pregnant and this is the only light in my life but I really know its the only thing keeping me alive if it wasnt for the baby I would want to join my dad. Will it ever get easier?
-10	negative	loss-to-suicide	I don't know why he did it but he's gone. My cousin and I always faught but he was my cousin and I loved him. Yesterday, the day before Thanksgiving my cousin shot himself. I haven't seen him in such a long time now I just wish that I would have went to see him maybee I could talked to him made him feel better. I hope he sees how mich he is missed and how much he was loved. 
-11	negative	loss-to-suicide	I dont quite know where to beginguess ill start with the basics. Im a 24 year old with 2 beautiful daughters. 4 and 3. Up until today I had an outstanding manhe decided he was going to call it quits (due to lying) until I can learn to be honest and a few otherbthings.lying was the biggest reason. We have been together nearly 4 years. And now my world is shaken. Not that he is wrong for doing soI just cant believe that it got to this point. That is my motivation.  I must stop to maintain my family. And to be a role model for my 2 young daughters.  This is the most open and honest I have ever been about this subject but it has gone too far. Any advice?
-15	negative	loss-to-suicide	I dont really recall when it all started. I remember making that first cry of red tears at the age of 13 (start of year seven). I remember how I was feeling as it happened. My friend was going through a hard time and I couldnt cope, with how she was coping with it herself. From then onwards, it became my way of release. Something I could control. I was usually a person who didnt give two cares of what someone said about me, but as I soon realized, very quickly, that this itself in a whole, was false. I guess I just bottled it all up and I had to let it out.
-2	negative	loss-to-suicide	I fell for him and he didn't even stumble.
-16	negative	loss-to-suicide	I first experienced suicide in 1973.  I was 17.  It was a snowy March day when I was driving home from high school and I saw the sheriff and the ambulance in front of my house.   My little brother who was a freshman in high school was in the passenger seat.  We saw them carrying out my dad in a body bag.  Dad had shot himself.  I never understood why.  I never thought anything was wrong and I never got to say goodbye.  Why, dad, why?  He was always there for me, then he wasn't. My 19 year old daughter is all I have left and now I worry about her when she gets a little sad.  She has also expressed the same concern about me.
-6	negative	loss-to-suicide	If you are thinkin of committing suicide tonight and you are looking for a sign not to, here is your sign. Do not committ suicide because there is so much ahead for you. I love you and I believe in you. You are amazing
-12	negative	loss-to-suicide	I graduated hs in January but I wasn't 18 so it was hard finding a good job. My sons father got a job the end of February for 10 an hr. and he loves the good so I was happy for him. March I finally turned18 so I started looking all over. And I got a job that makes buns for McDonald's & many other companies. We also make muffins. I'm really excited but really nervous. I start this Monday!! It starts out on 13.10 then after my 90 days probation when they decide to keep me or not it will move to 14.10 and after 6 months of being there it goes to 15.10 plus a 200 bonus. I'm ready to move out of my moms home and this is it!!!
-8	negative	loss-to-suicide	I guess the first thing I should confess is that he wasn't really my brother.  He was my first cousin  half-cousin at that (dad's half sister's son)  but when his parents died he came to live with us and "became" my big brother. He was six months older than me. His little brother six months younger than me  and my "real" brother a year younger than me. "J" and I were the oldest of the four and we ruled over the two younger ones. lol .I love you, bro. Thanks for always looking out for me. I wish I could have done more to take care of you  I'm sorry.
-6	negative	loss-to-suicide	I had 22 people over for dinner today. They started showing up around 3 and the last of them are just now leaving. My house is in shambles..50lbs of turkey is gone and I have 3 beers left. These people get on my nerves. I have taken short retreats into the family room in the baI am done for the night.
-9	negative	loss-to-suicide	I had a baby conure, only about a year old and we named him Skittles. Lately he's been sleeping under my chin and in my neck during naps, but never all night.  I came home late last night and decided to give him some attention. He fell asleep under my neck and I just couldn't stay awake. I just knocked out. I woke up an hour ago and looked in his cage to see him. But he was underneath me And I can't stop crying. I hate myself because everyone I know was attached to him too and they are all going to hate me. He was the sweetest thing, he was my baby.
-7	negative	loss-to-suicide	I had a favorite cousin named John.  My mom and I lived with my grandparents, and he would come over after school.  He was 7 years older than me, but he would take time and play with me like a big brother. My mom said sometimes he was the only one who could get me to stop crying. I miss him very much. RIP, John.
-4	negative	loss-to-suicide	I had been good friends with Amy since elementary school and we shared everything, that was until the day when her parents decided to change religion and embrace the Mormon (LDS) faith. From that day on everything changed. To me the reason for her killing herself is a simple one, religion forced her into a life that she did not want and saw only one way out. Because of these Mormons and their influence on her family, my friend was denied her future and her very life.
-11	negative	loss-to-suicide	I had two dogs that died.  We rescued a golden retriever from Canada four months after his death. Our rat terrier still sniffs under the tree every fall and his old crate. I have dreams that he is still running outside. That since I didn't see him he is still alive. I refuse to believe that he is buried in the woods by my house. The first dog was old and had cancer, we knew she was leaving, but her soul lives on. The Partridge and rabbits she chased run on her grave. The lab still runs wild through the woods in my dreams. No matter what happens, my dogs don't die. They just go to live on in a different existence. We still have the rat and the retriever. No matter what, dogs will figure out how to live on. 
-10	negative	loss-to-suicide	I had two dogs whom I loved dearly.  I took them everywhere with me.  I had a pickup truck, and put a cap on the back.  I replaced the sides and back with screens.  They would come with me to work every day, join me everywhere I went.  My connection to them, particularly the younger one, was very special. For me, coming home to two dogs excited to see me, playing with them, made me miss my dogs that much more.  I think in another month or so I will get another dog.
-3	negative	loss-to-suicide	I hate it how I will be walking around and I hear some dumb chick complaining that she wants to kill herself because her mom took her phone away. -__-
-6	negative	loss-to-suicide	I hate my mind On good days I help people when I can how I can. Sounds typical I know but that's they way I am and I've accepted it, but when the dark of night rolls around I hear things, voices sometimes, sounds other. They don't tell me to do anything in fact they seem to be out to hurt me I can't silence it except when my mind is busy I don't sleep anymore from fear I feel my mind falling apart and I'm falling in a pit Dramatic sounding I know But I can't help but feel the way I do and I've told people who can start helping me find help and they tell me that I'm just full of myself and just trying to attract attention I feel lost in my own head I hate myself for it
-1	negative	loss-to-suicide	I hate when people look at my scars and judge me. I have a dark past that's no secret. But what makes you think it's okay to point and stared. I'm not a freak. Just different.
-6	negative	loss-to-suicide	I have a boy friend  I've only been with him for a little while. But I fell head over heels in love with him. And I always somehow manage to hurt him..I don't mean to. I love him i do. But I have trust issues and intimacy issues. And every guy in my life that has ever told me they love me had left me.  Or hurt me. Or hit me, i love him i really do. But I don't deserve him..
-7	negative	loss-to-suicide	I have attempted it all. I've taken diet pills, strict diets, trainers, and starving myself. I have only ever gotten one to ever work for me. With the pills, diets, and trainers I've only gotten so far with it before the weight would just stop. No matter what I would try after that I would just start gaining, despite the amount of working out would do for me. So I started to starve myself when I was working two jobs and it worked great. I didn't even notice it happening and next thing you know I'm down to 140 pounds. I felt like I was myself for once. I need a starving buddy! I can't do it by myself. 
-12	negative	loss-to-suicide	I have been clean from self harm for about 2 years now, and I have had my wonderful boyfriend Logan for a year. Well last night, we got into a huge argument, because I had no idea where he was. Well I got angry, and I called him some names and ended up breaking it off. We got back together, and I was okay. But then I got this feeling inside I haven't felt in 2 years. I went to bathroom, took a razor and cut my thigh. I felt so awful and I took pills and I just lost it. I felt awful. How could I do this? I don't know what's wrong with me. I just want help.
-5	negative	loss-to-suicide	I have been dead for years already. I've killed myself hundreds of times in my head. I'm not courageous enough to actually do it; I wish I really was. My family thinks I'm the worst daughter/sister. They say what about the one's you've left behind? They will hurt and this will ruin them forever. How selfish of them to think that. They see somebody suffering and all they could think of is themselves not suffering? I've let them all down many times. I'm already dead, but i'm still breathing. 
-14	negative	loss-to-suicide	I have been self-harming for years. It came with the depression, anxiety, OCD and anorexia Nervosa. It's such a hard battle and journey. From cutting too deep on accident, hiding scars, being harassed for cuts accidentally exposed. It's definitely challenging to live with such an addiction. I started self harming when I was eleven and I like to think of myself as a pretty avid cutter. I used to let it define who I was, but hopefully that will no longer be the circumstance when I get older. It gets better I'm sure. I have thousands of scars and they are a part of me just as much as my eye colour and skin tone.
-1	negative	loss-to-suicide	I have changed once or twice before. I am so so sorry.
-3	negative	loss-to-suicide	I have done so many bad things. They make me feel dirty. Tainted. Worthless. I  hate myself for doing them and I still havent forgiven myself. I don't know if i ever will. This is something i will carry, as a way of redemption. As a reminder of how ugly I can really be.
-17	negative	loss-to-suicide	I have had PTSD for over 30 years. I did not know that was what I had until I moved out of Canada to the US, and a Doctor who deals with such recognized what was going on , and got me help. Two years in therapy for it, and I was doing so much better. Then a freaking ef5 tornado ran me over.. yup.. you read that right. That was in May of 2011. I thought I had all the tools to work through it, having been in therapy for 2 years. I finally gave in, and went back into therapy. We are now giving EEP therapy a try. It is improving my sleep, and less anxiety over all. www.eeginfo.com for anyone wanting to read up on it.  Update I am now sleeping 8 hours a night every night. This Eeg therapy is really working. Yay n Chit!!!!!!
-19	negative	loss-to-suicide	I have known my boyfriend for about 6 years now. We liked each other from day one, but just recently we officially became boyfriend/girlfriend. Since then I have been seeing more and more signs of PTSD. Not surprising since we have been spending more time together. So I decided to talk to him about it. He confessed that he knows he has PTSD and that he tried to hide it from me because he was afraid I would leave him. I have always told him that I will be here for him no matter what and that I want to spend the rest of my life with him. He told me that he is getting discouraged because all the medications that he has tried so far have not worked. I want to help him, so I was wondering what medications have worked for others with PTSD? Things have been worse these past 2 weeks, 3 of his friends were killed in Afghanistan and he feels he should have been there to protect them.
-6	negative	loss-to-suicide	I have lost a very close friend, someone online, don't say anything ok. But she was such a good friend I love her so much, she stabbed herself in the lung and died in hospital. I believe although she's biologically dead a soul as beautiful as hers isn't going anywhere just yet.  Love you ellie R.I.P
-2	negative	loss-to-suicide	I havent, but i almost did. That i almost lost a friend.
-18	negative	loss-to-suicide	I haven't cut in awhile. I didn't even miss it anymore. Hardly ever thought about it & lost all the urges. Until my mom & I started arguing again like we used to. It brought up so many past painful memories. I had been fine up until that point. The first argument I just forced myself to sleep, the second one is what tore me down. The things she said, I know she didn't mean them but they got to me. They reminded me of what our home used to be like & I realized I still haven't forgiven myself for what I put my family through. So I left for work early & bought fresh new blades. Had to ask the store clerk to open the glass door because I was buying them for my grandpa. And I cut, for the first time in I don't know how long. I did it. This will be one of my biggest struggles.
-8	negative	loss-to-suicide	I haven't layed a knife to my wrists in 3 years. I used to cut every other day because nasty rumors were being spread about me and I didn't like anyone. Now I have very thin, white scars on both my left and rigbht arm, though more are on my right arm. You can barely even see them now.  I'm glad that I still don't feel horrible and that I'm not cutting anymore, but I still get questions and odd looks when people see my scars and that always leads into an awkward conversation.
-2	negative	loss-to-suicide	I have PTSD and Anxiety due a two year long drama filled with violence and abuse, and not having a safe place, and no help for the one family member that lives here, and of course no money. I did start to write out the full story of what happened to me 2008-2010 yesterday, but it's still painful to go over now, even 3 years later.
-8	negative	loss-to-suicide	i have scars not only on my wrists, but all the way up my arms, stomach, legs, and thighs. all these scars that remind me of all the pain i feel. all these scars remind me of  memories i so badly want to forget, just making me want to add new cuts. nobody understand that cutting becomes an addiction, nobody understands the amount of pain we're in to feel like cutting is the only way we can get through the day. 
-14	negative	loss-to-suicide	I have so much hope for one of my best friends who is currently fighting for her life really, she committed suicide a few weeks ago and left herself brain dead. Things should not have ended this way, I wish she knew how much love and support she had from all of us, she helped me though everything and I helped her but unfortunately it wasn't enough, I just wish we could have answers as to why she felt it all had to end. I guess we will never know. Although I know you will never be the same I have so much hope for you,  I love you so much lauren, keep fighting.
-8	negative	loss-to-suicide	I have stopped cutting. My bestfriend drinks, & I dont like that. I cut, & he doesnt like that. So we made a promise to eachother that he'll stop drinking & ill stop cutting, for good.  I have a stuffed catterpiller on my bed, & I never told ANYBODY this, not even him, but theres a hole in it that you cant really see, & thats where i keep my knife. Im about to take it out. I think hes really helped me. Thank you, Simon. I love you 
-6	negative	loss-to-suicide	I have this fantasy often. How would people react? I'm sure people would be sad, but they'd get over it. They'd move on. They'd forget about me. My life is awful. I can't take it anymore. I'm done. The only thing preventing me from doing it is my parents. The pain I would cause them. I don't want to live anymore. I am so tired of the depression. Of the guilt. Of the constant struggle. I want it to end. Please help me. Please.
-7	negative	loss-to-suicide	I have "ugly" bruises dancing up my arms and seating themselves on my thighs. To me, they're so beautiful And that's my story. My scars and cuts are my art. I look at my body in disgust but when I find my way to the blade marks I find a sense of comfort. The only way I can escape reality, anxiety, myself, others. It's so intriguing to look at each slice and reliving the moment I ran away from. Delicately running my finger tips past the risen skin. Remembering and feeling the relief I'm not an idiot, I know it's temporary. But my cope, and masterpiece are my cuts.. And though I may be judged, I am content with my "sickness".
-7	negative	loss-to-suicide	I heard a news that my dog is taking her last breathe and I am not there . She was my best friend and she understand me very well , I use to take her out and play with her .but he was bit lazy and she like to sleep in my arms . When I go home late . She always wait me in stairs and now my dog is going to die.
-4	negative	loss-to-suicide	I hope you guys won't hate me like the last time I've posted. I don't remember the last time I cut, but I remember what it feels like. I remember the pleasure I used to get from it. I remember every single mark healing on my body.  The most beautiful and inspiring people have scars. Don't ever forget that
-2	negative	loss-to-suicide	I just found out that my friend in England just committed suicide last night. I feel like a pice of my soul dies with him.
-4	negative	loss-to-suicide	I just went through a bad break up and the first thing i thought was "maybe cutting again will stop the pain" but i was afraid that If i started i wouldnt stop again.. My freshman year of high school I would cut myself on a regular basis. A year after that I stopped. So after this break up a few days ago I wanted to feel pain to make me feel better. I didnt want to cut so i figured out a different to get the pain of hurting myself without something that would kill me. For Christmas my dad got me a guitar. I kept playing it over and over again until my fingers hurt and started to get calluses. It made me feel better, got the feelings of hurting myself, and now im better at the guitar! 
-3	negative	loss-to-suicide	I just woke up two hours ago with my poor little lovebird Yoshi crushed underneath me As of lately she would often sleep with me on the couch or in bed or whenever I napped and would cuddle under my neck last night I went to bed late with her still clinging to my shoulder, she snuggled up to me and gave me a cute little chirp before falling asleep with me for the last time I feel like a monster I should have put her in her cage. I killed her. She was only four years old and could have lived so much longer. I am so horribly depressed now, I loved her so much and never wanted to hurt her I am so sorry Yoshi
-3	negative	loss-to-suicide	I knew a girl who liked to draw, STAY STRONG xx
-23	negative	loss-to-suicide	I know several people that has attempted suicide and a few that has succeed that purpose. Some of them I can accepted the fact of ending their lives because of mental illness. I am not saying that is an excuse but I do understand. She was young and already had three kids before 23. I use to watch them from time to time. She was the most beautiful person I knew to this very day. Yes she had kids at a young age but she was back in school, trying to get your life together. While she was in evening classes, this was mostly when I watched her children. She committed suicide for a selfish reason. For the thought of losing a man was more greater than being with your children. She had attempted suicide one other time that I knew of for that same man. I guess she hope that he would stay. He did for a little while but he left again for another woman. The second time she wasn't so lucky. I still see him around town from time to time.
-15	negative	loss-to-suicide	I lost a friend to suicide. We were on the same soccer team when we were 5. We didn't stay in touch and I didn't hear her name again until I heard her father died. My mom researched it more because she recognized his face and she found out that my friend had committed suicide 6 months before. I wish I had stayed in touch. I wish I could have done something to help her. I miss her. I cried all day when I found out. I don't know why it hurt me so much. My only memory I have with her is at soccer practice when I was wearing a spongebob shirt and she was chasing me around wanting to have my shirt. But you know, I really do miss her
-7	negative	loss-to-suicide	I lost another sibling earlier this year due to suicide. I learned today that my sister had had an abortion only telling one other about it. My family was asking me questions too about what I felt when I saw her being the first to see her after it was done.
-12	negative	loss-to-suicide	I lost David, the love of my life, my soul mate, my dream come true in May of 2012.  It was sudden and unexpected and completely ripped my heart out of my chest.  Someone told me several months ago that Pennies were from Heaven, I really didn't think anything of it until I actually started noticing more and more pennies in my path.  Used to be I would only pick a penny up if it were on Heads, LolChild hood idea.  But now, I look at it this way.  David throws them in my path.  When I find one, I pick it up and look up to Heaven and just smile and sometimes wink.as if to say "I am thinking about you too"  I came home one day to find about 4 pennies scattered on my kitchen floor, which to my knowledge, I had never seen before.  It was kind of cool.  So, now when I find a penny, no matter where I am, it gets picked up and stays with me.  I believe in Pennies from Heavenwithout a doubt.
-2	negative	loss-to-suicide	I lost my 12 year old brother to suicide in March of 2013, I miss him like crazy & wish he was still here. 
-2	negative	loss-to-suicide	I lost my best friend, lover, soul mate. two and a half years ago. and my life has never been the same. She was beautiful, perfect in my eyes, and special in my heart. I miss her everyday. im so lost without her. she was the greatest most fearless leader I will ever have the pleasure of knowing
-19	negative	loss-to-suicide	I lost my brother, by best friend to suicide 8 weeks ago today. The pain has been overwhelming. Not one day goes by without tears flowing from my eyes. Before his death, he hugged me three times and told me that he loved me very much. I knew what he was thinking about because we were that close. He attempted suicide last year, but I found him and called 911 immediately and he survived. This time, I wasn't there for him, I moved out of town. My brother was suffering from severe pain, with a broken back and his diabetes was out of control. He was facing amputation and blindness. His note said that he was tired and his body was tired.
-12	negative	loss-to-suicide	I lost my dad to suicide in 99. I finally have figured out why. I finally understand. He just could not take the pain of the mean cruel people in this world. I will be making my exit soon. Been thinking about it for 6 years. I think it's time. I've heard for years it will get better. That's the biggest lie I've ever heard. So don't say it will get better. I'm so tired. I've served my purpose. It's time to go.
-8	negative	loss-to-suicide	I lost my dog 9 months ago. He was my best friend. Yeah he was silly I know but I loved him so much.I miss my little buddy. Our house is empty without him. I miss him barking and I miss his deep and trusting brown eyes too. I miss his hugs and the silly smile on his face. When I was 11 I went on a excursion with my class. When I came home my mum told me that Feri was staying infront of the door every day,waiting for me to arrive and when finally that happened he was sooo happy,he was jumping and barking , it was soo cute. I loved going outside with him. When I was sad I keep talking to him and I always felt better. When I was happy he was happy too,when I was sad he was sad too. Nine months past and I still miss him terribly. He was special,for me he was perfect. R.I.P my little buddy,I hope you are in a better place.
-10	negative	loss-to-suicide	I lost my Grandpa when I was only one years old, and I don't remember him at all. Right now what kills me the most, is my Grandma was diagnosed with cancer over a year ago, and there is no cure, it gets worse and worse. And I have to live everyday not knowing when she will breath her last breath. I am very close to my grandmother, andit hurts me deeply, and saddens me that I have to sit there as someone that I love is dying at front me, going through that pain and I can not do anything to help her. 
-11	negative	loss-to-suicide	I lost my job shortly after I began transitioning. In fact, I lost my job because they found out that I am transgendered and transitioning. I am no less intelligent, hard working, or a team plaSometimes I think that it wasn't such a bad thing, losing that job. I have never had a job where I had felt such hostility before, and I have worked in the prison system. The only time that I didn't have someone putting me down was when I went out on a call by myself. Our supervisor straight told me that he didn't want to hear it or deal with it. That was the worst environment that I had ever been forced to endure, thank the powers that be that it is over.
-7	negative	loss-to-suicide	I lost my Mom to suicide when I was 16 months old. She was 17. I was told she was murdered. I was told a gun fell from the wall and went off by accident. I was also told that she crawled from the room where she was shot and was found lying over my body. I'm 57 years old and still grieve for her. I have accepted that I will never know what happened. She was shot in the chest. I lost my 21 year old granddaughter to a questionable suicide a few months ago. So the questions begin again. She left a two year old daughter who will grow up in the same wondering darkness that I did. Will the circle never be broken?
-1	negative	loss-to-suicide	I lost my mother to suicide when I was just nine years old. It's been ten years since she's been gone, took her life with pills. I wish I could have gotten to know her better, I wish I wasn't so young and misunderstanding. I was only a child and I could not grasp why she would do such a thing, leaving me and my brother. I thought it was selfish. 
-5	negative	loss-to-suicide	I lost my mum to suicide on the 13/04/2012.. my mum was my bestfriend and losing her has been so hard. Not seeing her everyday like we used too. The pain still hurts in my chest and tears flow most days thinking of her.. miss and love her so very much 
-16	negative	loss-to-suicide	I lost my sister to suicide and although we were pretty close, I can hardly tell what I am feeling right now. I didn't cry much yet, just got angry at first for what she did she didn't thought of us before doing this. Although I'm starting to feel depressed back again, I feel I can get the strength to get over this. I can forgive her for what she did, she must had been in a great suffering and didn't accept any help from anyone. She just wanted to be left alone and was smiling all the time, which is weird for me I just see my friends being more supportive with me and I wonder if I'm dating the right person
-14	negative	loss-to-suicide	I lost my sister to suicide less than a month ago, but I'll tell that story later.   Lastly, if you are having problems, please talk to people.  Even if some people aren't understanding, eventually someone will be, and they can help.  Just keep asking, more people have issues than show on the outside, and most friends will help if they know how.  If you can't bring the courage to talk to someone face to face, contact people online.  I have an open ear to anyone that needs to talk, I would be glad to help a total stranger in any way if it made their life easier or better in some degree.  Please don't give up, the world can be a great place when you know how to enjoy it.  I've been through the verbal and physical abuse, the drug use, the loneliness, the despair, but it gets better
-1	negative	loss-to-suicide	I lost my uncle Booie in 2009 
-9	negative	loss-to-suicide	I lost one of my bestfriends, I knew she was in pain.. We talked so many times I talked her out of it, one night she just did it.. No one was expecting it, it was a blizzard outside.. -40 weather, she took pills and went for a walk, she over dosed. :'(  I miss her so much. I'm so hurt.. I feel like no one will ever understand&lt;/3 I'm so heartbroken.. It's going to be a year on January 11th, I'm going crazy without her, I want her back.. I'd do anything just to have her here with me again. 
-6	negative	loss-to-suicide	I lost one of my best friends to suicide on 23rd of October 2010. We first met in 2004 and instantly became very good friends. We shared some tough life experiences and were both battling depression and self harm. In 2004 we lived abroad together and got to know each other very well. We were great support for each other because we could always sense if something was wrong. Today I still feel the guilt of leaving here there and not beeing there for her.
-4	negative	loss-to-suicide	I lost someone very close to me by suicide , it was my brother in 1998. He was very close to me, I felt and feel very guilty because he came to me and because of my ex-wife I couldn't help him. He left his wife and his 6 yr. old daughter behind. I miss him so much .
-13	negative	loss-to-suicide	I lost the guy who was both my best friend and my boyfriend. He was also the father of (at the time) our unborn son. I lost the brightest person in my life. His smiles were amazing, his laughter; contagious, and his hugs; unforgettable. I will never forget him, and will always love him. He was my anchor, and I was his. We were compatible, almost soul mates. And when he died, I felt like I lost half of my heart. We had been together for 3 years. What really hurts is he texted me before he put that gun to his head He THOUGHT about me CARED enough to tell me one last time Good bye and in his own way that he loved me But the thought of me and how much he cared for me, wasn't enough to stop him. That is the worst feeling I have ever felt, that I wasn't ENOUGH. I hope to God, when our son gets old enough, he doesn't feel what I felt/feeling. That he doesn't blame himself for his dad's death, since it was so close to his birth. 
-6	negative	loss-to-suicide	i lost you and no one told me untill today i loved you and u left you were my best friend              RIP JASON MY BEST FRIEND IN THE WHOLE  WIDE WORLD
-4	negative	loss-to-suicide	I love my husband dearly but sometimes i don't feel like I'm strong enough to take on his PTSD. Some days are good but when there bad there bad!! How do u other spouses cope with living with PTSD? What's your outlet? What are something's u do that help ur spouse?
-4	negative	loss-to-suicide	I'm 14 I have an eating disorder I cut myself oftenI self harm to try and feel better and it works for a while
-18	negative	loss-to-suicide	I'm a 16 year old girl, and I lost my father to suicide back in 2011 on October 20th. It was only 2 weeks after my 15th birthday when my mother received the tragic call. Still to this day, I can hear the exact way she sounded when she heard the news, and it breaks my heart. My emotions are all over the place, and I have blamed myself for his passing because I feel like I wasn't good enough for him to stick around. He was an amazing man, and such a great father & I just wish he would've fought his drug addiction and depression. I am happy 95% of the time and i'm so thankful that this has made me a stronger person, but I need him back. It relieves me to know I have many people to relate to, and know that I'm always here to relate to any of you. Because of this tragic situation, I want to be a psychologist so I could help suicidal or depressed people with their problems.
-6	negative	loss-to-suicide	i'm a particularly emotional person where appropriate. such as is your average adult female. there are ideas that women feel too much or cry  easily etc etc etc but it's all nonsense to me, women simply seem to learn that emotions are okay and thus they accept, feel and express them without excessive shame. i feel badly sometimes for men who are programmed so poorly regarding emotion, having ideas such as "men do not cry" or "do not say they love you" or "do not include intimacy in friendship with other males" etc.. don't cut yourself if you're under 18, i know that's 100% sound advice always.
-5	negative	loss-to-suicide	I'm done. I'm cutting my wrist as much as I want this time and I'm running away. I can't take this anymore. This is too much. I am so done. I'm going to cut. & no one is going to see it cause I'll be gone. All these people are so mean. I can't take it anymore.
-11	negative	loss-to-suicide	I met a girl once while at a mental asylum. She had climbed on the edge of bridge, and just stayed there, looking over the edge. People around started to stare, before finally alerting police of this "jumper". It took ages to get her to come down. She just stayed there, for the better part of the day, contemplating suicide.  I simply drove back home, and let the tears exist my eyes. I had never felt this close to someone before. Countless times I dream of going back, and doing something differently. What I could have done to prevent this from happening. Its all too late now. 
-5	negative	loss-to-suicide	I met him here on this site, I only talked to him a few times but he was a nice guy. I hope you are still alive kiwiman
-6	negative	loss-to-suicide	I'm finally accepting who I am and that I am beautiful. Ladies, there are plenty of men out there who love us and our bodies just the way they are. Never settle for anything less.
-2	negative	loss-to-suicide	 I'll never forget you Oscar buddy. Farewell my dear old friend. I hope that someday we will be together again.
-1	negative	loss-to-suicide	I miss my cat so much. I got her after a friend betrayed my trust and having her in my life ws so theraputic. She was furry and sweet and my buddy. I always cherished the time I could spend with her and I miss her so much.
-1	negative	loss-to-suicide	I miss  my dog who passed away her name is Swetty she is a labrador dog. And I miss her so much. She was died because of  a truck vehicle On October 15, 2010 If I can talk to her right now I just want to say that please comeback to me because I really dont know what to do w/out her. I am always crying every night silently. I miss the time when we are always running going to the sea with my mom and little sister ;( And now Eventhough we have plenty of dogs I will never ever forget you Swetty and you are the best dog in this world.and Eventhough you are  no longer by my side but you are still and forever in my heart. I love you, I miss you and goodbye ;( You never know what you have until you lose it, and once you lose it, you can never get it back. 
-10	negative	loss-to-suicide	I miss you when I don't hear from you in days!  You have become my rock, my best friend, and my biggest supporter. I know we have never met face to face but you always know how to put a big smile on my face.  Even though he threw me away like I was trash you never turned your back on me and I love you for that.  I don;t care what anybody thinks you are a beautiful person on the inside and out.
-1	negative	loss-to-suicide	I'm like an emotional sponge. A little thing can trigger off my anxiety and it feels horrible. I don't hate my life, I just hate me. Sometimes.
-7	negative	loss-to-suicide	I'm no stranger to loss. I've lost things, contacts, or friends. But I have especially experienced a lot of deaths. I've lost most of my closest friends and family over the years. By about a couple of years ago, all my best friends and closest friends from high school had died. (I'm just 33.) All my grandparents are gone, my father, many of my uncles and my closest ones, other good friends and neighbors, my pets, and in this age, some of my closest on line friends have passed away as well. My childhood sweetheart recently passed away. One of my cousins was murdered when she was about 21, we were the same age and had the same first name but were both called by shortened nicknames. My best friend and my cousins wife, who was a mother of six, both died waiting for transplants.
-16	negative	loss-to-suicide	I'm not sure if this is going to help me. I really don't see what can right now. I lost my best friend of 23 years. I met him when I was 17 and he was 21. He was so adorable. I'm sure he would hate for me to describe him that way, but he was. It's strange but we never married. I always felt married in my heart and I think he felt that way too. We have an amazing 21 year old son together.  How I ended up having raised such a wonderful kid is beyond me, because I don't deserve him.      The weight is crushing. It pushes me in on myself and I can't breath. I can't see a way past this pain. Everyone says time will heal all things and maybe it does. But right now all I see is the endless time without him.
-12	negative	loss-to-suicide	I'm seriously tired of hearing people say: "it's no big deal and besides maybe they should have been stronger!" Well you know what? Maybe they were VERY strong, but you tore them all of the way down that that was their only choice because living was hurting them way too much. I can see how people think that it's selfish, cause in a way, it is. Taking such a great, beautiful, and amazing away from this world. Especially family and friends. But see, the thing is If someone is that low They think that life would be better without them. Which isn't true, but people can make them feel like that. So everyone, please Watch what you say and think before you speak. Because they may not be here for you to apologize to tomorrow.
-4	negative	loss-to-suicide	IM SORRY FOR what my brother did  i know it will be hard but i got an email from my brother telling me to help so if you need help in anyway i will do my best 
-5	negative	loss-to-suicide	I'm standing guard what I said of me starting to not liking people. The only living things I like is nature and animals. 
-3	negative	loss-to-suicide	Im the person usually people run to for things, I have no idea why i let people in my life so easy, I just feel like if they say the right things then I can call them my friends, and when I do that I get hurt in the end. I just want someone that is there for me like I'm there for them.
-6	negative	loss-to-suicide	In 2006, I was 10 years old. At the time I was told that my older sister, Abeer had been in a car accident that killed her. She was 24 when she died. Though it was extremely confusing considering the fact that her car was outside in the driveway without a scratch. I didn't question my parent's story seeing as it was not the best time, but I always knew my sister did not die the way I was told she died. The entire family was devastated. Abeer and I weren't close, she was rarely even home so not having her around didn't phase me much. I was sad, of course, but her death didn't affect me as much when I was 10 as it did when I was 12.     Your youngest sister, Shereen.
-13	negative	loss-to-suicide	In 2008 my mom seemed distant from me (1 and my younger brother (. One day in march, she got really upset and went to the bathroom and loaded the gun in front of me. She then took me and my bother to my grandpas and went back home. I told him about the gun and he rushed over. He called the police. Soon he came back with tears in his eyes and took me to my grandmas. A whole group of people were crowding her. I just stood there, I was not prepared for what she told me next "mommy's gone to heaven" I bursts out crying and I didn't eat for weeks. I didn't know how she did it until 2010 when my grandpa got cancer, my cousin told me about my mom. And I rushed to him. It's been 5 years now almost 6 and I will always remember her, I will always miss her, but I will also always remember this memory &lt;3
-4	negative	loss-to-suicide	In 7 hours and 50 minutes it will be fourteen days since I lost my beautiful momma.  I have this ache in my chest. When it's not aching I'm sure it's just a hole, I can feel the wind going right through me. I miss her hugs  and laughter and the blue eyes that both my son and I have, my everlasting reminder. She had such a big heart. It was hurt so badly. But now it's mine that is broken.
-14	negative	loss-to-suicide	In august 2012 my close friend hung himself & I just couldn't believe it. He was always happy with a smile on his face and when I heard that he passed I thought it was a mistake. I guess he was dealing with this that nobody knew about. I took it so hard , I remember the last time I heard his voice it actually was the last time we spoke & he told me that we would always be best friends & that he loved me. I truly miss him. I don't know if I can say that he's in a better place now only because I wish he was here still. But Elvis will always be my angel. He was only 25
-4	negative	loss-to-suicide	In August of 2010, I lost my dear wife. Many people say they have found their soul mate. I truly did in Kimmy. My heart aches for her everyday. 
-6	negative	loss-to-suicide	I need help and I've tried seeking help and it hasn't worked I don't know how to stop I've got to the point where I'm not telling my friends cuz they r getting so worried about it 
-3	negative	loss-to-suicide	I need to put my 16+ year old yellow lab to sleep, should I bring his best buddy, also a 3 year old lab, to the vet with us to be apart of putting him down so he is aware of what's happening, and so he knows why we didn't bring the old one home? or will he understand? Any thoughts on this will be appreciated.I am going to do this Tuesday. Pray I have the strength. I will see all of my animals in heaven. Scott
-3	negative	loss-to-suicide	I never really knew how many people have went through losing their mother from suicide until nowbecause in that moment you feel so alone.  I love you mom. 8/25/2012 &lt;3
-11	negative	loss-to-suicide	I never thought that I would lose her. When my father had passed and I had gone four months of my mother secretly taking alcohol as a daily relief for her mourning of my fathers death. I had turned eleven and at school, I had endured bullying to the point of suicide.  Blabbering that it was all her fault. Next thing I knew, my mother, had committed suicide and I was put into the care of my aunt, which meant that I had to move, I had to move to a place named New Zealand.
-7	negative	loss-to-suicide	In July of 2012, my dad's girlfriend and him had a rough breakup. This lady happened to be my confidant and my best friend. I saw her one night and there was just a depression in the air. As I left she said the line that I'm sure will be etched in my brain for life, "you don't ever have to see me again but just know I love you." I got the call the following evening that she committed suicide. I honestly have never been the same since.
-1	negative	loss-to-suicide	I obsess over finding new way to self harm. Its riveting and unhealthy.
-2	negative	loss-to-suicide	I officially stopped self harming. My mom found out and threatened to put me in an insane asylum..so I didn't wanna risk it. She does full body checks everyday. I'm officially done !(:
-1	negative	loss-to-suicide	I really want to self harm  Please I need a friend so alone
-5	negative	loss-to-suicide	I relapsed last night and I punched the wall so hard my fist is bruised. I've been so triggered to cut lately. I used to do it all up my arm but now I don't have the energy to worry about wearing long sleeves all the time. So now, I just do it in the same one spot on my wrist I can cover with a bracelet. Or my hips, those are safe, no one will see and summer isn't for months.
-17	negative	loss-to-suicide	i remember me waking to find my mom in the kitchen making breakfast so happy like nothing was wrong Then my dad came home. Not that i hated my dad but it was the news a brought that was hurtful My dad never really came home from work until around 6:30-7:00 so this was strange. He told my mom he wanted to talk to her privatly for a moment and she went to there bedroom to talk. My mom came out in tears and her face was red like a tomato. My dad looked as if he would cry too. I asked gently: Mom? Whats wrong? She told all 4 of us that our close cousin Robert Commited suicide over a girlfriend! I felt the tears coming i new that there would be no way of holding them back.. he was only 18 years old! a kid!!!! I then felt warm soft salty tears drip down my face and onto the floor. It has been a year since he died on july 3rd 2012 If you have had an expeirence like this please comment tell me what happen i will understand
-8	negative	loss-to-suicide	I remember, twice in one month two years ago, I saw in the news that two different people committed suicide and said the same thing.  That if just one person had just noticed them that day they would not have done it.  So, ever since then I just randomly smile and wave at every person I see, even when I'm driving, well not every person, but as much as I can.  
-11	negative	loss-to-suicide	I rescued a kitten from the bushes in my neighbor's yard some 7 years ago.  A pure white kitten with aqua blue eyes; I kept her and named her Angel.  She was so perfect.  She responded to her name, she cuddled and played, she liked the indoors and outdoors.  Her only flaw was once bringing a bird heart into my room (she was a good hunter lol).  One day (coincidentally after a creepy person moved in next door o. she went outside, and stayed outside for 6 days.  Time passed, week after week, month after month and I longed to see her just once more.  To at least know if she was alive.  She will be 7 in April and it's been about 3 years since I last saw her.  I would give so much to see my precious cat again.  I miss her so much!
-6	negative	loss-to-suicide	I see a lot of hokey stories on here , sounds like half of them are just people who have nothing better to do then sit around and complain, i can say that because i use to be one of those people.  Traci 
-4	negative	loss-to-suicide	I self harm. No two ways about it. I've done it for months now. No one knows, no one notices, no one cares. Not my "friends" not my family, not my teachers. No one. I have done it on my thighs. And my left arm, although I haven't done it for about 2 weeks now I get urges every single day. I want this all to be over.
-19	negative	loss-to-suicide	Isn't it funny how we can tell how a person is feeling by looking into their eyes? It's like we can tell by the squinting and the widening of the eye. Or just the dilation of the pupil can say how we are feeling when our own voices have shut us up. It almost seems like our own eyes scream louder than our own voices. Our eyes can sometimes be like our own demons and it seems like when the demon becomes stronger, that is when you have lost all control. But one thing i know that i am positive of, is when you close your eyes, that is when you know you have had enough.
-1	negative	loss-to-suicide	I sometimes think about committing suicide but I know that I can't leave my two best friends behind..
-11	negative	loss-to-suicide	I started about 6 months ago, a 'friend' told me and taught me how to do it. I did it once a week maybe for about a month but then some girls at my school noticed, they'd laugh at me and call me depressed and silly names. It was at this point where self harm was daily for me, for about 12 weeks I would self harm everyday, then I was clean, I didn't self harm for a whole month, but recently from the start of December I've started doing it again, I mainly slash my wrists of my stomach area. Do I need help?!
-2	negative	loss-to-suicide	I started cutting at age 10. Even by then i'd been through so much, but, that rush that release from cutting filled my mind with euphoria. 
-6	negative	loss-to-suicide	I started self harming in 6th grade - my first year of middle school. I count myself lucky because I've never really been bullied My self harm stemmed from self-hate, anxiety, depression, parental issues etc. It started with harsh snaps on my wrist and thighs with thick hair elastics, digging my nails into my skin, lip-biting, etc. As my self harm escalated I started to take apart my razors. I started with small cuts and then gradually got deeper This went on until halfway through year 8.  Thank you for taking the time to read my story 
-10	negative	loss-to-suicide	I started to self-harm when I was 10 years old. I started cutting and hitting my head repeatedly on objects at school like the desk the walls ect  I continued cutting until I was 15 I remember the words I cut into my arms all the scars lining both my legs. The bruises on my back from giving myself the belt. I couldn't escape the pain I loved it so much, that rush, the taste on my fresh blood as it poured from my arms. I stopped almost 3 years ago because I thought I didn't need it. But today that changed i started beating myself up again literally giving myself the belt, punching myself in the jaw and elbowing my legs. I have alternative to cutting where I just gently run the blade over my skin. I tried so hard to stop but I realize I need the pain and I need to be the cause. 
-1	negative	loss-to-suicide	I still miss my dog even though he passed away back in 2009.  He was part of the family for over 14 years.  My daughter grew up with him, we took him camping, my nephews played with him, he was mischief and got in trouble regularly, he was smart but pretended to be dumb, he taught me why the saying exists "men are dogs" (ha ha I just had to throw that one in there but uhm yeah, we can look at the similarities and surmise there is truth in that statement!)  My dog would tuck me in at night by giving me a kiss goodnight.  He was my first dog and I will always love and miss him!  
-7	negative	loss-to-suicide	I stopped for the most part, getting all the help that i need. But one of the reasons i decided to quit was because i was getting older and i was wanted to do things like donate blood, but i couldn't with nasty cuts all over my arms, or so that going to the doctor wouldn't be so awkward. Thanks for reading.
-4	negative	loss-to-suicide	It brings me pleasure . Seeing the blood run down my arms and drip on the floor releases all the Anger and sadness for a split second . I am not ashamed of my scars nor am I proud of them but they remind me what I have made it through and that the pain goes away &lt;3
-4	negative	loss-to-suicide	It burns and stings but I honestly don't care. I did it with a knife repeatedly until I drew blood and started feeling better about myself. The only problem is that I don't feel better. I feel worse because I haven't cut myself in three years and am so ashamed that I broke my streak. I thought I was over this but obviously I'm not
-2	negative	loss-to-suicide	I tend to put myself in a place of responsibility, so it is really easy for me to feel like Im to blame for everything that goes wrong. If Im in charge, its my fault because Im in charge. If Im not, its my fault because I didnt do anything about it. Its always my fault.
-7	negative	loss-to-suicide	It happened in November many years ago.. I found out by seeing his death notice in the morning paper what a shock,,,, he went crazy at the end and took his dad's gun and literally blew his brains out while home alone! his mom came home and found him half alive on the living room couch, I will spare the gory details.. just terrible.. It messed me up for a few years mentally because i wish i had been able to help him before this happened!    
-3	negative	loss-to-suicide	It has been four years since I last saw my grandma. Except for that one time, last summer, when I saw her in my dreams that she was brought back to life. -have a little faith by Mitch Albom
-12	negative	loss-to-suicide	It has been just under 2 years since my oldest brother died, March 2 of 2012. He left us a very long suicide note, filled with beauty and positivity and a bit of peace mixed in with his deep pain. I try to hide how much his suicide has devastated me. We were a family of 6 kids and now there is just 5. Although life goes on no matter what, it is like we are all working on autopilot. To put it lightly, his death has certainly taken the wind from my sails. I am just now admitting that I have depression myself and am seeking help. He was my hero, my favourite person and he was only 24. 19 years old is too young to have part of you die. On the two year anniversary I will visit his grave and revel in his first love, music. Jungleland by Bruce Springsteen was our shared favourite song, and it fills me with pain and joy when I listen to it. 
-2	negative	loss-to-suicide	I think if people were "actually" willing to work they would do anything. There are enough jobs but people don't want to do them. For example, care jobs are ten to the dozen. Ok the hours are not great but the money is ok and it will change the way you think about things when you see the lives some people have been given. Your life is really very good by comparison. 
-5	negative	loss-to-suicide	I think I have bi-polar . . . I said it to my mum and my counsellor both on separate occasions and they both seem to agree and both been thinking it for a while. I am not going to lie I am scared. I am going to the doctors in 2 hours and feeling very distressed 
-13	negative	loss-to-suicide	I think the hardest part of living each day is not knowing a true answer to why my son passed away. He was always such a healthy baby at each appt, always moving around. We enjoyed seeing him on 3D/4D and got an amazing video of him. Living each and every day with the thought that my body failed me, is killing me. I truly believe that they let me go to long and my son was to big for my body. He weighed in at a big 10lbs 2 oz and 22in long. Each day I went for an appt in the last 4 weeks they would say next week they will induce you and than just kept putting it off. I blame the doctors a lot for this and that I didn't get to see the same doctor each week. We have been waiting over 4 months now for autopsy results that were done on 6/11/13 when he passed. We just feel there must not be anything to find and that they will probably come back unconvulsive. 
-6	negative	loss-to-suicide	I thought I could write about this, but it is still too raw. This is my third start on this story and I know I won't get any further. I have too much sadness and yes, guilt, to get it out without dissolving onto my keyboard.  I still love you. Why did you have to leave that way?
-5	negative	loss-to-suicide	It hurts so muchloosing people to suicide is so hurtful and confusing all I want to do is scream "why!"he was only 16 years oldhe decided to jump in front of a train 2 weeks agohe was the middle child and I used to babysit all of the kids when they were in grade schoolwe are all hurting right nowtoday is the memorial serviceim so angry inside.
-3	negative	loss-to-suicide	I told myself if I didn't do anything I could cut at midnight on New Year's Eve. I celebrate 2014 with 2,014 cuts across the thigh, euphoric if you ask me.
-3	negative	loss-to-suicide	I took a trip to Maryland to visit my in-laws for the first time. I was extremely nervous but I knew it was important for my husband that we did this.  I have to take it one day at a time. Some days I'm sad and guilty that I couldn't have a good relationship with my in-laws, but most of all I have a lot of anger. Anger with them but anger with myself that I couldn't stand up for me and I let them be so awful to me. I am thankful that I have my family and of course, my wonderful husband who has stood by my side and gave up his family for our relationship. (He no longer speaks to them) Please feel free to comment if bullying is why you have PTSD. 
-11	negative	loss-to-suicide	It's been 10 years since my boyfriend died. We'd had a massive fight and he told me what ever happens will be on my conscience and handed me a bullet. I always regret falling asleep and missing his final call as I could have stopped it or at least told him that I loved him one last time. When  I woke up I listened to his voice message and heard the gun go off. To this day I can still hear that sound. People say that the pain goes away but I still feel it every day and as much as I try to continue and live it just feel like such an empty life. 
-13	negative	loss-to-suicide	it's been 16 years since my brother committed suicide I believe that my late brother hasn't left me completely, he's my guardian angel. One winter I was driving and someone told me "go straight" so I did. As I was driving my vehicle went sideways - I started crying because I noticed the trucks behind me were gone, they decided to drive up the hill before I went sideways.
-3	negative	loss-to-suicide	It's Been 4 Years since you've been gone and i gotta say that i miss you with all my heart. i don't know why you did it but i'll try to understand your pain. can i tell you something.counseling doesn't help even though most people say it will it doesn't i just can't get the fact out of my head you're gone forever and there's nothing i can do sometimes i hate myself for it 
-12	negative	loss-to-suicide	It's been about a year and a half since my husband attempted suicide. I stayed the night with my brother because my husband and I were thinking about separating. I came home and told him that I would stay if he wanted to work on our marriage, and he told me to go. I laid on the couch at my brother's apartment, unable to sleep. At about six in the morning I couldn't take it anymore. I needed my husband to know that I loved him. My head and heart were screaming that I needed to talk to him. I don't want to forget what I went through though. My husband just feels guilty when I talk to him about it, but sometimes I just need to talk about it. I need to go back through those feelings and scenes. I don't understand it, it just is.
-9	negative	loss-to-suicide	It's been almost 7 months since losing my husband in a very unexpected helicopter crash, and I believe I entered a new realm of grief a few weeks ago. Last week was my 39th B-day, and unfortunately I got married on the B-day. Didn't see this coming when I picked the date. I'm spending my weekends searching the saddest songs written. Burning CD's that actually say, top 10 widow picksmy husband was the most, interesting, man alive. He was a prince. If men were money, I  won the lottery, and now I'm bankruptwtf
-6	negative	loss-to-suicide	Its been years since my brother has passed, i started an english lit class recently and figured id test out my poetry skills. This is my first poem ever. Hope you like it   But I will find a way and cope
-1	negative	loss-to-suicide	It's Christmas, and what am I doing? Carving up my body.
-10	negative	loss-to-suicide	It's endemic in this area! If you've ever been to Europe, you'll know old towns are full of tight bends and narrow streets. There you go round a corner and what do you see in your path? A car some idiot decided to park where it is not safe and not permitted!I can understand a badly parked delivery van. If you've got a tight schedule and deliver things for a living, carrying heavy stuff from the parking lot may not be a pleasant thing to do. Work is work. But there's no excuse for other cases. Especially when a lazily parked car will slow down or stop emergency vehicles.
-9	negative	loss-to-suicide	It's his birthday again. Last year at this time I remember our feast at home, celebrating his 67th and last birthday. Now that he's been gone for 11 months. When I was in my room surfing the net I heard my grandma playing the Happy Birthday song on the piano. I was astonished. She never remembers her own birthday when she remembers her husband's. Sorrow in my heart Grandpa is my most beloved relative and he brought me up, and I just want him to come back. :-(
-7	negative	loss-to-suicide	It's not like I cut because I like pain. I don't like pain. I don't know why but I like to watch blood trickle down my forearm. red lines. never been too deep. when I think I can't handle pain, I stop. I was clean for a few months before I started to cut again. I was so frustrated so I cut. just to see my skin opening up. sometimes I couldn't control myself but I never went too far. the itchy feeling from the wounds when they are healing. the more I try to hold back from scratching them, the more excited I get. 
-5	negative	loss-to-suicide	It takes time for the wounds to be covered. Loss of a dear loved one causes so much of pain. Someone who has always cared for you and was willing to go all the way so that you will be happy. Time only passes but the does not healTime only takes away the momentary loss but the loss returns, as always.
-1	negative	loss-to-suicide	It was a shock, to say the least. I hope you've found your peace, Dad. xo
-16	negative	loss-to-suicide	It was August 2000, I am 5 and I was staying a week at my aunties house with her husband and my cousin. I was sick with the flu and was only starting to feel a litte better, My uncle had gone off to work for the day and my cousin was at pre primary neither would be home until at least 6pm due to my cousin's gymnastics. The house was in the middle of nowhere and the nearest neighbour was about 10 km away down the road. For the past week my aunty had made me breakfast like such things as french toast and pancakes this one morning i woke up to no smell it was silence.That was the end..My cousin is within Mental Health care hospital and has never been givenher letter, she is 20. I am constantly having my mental status checked. My life will never be the same, my fear of enclosed spaces doesnt grow weaker. I'm still waiting for my sign.
-18	negative	loss-to-suicide	It was middle school 6th grade when I met him and 8th grade when we started dating. Becoming a senior in high school is when I lost him forever. He was on his way to pick me up then it happen, he was hit by a semi truck. The next two years I spiraled out of control then finally put myself together last year. I've actually met someone almost exactly like him except the way he looks. And the weird thing it's the date we got together is the same date as my first lover. I've been questioning myself if I should move on and I'm almost sure it's time. I'm ready. I left a lot of detail out but I needed to get this of my chest.
-7	negative	loss-to-suicide	It was never planned. My friends look at me and think I'm perfectly stable and happy, but they have no idea what goes on in my head. I have self harmed everyday for over 6 months now. I can't even tell anyone anymore because they call me stupid. They don't understand what it's like being abused as a child and being blamed for it and not believed. Does anyone have similar experiences.. Please share. I want to know that I am not alone.
-9	negative	loss-to-suicide	It was October 16th. My 29th birthday. I hadn't spoken to my cousin for a couple days which wasn't unusual for him. Although he was upset from a bad fight he and his gf had the previous Sat night which happened to be the last time we ever talked. The year before my mother almost died for the second time, when she shattered her knee cap and snapped her femur in two. I wish I was there for him as he needed someone and I wish I wasn't so busy that Saturday before he died, maybe he would still be alive now. 
-8	negative	loss-to-suicide	It will be a year ago on November 14 that I lost my little brother. I'll never know why and it haunts me everyday. I will never let go of the nagging feeling that I could have prevented it. Maybe if I had spent more time with him, maybe if I had opened up to him more, maybe if I had loved him better. Every day I miss him and mourn over the fact that he will never grow up, get married, have kids, be happy. I can only hope that I'll see him again someday.
-10	negative	loss-to-suicide	I unfortunately underestimated a liar. This liar swore that everything that came out of his mouth was the truth and I let him go on without stopping him. I brought this person into my life thinking that he would be a good friend. Now I'm dealing with the consequences. So my advice is cut them out of your life before it escalates like my situation did. I not only lost a good friend but I am also emotionally drained because of this person.
-2	negative	loss-to-suicide	I used to cut. You scare me.
-6	negative	loss-to-suicide	I used to cut habitually. I'm so ashamed of my scars because I want to work with youth and feel like that might influence them in unhealthy ways. When I tan in the summer they turn dark and are very visible. Yet I cannot help but be proud that these scars show I have come so far from rock bottom even though things are hard.
-1	negative	loss-to-suicide	I used to say that you can't miss something you never had. 
-5	negative	loss-to-suicide	I used to self harm, sometimes I still have urges. It's not something to joke about, it's a serious thing. If anyone self harms just know, that I love you, and you are a strong person.
-1	negative	loss-to-suicide	I've already shared some stories here. 
-5	negative	loss-to-suicide	I've always blamed myself for everything. Especially my brother and friends raping me for 6 years straight. And, my ex boyfriend killing himself, I already knew that was my fault because I worried him so much with my issues. These things eat at me constantly because they're my fault. I've always blamed myself.
-4	negative	loss-to-suicide	I've always had friends who were suicidal but at least I knew and I was able to help them. I've always been suicidal but this just made things worse. My friend Thabian killed himself on the 28th of October. I love you, Thabian and I wish I would've known I wish you were still here 
-6	negative	loss-to-suicide	i've been fighting this for weeks now and it's getting harder and harder. i'm literally on the edge..cutting was my way out,it was my way of dealing with things,it helped me so much and now.. they took it from me and i have nothing. it's like i don't exist. they took the main part of me and i can't find myself anymore. the urge is harder to deal with it and i. i can't do it,i need to cut. i need to find myself again.
-3	negative	loss-to-suicide	I've been self harming for almost a year now, it started February 1st, 2013. I'm now trying to recover, though I don't think I'll get very far. I'm also suicidal, though I've never attempted-I've wanted to many times.
-1	negative	loss-to-suicide	I've been sober from that addiction for 3 years now. And I want to relapse. I am so stressed out.
-1	negative	loss-to-suicide	I've cut for almost 4 years
-2	negative	loss-to-suicide	I've had my battle and I've had my wars. But now I have many scars.  I dread seeing them
-8	negative	loss-to-suicide	ive heard about many kids in my school suicide many of them had friends and family they were great at many things but in the end it was there choice in the end it will be my choice and i know people will be in pain but i want them to be happy i cant be happy cuz i have very little emotions i cant love but i can care i also want to save someone before i 
-7	negative	loss-to-suicide	I've learned that people have a very limited ability to stomach the reality of suicide. When I attempted it, I didn't just scratch my arm with a butter knife; I grabbed a box cutter and sliced myself up until the blade went dull, then I took it out and put in a clean one.  Unfortunately, the only cure for ignorance is experience. Until every moron out there is forced to see a member of their family being stitched back together in an emergency room by a nurse who is fighting back tears, people will never understand it. I'm not sure it is necessarily fair to expect them to. After all, when you are forced to confront the reality that you, too, can be driven to commit such an act of violence against yourself, the very foundation of your being is shaken. I'm not sure we'd be better off as a society of everyone was forced to go through such a thing.
-28	negative	loss-to-suicide	Ive lost almost three people to suicide. My dad almost died when I was in 6th grade, he hung himself in the garage but my mother found him on time. I came home from my friends house and saw that my moms car was gone. I went to knock on the door but no one answered. I went to my friends dads car and told him my parents didnt answer. I started freaking out, my dad used to drink alot. He was really horrible when he was drunk, so i thought he took her or something. Anywho, i went through the back door and noticed that no one was home. So I called my mom, my friends dad was with me at this moment, and she told me my dad was in the hospital. For three days I stayed at my friends house, not knowing anything. I only found out that he tried to kill himself a few years ago. Now my dad is better, and he doesnt drink that much. Well not to a point to where he is mean. I hope he never does that again. And i hope the pain that he caused goes away one day.
-19	negative	loss-to-suicide	I've lost many people I love in my life, both family and friends. The pain never goes away you just learn to live with the emptiness their absence leaves in your heart. Some you can at least say they lived a long and good lifebut for some that is just not the case. In Jan he was in a terrible accident, we didn't know if he'd even survive. But he improved, slowly day by day there was improvement. We rejoiced that in March he was still with us for his 21st birthday. He still had such a long and hard road ahead of him. Then toward the end of April, God decided Zach had fought long enough and He took my precious cousin home. I was able to make the trip to the funeral, the one and only time I ever saw that handsome face other than pictures, and it was a wonderful full military service. For me the loss is something I will never get over, I have moved on, (still shedding many tears almost daily though) but the place in my heart that Zachary claimed will forever be empty. 
-10	negative	loss-to-suicide	Ive never been close to my biological mother.  My aunt filled that place in my heart.  After years of health problems, she passed away earlier this year.  The one person, who really knew me (because we had shared such similar lives) and still loved me in spite of it all, was gone.  I felt like my world just dropped out from beneath me.  It is so comforting to have that warm embrace you know will always be waiting for you, no matter what.  Losing that affected me much more than I ever realized it might. This is her last gift to me.  I intend to let it not be wasted.
-1	negative	loss-to-suicide	I've overdosed more than five times this year, the most recent one was actually only a few days ago.  I don't exactly want to stop, but my friends are worried. 
-6	negative	loss-to-suicide	I was 18 when I voluntarily admitted myself to a mental hospital recommended to me by my psychologist. It was a time of pain and depression in my life, and I had no where else to really go.  Only three years ago, I couldn't imagine life without her, but I'm living it right now. I am no longer depressed. I have learned to be happy over the years, and i am always sad for my friend. Its a paradox of emotions that can only truly happen once someone loses someone they loved beyond reasoning. You live happily for your deceased loved ones, and you cry for them all the same. 
-15	negative	loss-to-suicide	I was 9 when my Uncle shot himself. We were always really close. He was my godparent and every Sunday afternoon he'd take me out to get ice cream and to the zoo. He always seemed so happy and full of life, but having been so close to him I knew how desperate he really felt. When he died he left me a note. My Aunt was mad at me because she hadn't gotten a note and my family found it weird that I had revieved one but I didn't care because I was so proud that he wrote me one. On it he said 'Sunday ice-creams and the zoo with my little girl. Probably the only thing that kept me going for so long. Stay precious, I love you.' I keep the note with me at all times and it always makes me cry.
-7	negative	loss-to-suicide	I was in a meeting at Quest Diagnostics(where I was working as a cytoprep technician at the time) and I watched one of my co-workers cry over another co-worker being let go.But not even that could have prepared me for the news that awaited me when I got home that day.My now widowed father gathered me and my siblings to tell us that Shawn had commited suicide.Talk about getting caught off-guard.
-4	negative	loss-to-suicide	I was never happy with you in my grown up days foroften you will take sides ad I didnt feel you did me right sometimes though I knew you had to do t for protecting your interest. But I never could accept it at the cost of me. However, you would give me a sense of conection to my past and the regulr calls would be somthing I got used to. I have to be strong and I have to try not to let down any one else and so I pray for courage to bear on.
-8	negative	loss-to-suicide	I was raised by my single mom in a poor area surrounded by other families headed by single mothers. This is where I met my friend Michael and his mother. Michael was sweet, shy, caring, playful, bright, energetic and creative. When I was 10 and he was 9 we often hung out together. We used to have contests to see who could hand stand the longest, who could walk on their hands the furthest, we even dared one another to try back flipping lol. We would talk for hours about our moms, our missing dads, our hopes and dreams, our fears, and our mutual love  and longing for summer ( we are Canadian lol). 
-8	negative	loss-to-suicide	I was so close being bankruptcy. I had trouble trying to find a job in my trade so I been living off a credit card so I can live. Sometimes living off gov't money . I was so close losing everything as I almost was not able to make those credit card payments. Finally I found a job in my trade in summer 2011 that pays well.   To date, I now owe $19,000.  Maybe you can get as lucky as me. But but do me a favor if you do get debt consolidation, try not to get into new debt that you don't need. I take it a step further. I take advantage of the rewards programs that haves no fees. I put my living expenses on those card and pay it off right way to get free stuff and pay no interest 
-8	negative	loss-to-suicide	I was verbally abused by peers and teachers all through elementary and in 7th grade I had enough. I told only one person that I was going to kill myself but that one person saved my life. She was scared for me so she told the school counsuler. Today I suffer from the things they said. I have depression, anxiety, and aggressiveness towards people who didn't do anything wrong including children. Life is hard emotionally still but I just need to stay positive.
-1	negative	loss-to-suicide	I wear my heart on my sleeve. Every cut, every time I needed to get all the pain inside of me out, it was all on my arm. I couldn't help it, it was what the heart wanted
-15	negative	loss-to-suicide	I went to stay at a newly-renovated hotel in Jacksonville Beach, FL with a few friends for a 'girl's nite out', and as I was sitting in a chair in the room, a penny literally dropped onto the floor from the middle/bottom of my chair.  All of us were freaked out as to where it could have come fromor howor why.  And an hour later, while walking on the beach, I found a penny in a pile of seashells that had coral deposits growing on it.   And then another random penny.etc  To this day, when we all meet (2 x a yr.), we always wonder, 'what was up with the crazy pennies'.   (Sometimes when we get together we go 'ghost hunting'.  We think that the souls in the old hotel knew we were 'tuned in'.)   We were.   
-1	negative	loss-to-suicide	I will explain what happened to my mom in another post some time it is too long and complicated and will take me awhile to explain what happened, and I am dealing with my one year old daughter right nowbut my question is does everyone in a family start to get odd or something when the one year mark comes up of a person committing suicide?  Everyone in my family is acting odd:-(  My mom committed suicide on August 27, 2012 and its coming up soon and everyone is just being odd and I don't like it.  Just wish my family was there for one another.  We are drifting more and more apart since she has been gone. I wish my mom was here I'm lost without her. 
-4	negative	loss-to-suicide	I wondered if I would ever be writing my experience in here. I will be removing this story in the due time - which I hope will be within a few weeks at least.

-2	negative	loss-to-suicide	I wrote this poem yesterday. I might ask to read it at my grandfathers funeral. Goodbye
-2	negative	loss-to-suicide	John was my older brother by six years. I can only say this. Suicide is the worst way of trying to resolve an upset. You only create more upset. And if you are romantically involved with someone, do please be honest. The relationship might not mean that much to you, but it might mean everything to the other person.
-1	negative	loss-to-suicide	Just gone bald-LUV it, great!!!
-5	negative	loss-to-suicide	Just to difficult. She is the girl I share my soul with, I saved her several times, even with my bare hands when it happened right in front of my eyes, but I accepted, knew her reasons, understood her reasons, I don't blame her at all, but I blame me for not following her, but as long as my mother is here I'm not strong enough to leave. Bo, my most beautiful journey I had with you, I felt so alive, you looked up to me, at the same time I was looking up to you, now I'm the only one who is still able to look up, I thank my life because of you, I really do, and I'll keep that promise but just like everything else, I'll have to delay it, till the time comes.

-1	negative	loss-to-suicide	Last year I meet a girl named Alesha. WILL SOMEONE HELP ME! PLEASE! I cant lose her shes like my sister! 
-4	negative	loss-to-suicide	Last year I spent a week with my brother, while my mother was in the hospital. It was kind of a weird time. We hadn't really gotten along in a long time.  My mother was so sick the Drs wouldn't let me tell her until almost 2 weeks later. 
-2	negative	loss-to-suicide	Last year my best friend committed suicide, she was beautiful and the one person who was truly there for me 24/7  I miss you so much, Kathryn you were such a great person and I'm happy as long as you are happy &lt;3 you gorgeous x
-5	negative	loss-to-suicide	Lost my uncle 16 years ago this January to suicide. He was such a hilarious guy. Still can't believe he's gone.  I wish I could go back in time and help him, but I can't. All we have are memories of his contagious laugh, his funny observations, and his warm personality. He was a great guy. I love you, UJ.
-4	negative	loss-to-suicide	Material losses come and go and are only significant when there is an emotional component such as a picture.      Even with the losses, I am still standing and continuing forward one step at a time.   It just goes to show that your world can fall and collapse, but with a will you can stand out of the ashes.
-20	negative	loss-to-suicide	Me and my brother are 4 years apart, we weren't always the best of friends but I always looked up to him.  He was a great friend, always so full of lifeI'm not sure what happend. Just days after my brothers birthday he hung himself. He had a family, a job, friends, and no signs of depression. But when my brother drank it was a different story. 08/04/13 was one of those nights, he had been drinking and celebrating is birthday. He walked to the park and hung himself by a swing. I try so hard to understand what he was going through but its so hard. This will be our first holiday with out him and I'm trying to be strong, Thanksgiving just passed and it wasnt the same it was so hard to be thankful when a huge part of my life was missing, I have a million feelings but I constantly have to stay strong because I have a family of my own who needs me. I wish you were still here big bro!! 
-3	negative	loss-to-suicide	Michael had a lot of problems from the time he was little.  In kindergarten he got mad at the teacher for telling him he had to put away the blocks, well Michael kicked the teacher in the leg.  His anger was always a problem.  He got sent home that day. 
-6	negative	loss-to-suicide	More than the pain, the appearance of a wound on me (my wrist, neck, abdomen) is extremely calming. I like the look of my scars. I don't have a clear reason as to 'why'. I don't cover them. I'm not seeking attention, I think when people see the marks, they avoid me. I like the affect they have people. I've cut, scratched, bitten, and even choked myself (the one thing I wasn't fond of). I bruise myself sometimes, simply because I enjoy the look of my bruises. Is there a name for this (other than masochism)? (There's always a name for these things.) 
-16	negative	loss-to-suicide	My 89 year old father passed away on the 6th of September..I can not think of him without tears forming in my eyes.. I loved him so much, he was a wonderful husband to my mother and father to my brothers and I. I feel blessed that we had him with us this long. Anyway, my mother use to tell us the story that she used to work in a drive in restaurant in the 40's as a "carhop" My dad who was in the Navy stopped by and left her a penny tip. He later would tell us that was all he had. I talked to my mother this evening, she is very distraught with missing him. She said that he has come by to see her. He has turned the light on next to her chair when she comes in the house after being away. Today, she found a penny in her bed..Truly, a penny from Heaven for my mother, from the man she loved for 67 years. thank you God for your blessings and for my father's unending love.
-2	negative	loss-to-suicide	My best friend in Australia, in the Northern Territory, is part-Native Australian, and she is a wonder to me. I don't go a week without talking with her somehow. Samuel was frustrated with his existence, even in the tribal grounds, and was confused about where he belonged. He would get into fights, especially with the police, and when I was seventeen, he was hounded by them, and hung himself using his trousers while in a police cell.
-8	negative	loss-to-suicide	My best friend Ryan committed suicide 2 weeks ago yesterday. He's always been depressed  and talked about it endlessly so I can't say it was a huge shock but it still hit me pretty hard..I'd never been to a funeral or even seen a corpse before and I had to be one of the pall bearers and give his eulogy..We also worked together so it's been tough not seeing him. He was a good man who always put everyone else ahead of himselfI was sad at first..then angryat him and myself for not being able to do anythingI know he was in a lot of pain and I'm hoping now wherever he is, or isn't, he's at peace. I'll miss you Rye guy.
-6	negative	loss-to-suicide	My best friend's brother Samuel killed himself in police custody. He had been arrested because being a Native Australian he could be riotous, he let off steam a lot.  Just as Azu took her time getting over it so did I. I loved him, and although we were never lovers I am sure our intimacy could have led us to that if there had been more time.
-2	negative	loss-to-suicide	My best friend shot herself in the chest several months ago.  I know there's no way it was my fault but I still struggle with thoughts like "Why wasn't I there?" or "Why didn't she call me?" I could have helped her, and I would have. I thought she knew that.
-6	negative	loss-to-suicide	My best friend we were both in 8th grade She was beautiful, but she got bullied by not just girls guys. She was called fat and she was called ugly I tried to protect her but then she got a facebook by the time I realized what was happening on facebook, it was to late I ran to her house after reading a message she sent to my friend, and I ran into the house, her parents were out of town I yelled her name over and over, and I searched every room but I couldn't find her, then I ran into the barn in the middle of the barn she shot herself she wrote, She was my rock the only person that I could truly talk to and she understood what I was going through, and I understood what she was going through. We were both abused badly and we were beat often She was only 13 and to this day I still think about her, and how I should have seen what was happening im the worst person in the world

-3	negative	loss-to-suicide	My boyfriend recently took my blades and I've been alright I guess but I just got brand new razors and I opened them and got the blades and I don't think I can't stop myself from cutting
-1	negative	loss-to-suicide	My brother committed suicide four days ago. He was twenty seven years old and was a graduate student. I don't know what to do; he was always a father type figure to both me and my sister since we were ten and twelve years apart from him respectively. He promised to take us to so many places and do so many things, but he's gone now. Also before thistragedyhappened, I hadn't seen him or talked to him in three months. I don't know how to deal with this right now. He was supposed to help me through these times when my mother and father passed away but I don't know who's going to help me now since my parents are bothtrain wrecks,
-6	negative	loss-to-suicide	My brother had one friend through the thick and thin, his best friend, over the years I got to know him a little, and he seemed to be fine. When I got the call from my family, it was shocking, devastating, and no words can say how this is. Good luck on the rest of your travels,you will be united with God soon, and bless your soul.
-6	negative	loss-to-suicide	My brotherI love you and hate you with equal measure. It will be a year since you decided to leave us and each day we get closer to the anniversary it scares me. My insides are such a mess. I can cry for days from how much I miss you and scream at you for the pain you put so many throughWhy didn't you let me help you? Everyday it feels like a piece of my heart is missingbut that's okit was your part to take.
-4	negative	loss-to-suicide	My brother killed his self 10 years ago they say it gets easier but to be honest it doesn't, you've just got to stay strong. When you lose someone its never gonna be easy!. If you lose someone to suicide just don't blame yourself, remember them for who they were and stay strong, lead a happy life for them and yourself .
-16	negative	loss-to-suicide	My brother took his life on November 17,2012. I still cannot comprehend what has happened. I keep saying to myself, "is this real, is he really gone?". My brother had an illness, bipolar disorder, he was diagnosed at a very young age. Even with this illness my brother accomplished so much in his life. He was such a dedicated person to all he did and believed in. He was a protector, for his family, friends, and people in need. There is such a stigma attached with suicide and this is just one of the problems I am having. I am from such a small town and people talk, even though they really have no idea about the truth, it is all just their own speculation. I made a promise to my brother after he passed and I told him, " for as long as I live I will protect him and who he was". I will dedicate myself to my work, just the way he did to his martial arts and his profession in security services. 
-5	negative	loss-to-suicide	My brother was my everything, my favorite person on earth. Due to an unknown reason, he stopped talking to my family and I and moved away 2 years ago. My family was closer than most, but now a piece is missing from all of us. My goals, my morals.. all have changed since his absence. He could be living across the world,famous, dead, and we wouldn't know.
-17	negative	loss-to-suicide	My cat has been a perfectly healthy 3 year old and then out of the blue in the middle of the night he suffered a blood clot from the heart leaving him yowling and vomiting in pain and distress. I rushed him to the emergency vet and they wanted to put him down straightaway but the shock for me was too much and I begged them to keep him alive. he suffered from a horrible condition called Aortorial thromboemlism which is the first sign of heart disease. Against the odds Coco pulled through this but the terrible realism is that he is likely to have another one. He is also not the same cat. he lack energy , he used to love food and now seems disinterested. I am heart broken as every day I try and prepare myself for the fact he may die. I have felt quite down and miserable ever since I happened, as I loved and still love my cat but I am trying to emotionally prepare myself.  Has anyone else had a cat that survived this ATE thing?
-14	negative	loss-to-suicide	My cousin Charlie just passed away. I'm having a really hard time. He was a great, funny, amazing guy. He was only 18. He didn't deserve to pass that way. I basically grew up with him. Ever since we were little Charlie always had a nickname for me. "Hey Little Rainy." His voice still in my head. The times and memories we shared play through my head. As soon as i get close to forgetting about what happened it comes right back. To think my life couldn't hate me anymore than it didnow i have to live without my cousin &lt;3.   R.I.P. Charlie &lt;3 I love you &lt;3
-2	negative	loss-to-suicide	My cousin (Chris, sometimes known affectionately as Chrissy) decided one dayto take his own life.
-4	negative	loss-to-suicide	My cousin got in a car accident in 2000 which left him paralyzed. By January 2010, he was having issues. Both legs were amputated then bed soreshe lost the battle. He was 28.  Worst year of my life.
-3	negative	loss-to-suicide	My dad committed suicide 18 yrs ago when I was 5. I remember him taking me to the park and that we had fun but I still feel really angry and abandoned. Because of my subsided aching due to his absence, I've craved love since middle school and found myself in an emotionally and a mild physically abusive relationship. Thankfully, I'm not as sad as I used to be but I hate that I'm still blaming someone who can never answer to me.
-1	negative	loss-to-suicide	My dad committed suicide when I was 3 I barley remember anything about him, and I feel like it has really effected me growing up as a child, my mom wasn't there because she went into a depression and stopped eating and drank all the time, always had loser boyfriends who would beat her and my brother and sister left when they were 16 barley ever see them now, I feel so alone it feels like I have no family no one to love and no one to be loved by. My life would be totally different if my dad were still alive, I would do anything to have him back.  I don't even know why he did it  I thought we were a happy family
-4	negative	loss-to-suicide	My dad died before I was born, all I have of him are pictures My granddad acted as my father and helped me through a lot, but then he died when I was seven.
-5	negative	loss-to-suicide	my dad got mad at my little sister (who is my everything). he is violent and kicked her in the head (he isnt hurt now) and screamed at her, my mom and me. i am scared and my anger is building and im also very depressed . i really want to cut. i hadnt cut for a good 9 months until last week when my girlfriend cheated on me. 
-9	negative	loss-to-suicide	My dad passed away 11 years ago when I was only 9 years old.  At weird times when I'm either thinking about him or stressed out I'll find pennies in the strangest places.  This morning on the way to take my GRE test for graduate school, I said some prayers and asked my dad to help me have confidence in myself during the test. At the testing center, they give you a locker to put your belongings in. Upon opening mine, I found a penny heads up right in the door of the locker.  Unlike my mother, I have always been skeptical about "pennies from heaven". But this morning after finding my penny from my dad, I found confidence in myself for my test just as I asked him and confidence in the pennies I find truly being from heaven.    
-3	negative	loss-to-suicide	my Dad passed away on March 12. I have had a really hard time with his passing.4 days after his death death I found 4 pennies ina row in various places. I feel that was him trying to let me know he is OK.
-18	negative	loss-to-suicide	My dad was such a great man. There was not one day in my life where he had not made me laugh. With anything he did. He'd be cooking and singing at the top of his lungs, or even dancing! The only bad trait was his drinking. But other than that, he was my best friend. We got along better than anyone I knew, and I was around him all the time. I went with him for walks to the store, whether it be across the street or across the city. We worked together delivering Chinese food for a while, and that was the greatest! My dad would talk to my friends as if he'd known them for years. He'd go on and on to my one friend about being in the marines. He'd threaten any guy to break my heart or make me cry. He really was the guy to depend on. I knew he'd help me if I ever needed it, and he knew I'd do the same Rest In Piece daddy! Love you and miss you tons./;
-1	negative	loss-to-suicide	My daughter committed suicide on Oct 3rd 2012.  I miss her so much.  I am so very alone and sad all the time.
-3	negative	loss-to-suicide	My daughter died as a result of aortic stenosis and complications following a Ross procedure, aged 3yrs and 2mnths, in 2010. She would now be six and a half. I know she isn't really sending them. I don't believe in heaven. But every butterfly I see brings me so much comfort.
-4	negative	loss-to-suicide	My daughters dad passed on when she was 14 months old. It's been years and she is now losing teeth. We put it under her pillow . I played tooth fairy and put four quarters under her pillow.  She walked into the living room this morning with four quarters and a penny  I did not put the penny there.  
-10	negative	loss-to-suicide	My ex husband was very emotionally and mentally abusive to me leaving me with mild PTSD. Many people do not understand this, especially when i have anxiety issues due to it. I have overcome a lot since then but still struggle with it daily, especially since i am back living in a military town. My ex husband was an active duty soldier so if i see any military i get anxious, especially if it is army. I also tend to try and please everyone else make everyone else happy around me due to him. I have tried counseling it does nothing for me accept me feel worse about myself. I do not want to go on medication especially since i am trying for a child right now, but it is becoming harder and harder to cope. Any advice would be great!
-4	negative	loss-to-suicide	My father committed suicide when I was a baby. I spent a long time resenting that. Now I see it from his point of view. I can't quite forgive but I accepted it. 
-9	negative	loss-to-suicide	My father died when I was eight -- he was 35.  My family told me that he had had a heart attack.  The death certificate said otherwise.  They still haven't told me the truth.  I'm 44 now. We go through great pains to avoid motor vehicle deaths with the designs of our roads and vehicles.   Yet, we will hardly even discuss suicide deaths, much less act on a large scale to prevent them. 
-21	negative	loss-to-suicide	My friend commited suicide. But, I might have been the last person to talk to him. He was confessing that he was very attracted to me, and he wanted to take me to lunch in the days to follow. I told him I was busy, and I wasn't sure if I could. Then he said if I didn't want to, to just say so. And all I told him was, "I'm busy. I don't know if I can." I didn't hear from him the next day. Or the day after that. I did however, hear that he killed himself. All I can think is, what if I had said, "Sure, let's go to Five Guys. I love burgers." Maybe he would have waited a couple days. Even just one. And maybe he would have saw that life isn't all that bad. Then we would have gone to lunch, and had a great time, and he would have been alive. And I wouldn't have had to watch his father cry on his casket at the funeral and wonder what I'm going to say to them after the service.

-1	negative	loss-to-suicide	My friend's brother committed suicide summer of his sophomore year. His family has never been the same
-7	negative	loss-to-suicide	My friend, since third grade, Staci, wouldve been 19 years old today. I think about her every day. I still remember her smile, our inside jokes, I can trace my memories with her all the way back to third grade, the first day we met. We maintained a close friendship for nine years. Unfortunately it was cut short, because in the summer of 2011 she committed suicide. The aftermath of her death, over a year and a half later, still continues to haunt and affect me and has led me into a depressive guilt driven spiral more than once. 
-21	negative	loss-to-suicide	My friends joke about suicide nearly everyday. They have no idea what goes on in my head. How many times I've tried to end it. They don't see the scars that run up my wrist, I smile, to keep them smiling. The one friend I had the guts to tell, told people. It eventually died down when I laughed it off and made them all stop believing what they don't hear from the person they're laughing at. I come home, I cry, I go back down and pretend nothing's wrong. I want them to believe that suicide is no joke. It takes a lot for mental pain to turn into physical pain. Let alone letting the physical pain effect you mentally again, no one deserves the feeling that they're not good enough, because they are. So are you. Just believe in yourself.
-25	negative	loss-to-suicide	My friend tried killing himself one time and never got help. He is lucky to be alive. Well yesterday i am in second hour and he texts me; "now" so i respond "what" he said "i need you, come to your car" once i asked if he was ok he said no. And i was freaking out and asked to go to the nurse and then i just left and went to my car and apparently he took more pills and tried again before school. I had a feeling something was up when i picked him up for school. But i ditched and talked to him and he wouldn't fully open up with me. And i was shaking and crying i just want to help him. He knows I'm the only one he can relate to, yet he still only wanted to talk to his cousin which is actually kind of rude to him. But i hate when i ask if he is ok and he just acts like nothing happened. He tried to kill himself, that's not nothing. I wish i could help him.
-11	negative	loss-to-suicide	My Geography teacher (for his privacy, I'll just call him Mr. P) was that teacher who was everybody's friend.  He was always there for anybody who needed to talk to him.  He was also an avid outdoorsman; even though he taught in Georgia, he would travel all the way to Alaska to hike with students. I am NOT angry at him for doing what he did.  It's not in my place to judge him or be angry at him for his actions, and I don't know his personal life or his family life.  I just have to wonder what in the world pushed that kind, gentle-hearted, loving, giving man to commit suicide
-9	negative	loss-to-suicide	My Grandfather just died. I woke up to my alarm today at 8 am. I turned it off and looked at my phone. There was a text from my mother. I opened it to read, "My dad just died. I'm at their house now."  This is a sad morning.
-9	negative	loss-to-suicide	My grandfather shot himself in the head, many years later my first cousin died on the tracks in front of our house, 5 years after that my husband hung him self, then another cousin, over dosed on his meds, he was an RN, then my first cousins son was found hanging after his parents threatened to divorce. I was suicidal for many years, I suffer with post traumatic stress disorder, but I have clung to hope with all I have,  Im lacking in faith terribly, and am no longer on medication.  I have not been suicidal for several years now, life is better, but I still go through bouts of intense fear and nightmares.
-19	negative	loss-to-suicide	My grandmother raised me and was my best friend. She died about 15 years ago. I can't remember when the pennies started showing up but I have been finding them in the strangest places and I know she is sending me encouragement and love.  I am a caregiver and work for an agency, going into seniors homes and caring for them.  Yesterday I found a penny under a burner cover on a stove top in one of my clients homes. Another time I was cleaning out the ashes in my wood stove and found one in the ashes.  The strangest place I found one was in a clients incontinent system when I was  getting a client ready for bed.  I feel very close to Mum when I find one because I know it is her who is leaving them for me and it made me smile , she always had a sense of humor.  I love you Mum and can hardly wait until we are reunited in heaven but until then please keep the pennies coming.  They really brighten my day.
-5	negative	loss-to-suicide	my great grandmother passed away in 2005, and a couple of years later so did my great grandfather, soon afterward pennies started to show up in the oddest places, on the middle of the couch cushion, a freshly cleaned floor, in my brothers hat, even on my pillow. the pennies are always face up, and are either new or extremely shiny
-7	negative	loss-to-suicide	My half sister might have committed suicide today. There are however some circumstantial stuff that make me think its possible that she was murdered. If it was suicide I imagine I'll feel guilty over not noticing the signs. I cant think of any right now though. She was so happy, young, a new mother and had a great job. Its a waste. Unfortunately depression doesnt care about how good your life is when it strikes. Murder makes more sense to me than suicide.
-4	negative	loss-to-suicide	My heart is broken because I had to let him go I didn't want to hurt him. I knew I have 6 more days left and really don't want to hurt the people I love. It's so close. 
-1	negative	loss-to-suicide	My hubby and precious soulmate of 43 years passed away 4 months ago.        Great expectation of reuniting with my one and forever. Sweet heart.
-11	negative	loss-to-suicide	My husband and I were going on our 10th wedding anniversary this year, and have been together going on 13.  The last couple of years for us have been a struggle, to say the least.  With all of the stresses life has to throw at you, along with a history of unresolved hurt/feelings of betrayal, we had started growing apart, even though neither of us wanted to separate. If you take anything from this, please ALWAYS take someone seriously if they tell you they're going to commit suicideeven if they have a history of empty threatsI PROMISE you that it's worth the trouble if there's a chance you could end up feeling like this as an alternative option.
-2	negative	loss-to-suicide	My mom commited suicide yesterday at 5:00 pm. I am only 12 years old. I'm extremly depressed. I dont have a dad. But I have a grandma and a uncle. I'm just looking for a whole bunch of answers. I miss her so much. What do I do? 
-2	negative	loss-to-suicide	My mom compares me to my cousin who is really smart and it got so bad that I burned myself I have the scar still I was 10 and I'm 16 now. I still burn myself from time to time.
-11	negative	loss-to-suicide	My mom has tried committing suicide three times in the past three years. Her mother, my grandmother, committed suicide four years ago. It's been a rough four years. I miss my mom and who she was before we lost my grandmother to suicide. My mother was very close with my grandmother, which explains why my mom's grieving has been so difficult. I'm afraid to get close to my mom. She's been strange to me since my grandmother's passing and I've purposely distanced myself now that my dad has told me about her suicide attempts that occurred while I was away at college. I make it a point to call my mom often but I am still dealing with the disappoint. I want to tell her that I love her and to stay strong. I don't know how to stay strong and be there for her too. 
-3	negative	loss-to-suicide	My mom is my other half. My best friend, my everything. If there were such things as soulmates, she was mine. We had this deal that we'd die at the same time at 100 and 116 years old so we wouldn't have to feel the pain of losing one another. She was only 16 years older than I, and we were so close.
-9	negative	loss-to-suicide	My mom just told me a couple of days ago. He was my cousin. She told me how it happened and for a while I couldnt get the visual out of my head. I kept imagining what his last moments must have been like. I don't like to think about it. His memorial is in a few days and I'll be going. In my life I've been to alot of funerals and memorials and I don't think I cried at any of them, but I'm very sure I will at this one. It literally stings to think that he's gone. And it's strange because I didn't even know him that well. I didn't see him often, not even yearly, but when i did see him i immediately loved him. I think it hurts more because of the fact that he died by his own hand and not by something like cancer or old age or even a gun shot. Why does suicide sting so much more ?
-3	negative	loss-to-suicide	My mommy jumped off a 20 story building this month. i have lost her and my mind. I love my mommy.
-13	negative	loss-to-suicide	My mother decided to take her own life on November 6, 2005.  She was a kind soul and raised me and my sister well.  After 34 years of marriage my father decided to end the marriage and that is when my mother plunged into the abyss.  The divorce was a nasty affair and my mother just couldn't take it anymore.  I found out on a warm and clear November night (a rare thing in the Philadelphia area that late in the year).  I could have self destructed but a ray of hope also happened that very night.  I got a call 38 minutes after my mother's body was found, an old friend from childhood gave birth to her first child.  I look at that horrible day as even though my mother was "called home", a new life was created to take her place.  Looking back I wish I could of had the chance to least say goodbye.7 1/2 years later I'm still in pain from that day.
-2	negative	loss-to-suicide	My mother hung herself when I was five. It's not fair that it's my only memory of her.
-8	negative	loss-to-suicide	My mother just passed away on Sept. 24, 2013.  The whole day I was surrounded by butterflies.  The next day I was going about my day taking care of the funeral plans and I had seen so many pennies every where I was.  I have always known about "Pennies from Heaven".  To me by seeing and picking up all these pennies my mother was telling me that she has made it to heaven.  Thank you Mom, I miss u a lot.
-3	negative	loss-to-suicide	My mother passed on 08/14/13 this past Wednesday . This morning as I was walking up the steps to my office I found a penny on heads..  who knew that a penny could bring so much joy! 
-4	negative	loss-to-suicide	My mother took her life. She took mine with her. I will never be complete again. A tear still falls everyday when I think of her.
-14	negative	loss-to-suicide	My mother was a major depressive, schizophrenic alcoholic so she was basically doomed from the start. Despite all that, she still managed to survive 37 years on this earth before she put her life to an end. I have good reason to believe she would have killed herself sooner; but she was apparently waiting for me to be old enough. It is my belief that she emerged from her delusions only to find that she is still alone and miserable; and that she consequently gave up hope of finding somewhere she belongs. Disheartened by the fact that she didn't get what she has been yearning for, she put her life to an abrupt end. That is what I believe to be the why of it all. That is my reason for her suicide.
-2	negative	loss-to-suicide	My nephew died tragically 14 months ago, he was 17! I miss him & the whole family has been devastated because if his death.  My dad died 6 months to the day that he died so it's been very difficult dealing with all of this!!

-3	negative	loss-to-suicide	My oldest brother was someone i always idolized. So smart, so decisive. I thought that mentally and emotionally, he was the strongest most disiplined person I knew. Thanks for reading
-9	negative	loss-to-suicide	my only regret is I didn't extinguish myself 2 years agoand for that, i'm still here.don't know why i didn't,.they lied..things didn't get better, only worse. I let go of drinking and smoking long ago, no longer find any enjoyment in things that only relieved symptoms of withdrawal ..each day is bleaker than the one that already passed by, and only half as bleak as the one approaching. told EVERYONE that it's not a matter of if, but when.no one believes me or cares to discuss it.only well meaning therapists who could care less. Everything only serves as a reminder of my inadequacy..never good enough.only a placeholder till someone better comes along.
-6	negative	loss-to-suicide	My pet dog passed away last june due to uncertain reason. He's with me for almost 3 years. He's so playful, friendly, kind and sweet dog. I considered him as my younger bro and love him as much as I love my family. So, it's very hurtful to know he was gone already and I always miss him. ( I  want to own another one but we haven't still find the right dog that match our interest. Hopefully someday, we can find a good one. ^_^ 
-2	negative	loss-to-suicide	My phobias (that are weird) consists of the following. I have many other phobias, but none near as weird as those three..
-4	negative	loss-to-suicide	My scamp, my best friend who supported me through so much. I look at your picture and I talk about what you are doing now, I will love you forever x
-8	negative	loss-to-suicide	My sister took her life. I have lost loved ones before. It's is sad. But, This is so different. Yes, I feel sadness, loss, pain, devastation. But this loss also causes anger, frustration, confusion, guilt emotions that aren't normally associated with losing someone. I'll never be whole again. I'll never understand why. I'll never heal from this. She thought she found a way to end her pain. All she really did was transfer it to those of us she left behind and then multiplied it. I miss her. I want an undo button so badly. So much emotion nowhere to shelve it. My life is forever changed. A hole forever in my soul. A shattered heart with missing pieces. And I have no choice or say. It just is. And it's too late. I'm broken.
-6	negative	loss-to-suicide	My story is kind of long so bear with me. I decided to set boundaries today with my parentsmy mother is most definitely BPD (Borderline Personality Disorder) and my father is the ignorant peacekeeper in the family. My older brother has most recently decided to support my parents actions. That's my immediate family for you.  Is there anyone in this group that can relate?
-2	negative	loss-to-suicide	My wrist looks ugly again! Ffs I just can't continue leaving this way 
-1	negative	loss-to-suicide	Nearly four years ago I lost my best friend/boyfriend to suicide. 
-6	negative	loss-to-suicide	No one knows the struggle. No one knows how alone I am. No one knows how bad.. I want to cut. They look at the scars. They are so curious. If only they actually cared. Can someone stay and help me through this for once? No. They never can.
-3	negative	loss-to-suicide	Not gonna lie, I read some peoples stories and wanna tell them how amazing they are for being able to get through what they do but I get lazy and just end up heart-ing it. As a matter of fact this is kinda long for me now. Lol phones and texting  id rather talk lol
-4	negative	loss-to-suicide	Now a days I am feeling very lonely. Need real friends to share feelings. I am a married girl and my husband is really a gentleman but I dont have friends. 
-8	negative	loss-to-suicide	Ok so i know this isn't really suicide but My grandpa (when i was  had cancer and they had developed a new treatment at the time so they asked him if he would test it they said that if he did then he would die but he would save so many life's so he accepted it and later died
-6	negative	loss-to-suicide	Once I knew this girl, her name was Nicole. She was the most amazing person I had ever met. Kind, funny, smart, gorgeous e.t.c I cried for about four hours straight, I still am crying cuz I know I'll never see her again.
-2	negative	loss-to-suicide	One day, you will feel like a loser. Not any type of loser, but the one who lost it all. Maybe I am still that loser- that failure. But I just dont want to be the failure, loser AND quitter. Two is enough.
-2	negative	loss-to-suicide	one might argue we're not that valuable.  so you have to ask yourself: where does your control begin and end ? do you even have any kind of control ?
-1	negative	loss-to-suicide	One more week and I will have survived Another April.
-5	negative	loss-to-suicide	One of the hardest things to deal with when trying to overcome panic and anxiety is knowing what to do with all that excess energy. I know when I used to get my panic attacks it sometimes felt like I just wanted to jump right out of my skin! My heart would race at a thousand beats per minute and I thought one day it just might literally shoot out of my chest. Of course my hypochondria only made it worse because I was convinced I could have a heart attack at any moment. 
-9	negative	loss-to-suicide	One year ago from today I tried to commit suicide. Life was to hard and I had too many things on my shoulders. I cut my myself every where along my body to try to bleed out. Then after it didn't work I overdosed. I shouldn't be here today but I am. As a christian I know your not supposed to doubt or question God but I wish he would have let me die.  Life is still miserable for me and the pain caused  by people I thought could trust is unbearable. But I'm still ok and I hope I will see better days soon
-2	negative	loss-to-suicide	On February 18 (201, two days after my 14th birthday, I lost one of the best girls I have ever met.  I love &miss you.

-4	negative	loss-to-suicide	On May 10 I got the call that changed my life my big brother was killed in a car accident. I still find it hard to accept even though I know it's true.  I can't sleep as I think of him. This is rough
-17	negative	loss-to-suicide	On the 12th of December last night my best friend's brother committed suicide in his room. His mom found him dead in his room I do not know what made him think he didn't want to go on. I do not know what he use to kill himself. When the teacher told the whole school I broke down crying.I didn't care. All it meant to me was he was goneI wouldn't see home ever again. My best friend and her family won't ever see him again. My best friend always looked up to her older brothers. My best friend's brother was so kind. He would play with me and my sister,we laughed,we made jokes,we were happy. The last time I saw him was when he was picking up his brother and his sister (sister- best friend). I will miss him so much. He seemed so happyI will always remember him in my heart. But the best thing was that he loved The Lord with all his heart. And now we have another angel.               You'll always be in my heart
-4	negative	loss-to-suicide	On the 23rd of December 2011 at 7.15 am I found my mother/soulmate dead she had committed suicide. I jjust  cannot accept it believe or  ever gonna get over this im engulfed in grief that actually gets worse with time But worst of all she has broken my son's heart!!! 
-9	negative	loss-to-suicide	On the 23rd of May, 2006 my mother committed suicide. I was 19. I loved her so much and wanted so badly to be close to her. She raised me alone. We were close but distant at the same time. She had had nightmares for as long as I could remember. She sent me a text one morning telling me she was proud of me and loved me. It was so early, I don't remember replying at least not how I should have. A few days later she was dead. I found out the morning of the text she had claimed to have had an accident leaving a mark on her neck and a bump in her head. I think that was her first attempt. She hung herself. It doesn't get easier. I still feel like I can't breathe often. I miss her so much. I miss the relationship we were building. I miss her at every mile stone and I fear ending up like her. It was mad so much harder when less than a month later my dad was diagnosed with cancer, followed by my nanna. They both passed away the following year.
-6	negative	loss-to-suicide	Or directly after high school really. Maybe we weren't soul mates or destined to get married. But I loved that boy. We had been seeing each other for a while, it was exclusive.  I don't obsess over it any more but he still crosses my mind often. Reminds you that there's an emptiness in you that you forgot you had. Some days you just miss him more.
-21	negative	loss-to-suicide	Our mother passed on May 2, 2013. I was staying with my sister this past weekend and she said "where are all the pennies coming from?" they were being found all over the house. I told her, "haven't you ever heard of pennies from heaven?" She said "No" so I told her. She keeps finding pennies everywhere in the house. This morning I walk out to my Jeep to meet her at the Registrar of Wills, there is a shiny penny on the bumper of my Jeep! Then when I get home this afternoon, I tell my husband about all the pennies. He tells meuh; when I opened my beer case on Friday I heard something in the bottom of my box, I turned it upside down and two pennies fell in my hand. She is letting us all know she is OK. I love you Momma and miss you more than you will ever know.

-17	negative	loss-to-suicide	Right after I got out of college, I started to expand on the interest I had in acting. I had performed in two consecutive shows with an actor who always had a great wit and smile with him. I had seen him perform in other shows (and direct one) and I had always hoped to perform with him. Unfortunately, they were the only two shows I performed with him. Seven months after the last show he and I were in, he took his own life. I had heard one source that he had fallen on hard times. To this day, I always look back at his positive attitude and wonder why he would want to take his own life.
-4	negative	loss-to-suicide	RIP to my friend Yoko. May she be in all of our prayers tonight. It was Yoko's time, and anyone's can come at anytime. 
-4	negative	loss-to-suicide	Seems so simple but yet so hard to do I still dont know what she was thinkingWhy would she????How could she????
-13	negative	loss-to-suicide	Several weeks ago, my uncle passed away. Since I was part of a community theater production, the first thing I did was e-mail the director and producer to tell them of my loss. At the time, I didn't know when the viewing or funeral was, so I wouldn't know if it would interfere with rehearsal schedule. I also wanted them to know that if I seemed upset or distracted during rehearsal the following night, this would be why. They both offered me their cyber-condolences. (By the way, the producer was also responsible for getting all the cast bios. Even though it was past the due date of submitting the cast bios, she allowed me to make one amendment to my bio. In my last sentence, I said that I was dedicating my performance to my uncle "who passed away earlier this month.") 
-12	negative	loss-to-suicide	She commuted suicide 2 days ago leaving behind her 5 year old son. I know what she went through I knew what was going on in her mind but I never thought she'd come to this. Why'd u have to do this know when I needed u most but I'm glad Ur out of your misery I will love and miss u forever sis and ill take care of your boy forever.  R.I.P :"""( 
-6	negative	loss-to-suicide	She had been found In her room and she had slit he wrists her name is alex and she is in my heart and her memory will always live on 1994 - 2013 RIP
-6	negative	loss-to-suicide	She was depressed for so long but when I was a kid I never understood, and when she had to go to the hospital I thought she was just sick. She died almost a year ago and I was the first one to find her. The trauma from that day I will live with forever.
-9	negative	loss-to-suicide	since 4 years old I wondered why I was over weight and everyone was skinny around me, at 8 I began baking muffins and cookies and ate all of them. I was disappointed in myself so I started starving myself and self harming at 11 years old I always help people get through their problems but no one helps me, people need to know they're beautiful and worthy of life, if you haven't self harmed or starved yourself before then good because it honestly ruins your life
-5	negative	loss-to-suicide	So about a little over a year ago I lost my Uncle Tom. He had hung himself like two weeks before Father's Day and nobody knows why. Ever since I have lost him my world has been like a deep black place of no return. He was some one who truly understood me. He was always there when I needed him most, he never let me down. But one thing I will never forget is the last thing I said to him, " I wish you were never my uncle and I hate you" was my last words. I will never have the chance to say I am sorry or anything. I miss him dearly he was born on April 16, 1980 and passed away on June 8, 2012. I will alway carry him in my heart and I will always miss him. I love you Uncle Tom! &lt;3
-5	negative	loss-to-suicide	So around two days ago I carved words into my skin for the first time in a long time. I know have alone and failure on my left thigh. The whole thing triggered me into wanting more. I know I should be stopping, kind of want to, but I just can't. I just can't.
-5	negative	loss-to-suicide	So i cut for about a year after being bullied at my old school, and it started up again this year at my new one because of the stress of the workloadbut then my parents found out and i had to stop. Recently i discovered burning which heals so much faster and i'm hookedits kind of scary thoughim trying to stop but its so addictive.
-8	negative	loss-to-suicide	So I had 2 dogs (different times) my first dog was a Chow & his name was Cornbread. I had him since I was in the 7th grade & he was my protector. Sadly he passed in 2011. By that time I had a pitbull puppy name BB & he was the sweetest. He was a house dog & I spent all my time with him. He was 2 years old but he's in doggy heaven now. I miss my pets so much. I actually liked bb more than I like some people.
-14	negative	loss-to-suicide	Someone asked me the other day about my pet peeves Well here you have it. One of the few things that makes me very angry very quickly is when a persons refers to suicide as if it is no big deal.  No. No no no on SO many levels this is not ok!! I take myself to be a fairly tolerant person; just last night I was chatting with some random guy who was shopping online for girls panties- whatever floats your boat! But I have lost too many family members and considered it too many times myself to discus suicide in anything less than a serious context.
-2	negative	loss-to-suicide	Someone please message me, I could really use some advice about this guy I'm interested in (:
-1	negative	loss-to-suicide	Sometimes I feel lonely, scared and worried I will be left alone without a care in the world. And I will be left vulnerable to others to misuse me
-6	negative	loss-to-suicide	Sophie was diagnosed aged eight. Just over ten months later, she went into a coma as a result of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. We turned off the ventilator two days later. She was eight years, eleven months at her death, and she will forever be my wonderful, brave little girl who I love so much but can never hold again. I love you, Soph, my beautiful child. Not in my arms, but in my heart, always.
-1	negative	loss-to-suicide	So the teacher I talk about in my other stories has a lot to do with my self harm situation.  
-5	negative	loss-to-suicide	So today, I'm giving up my blades. I'm going to my friends house for a cut check, and I'm giving them to him for good. No more taking apart pencil sharpeners, just no blades in general. It is the official day that I'm giving all of this up.
-3	negative	loss-to-suicide	Stress was building up, It was like my drug.
-6	negative	loss-to-suicide	Ten years ago this month, my precious first born child, my son Joey, decided to take his own life at age 38,  It was the day before Thanksgiving that his father found him in his home.  I will never forget the phone call telling me my dear dear son was no longer with us,   It was and still is the most heart-wrenching experience I have ever had in my life.  The pain is always here in my heart though over time I have come to terms with his death,  I know he was in a lot of emotional pain and he no longer suffers,  He is in a better place now and one day I will be reunited with him in heaven when my life is over, Joey, I miss you so much in my life!  I wish I had been blessed with more time to spend with you my precious son,   I love you.
-10	negative	loss-to-suicide	The 19th of September the day he officially asked me to be his. It would have been 11 years. Would have been will never be it sneaks up on me some days usually when I am doing so good then boom. He killed himself really truly he did I will NEVER see him again. I miss him so deeply I am glad that he is no longer hurting and I am no longer being controlled. But I'd take it all a million times over to have him alive again. My life is so wrong now it was never supposed to be this way..Deep inside I fear my heart will never truly heal never. I may never be the woman I was or any type of real woman at all. I hurt for all that my babies lost in reality they lost two parents that day as most days I am not really here just making motions or playing a part. Just feeling it today thanks for listening. It has been two months and two weeks since my heart shattered inside me.

-5	negative	loss-to-suicide	The feeling of cutting yourself is a different kind of pain, it makes me feel human again. Every bad thing that happens in my life the only way I think I can resolve it is by cutting.
-15	negative	loss-to-suicide	The girl next door. The girl I always wanted to be. Let's call her Jance Jr. She had the prettiest aurbren hair. Her emrald eyes sparkled like the crystal clear water. Jance Jr was the girl of my dreams. What I didnt know, is that Jance Jr hated her life - and was fully prepared to end it right then. The smile she wore was fake. I didnt know this. I admired her. I loved her. I wanted her to know, that no matter what, she had a friend.

-2	negative	loss-to-suicide	There are currently over 110,00 people waiting for an organ donation. The largest group waiting is from 18-49 years of age. An average of 18 people die each day while on the waiting list for an organ donation. Organs and tissues from a single non-living donor can be used to benefit more than 50 people. Living donors can donate a kidney and parts of their liver, lung, pancreas, or intestine. Living donors can be evaluated to help a friend, family member or even donate anonymously to patients on the wait list. I am overwhelmed with pride - and my miracle boy keeps on giving. 26 lives, and counting.
-5	negative	loss-to-suicide	There are ten deep, jagged scars that run the length of my left forearm that have been there for the past three years. I've just been counting down the days until they'd go away but they don't. Applying copious amounts of foundation on them to go to prom, wearing long sleeve sweaters in the Californian summertime, and skipping out on beach invitations. The first cuts, cat scratches in middle school. But as things got worse the cuts in high school covered the whole length of my arm. And when that wasn't enough my methods changed to the depth, until I'd have to wear gauze pads and change them by the hour since my cuts would bleed for days until I was forced to get stitch tape on it. These scars tell a story but one I'm always too afraid to share with people. I don't want to let them define me but I'm too self-conscious even though I don't self-harm anymore to ever let them be seen. 
-18	negative	loss-to-suicide	There is someone I know who is planning on committing suicide this week, since she has really bad medical issues and she says she can not deal with the pain anymore. She is my mom. My dad asks me how I will feel when she is gone, and i always tell them i don't know since in a way she was already gone along time ago. The only thing she does now when she is back from the hospital is usually yell and then me and her have to go out begging for money so she can buy soda. She used to be nice and a really good mom, but everything changed when she got DKA and gastroparesis. So yeah, I definitely know someone who is going to commit suicide.
-7	negative	loss-to-suicide	There is two people I lost my baby girl faith she is 2 years old. She is my daughter I love her so much my mom has her .. I miss her every single day.

R.I.P baby girl I'm sorry all the things I did I wish I treat you better and I'm sorry for taking all my anger out of you now I regret every single day and I'm sorry if I didn't take you to that party maybe you will still be alive.
-7	negative	loss-to-suicide	The season is coming up and I am sure that the family is going to be thinking about my sister. She committed suicide last January and it has affected everyone in their own way. I still remember seeing her as I was the first to walk into her room. I wonder if I shouldn't have decided to go see her at the last minute with my brother.

-12	negative	loss-to-suicide	This is my first experience post, and extremely difficult to write about. My grandfather shot himself on August 17th, 2013. It was my aunt's birthday. He was a recovering alcoholic, and had a rough past with my dad's side of the family, but we never suspected he would take this route. He was prescribed Ambien, which has a common side effect of sleepwalking. Which means he could have been completely unaware of what he was doing. But suicide could have also been his choice. There's no way of knowing, because he's gone now. My heart aches for my aunt, who's birthday is scarred with her own father's suicide, and my grandmother who had to find him in that horrible condition. And, of course, my own dad who shares a name with him. I just wish none of this ever happened.

-11	negative	loss-to-suicide	This morning around 2am I received an email from him. He called me sweetheart and let me know that his travel went alright (to where he will be in Afghanistan) and he said he hopes that everything is going good here for me.  I got that message and felt both a moment of happinessbut it was followed fear. I could not handle it if something DID happen to him. Andwhat happens if he comes back and just like 5 years ago after his first deploymenthe detaches from me again. its a defense with him. Buthow can I fight that.
-8	negative	loss-to-suicide	This situation isn't easy, it's very tough, I have no real identity, and questionable value. I feel comfortable with who I am but at the same time I don't feel all that I could be right now. Anyways about two weeks ago, I started pushing myself to approach my current situation more seriously.  I've since found a job a few months ago. It took some creativity on my part in reaching out to employers in unconventional waysmaking connections with people but my sentiments about being unemployed remain and I hope if you're reading this get comforted by the fact that you aren't alone good luck fellow EPers 
-3	negative	loss-to-suicide	This will be hard to type right now, but I will explain.  She's a in a great place, watching over everyone. Our souls will fly with her. R.I.P Beili.  I am still broken to hear that she's gone and I think I will be for a long while, since it's still hard at school. 3 I will never forget her. :'( 
-10	negative	loss-to-suicide	Today I'm having my grandma-in-law take our Labrador retriever to the humane society. We have an apartment and he's too big and he's too rowdy and he scares our cat, and he's disobedient. He doesn't listen because of us. He's supposed to be in a big area to run, not in a cage in an apartment. He's been our buddy since he was a puppy and since my husband and I started dating. It hasn't been THAT long but I feel like I'm losing a piece of my heart. I love him with all of me but I'm doing what will make him happy.
-2	negative	loss-to-suicide	Today is 2 months since my best friend Carlos killed himself. September 29, 2012.. 10 days after his 15th birthday.. I feel numb some days. Other days I can feel the pain splitting my heart in half . These days aren't just every once in a while, there almost everyday. I wish I could forget it all because remembering it is so hard.. Music and drugs are my escape. He understood me.. We looked at life the same way.. I feel crazy sometimes. But I can't imagine how his mother feels. This is her second son that has died in the past 3 years. The first son was murdered. And now her other son killed himself.. He's gone.. Just like that.. In a blink of an eye.. Gone with the world still moving on.. People die everyday, I just never thought he would be one of them.. 
-6	negative	loss-to-suicide	Today officially I have been one year without cutting! One whole year. I have one this part of the battle, but I still have to put burning behind me. I can't belive it's been one whole year. Man, life goes by so much quicker when you're truly living. Yay!I'm so proud of myself.
-5	negative	loss-to-suicide	To me "Death" means less "Conscientiousness", less "Health" and "Sensory Perceptions.  More illnesses and inconveniences with last stages of "Life" (In the Process).Even getting Older, the world changes and even puts us into more isolation to a world that isn't worth it anyway, but where can I find this "Hope" in the process? (To feel that Good Health is what "Life" (Is)?) 
-4	negative	loss-to-suicide	Twice. I lost someone special a few years ago and no recently. Do you know how scarred this leaves you. I blame myself for all of this. I could have tried better to prevent this. I should have.
-3	negative	loss-to-suicide	Two. One of them was on here and the other was Alice. It Is a pain that not many people understand I feel immense guilt I was trying so hard to make them happy Like I can't write this anymore To painful
-12	negative	loss-to-suicide	Two weeks ago my wife's brother in law took his own life. He was only 46, and he had  so much more to live for. Finally, I want to pay tribute to this man, because he was in spite of everything, a very good man. I want the world to know how we was rejected and put down by his own blood relatives, how hard he worked, how selflessly he gave to his family and children, how well he renovated a house for them  to live in. To me, he was unfailingly kind, helpful and hospitable, a modest and principled man who deserved so much better. I will miss you friend, and remember you as you would wish to be remembered, for your kindness, warmth and generosity of spirit. You were dealt so much undeserved  hurt from an early age and internalized it all, and never complained. I do not and cannot judge, and my only wish for you is that you are now at peace and in a happier place of calm.
-19	negative	loss-to-suicide	Us girls. There were five of us - Nellie, the bully; Chrissa and Freida, her sidekicks; Miranda, my friend, and me. Sometimes there was a sixth girl, Laurie. Laurie was shy, but nice. One day, a girl called Weena started waiting with us. Weena was in a class with Laurie, and they were some-what friends. Laurie was the only person Weena could count on. Of corse, Miranda and I were always nice to her. One day, Nellie made an announcment that Weena was no longer aloud to sit with us. Chrissa and Frieda followed her. Miranda and I ignored her. But what surprised me most, was that laurie spoke up, agreeing with Nellie. I couldnt imagine what Weena felt. Laurie was her trusted person. Her only real friend.  The next year, Weena changed schools. I never heard from her again. Until March. Her mother posted Weena's story in the local newspaper. Weena's story of why she committed suicide. 
-14	negative	loss-to-suicide	Wednesday, May 22, 2013, my uncle committed suicide. he was one of the best people i knew. everyday he posted something inspirational that made me feel okay for once. like someone understood that life isnt always sunshine and rainbows. everyday he helped me make it through my battle with depression. he was a bomb tech for the army and did two tours of Iraq. he came back and was so okay because of the support of my aunt and everyone else in his life. they recently separated because of things unrelated to his PTSD. after she left, his PTSD really started affecting him in a negative way. even the smallest frustrations he couldnt deal with anymore. on wednesday, he rigged his oven so it would blow up the house. he call 911, told them there would be a body, hung up, then blew up the house with him next to the bomb. they didnt find all the pieces of him.  
-3	negative	loss-to-suicide	we just got my daughter a puppy, because her other one died from parvo, about 3 years ago, and now her new one has parvo i dont want her to die cus my kids would be so upset if anyone can help me with anything i can do for her please let me know immidiately 
-4	negative	loss-to-suicide	Well I didn't really know him. He was Junior I think but he hanged himself in a high school gym and as  a kid I wondered what was going through his head, what pushed him to this point? Only now can I understand.
-3	negative	loss-to-suicide	Well I got to talk to him tonight. And I've never been so excited to see my phone ring. But then he dropped the bomb on me. Apparently he might get deployed, he's not sure yet. As soon as he told me I started bawling. I couldn't help it, I knew I shouldn't have let him hear that but I couldn't make it stop. I am barely holding myself together while he is at AIT, I know I couldn't handle him being deployed. I'm so scared and confused. I feel like a terrible person for praying that he won't go since I know that it means someone else will, but I can't help it.
-5	negative	loss-to-suicide	Well, I just broke up with my last boyfriend, because he wouldn't treat me with respect. I'm looking for a very special guy. One who is close to my age, is a christian, and doesnt drink or smoke. He needs to be respectful, honest, caring, understanding, romantic, affectionate, and fun loving. Im not into games or drama, just looking for the man of my dreams. I want to become friends first, and develop our relationship as we learn more about each other. Are you the one Im looking for?
-12	negative	loss-to-suicide	Well, I was in boot camp at Great Lake naval station. There was this recruit I knew, 5 days prior to this he was caught having x with another recruit in our division. He was reprimanded, they were going to discharge both of the recruits from the military. So 5 days pass, we all go to take shower, hygiene, etc. Well he hung dental floss on a metal rod, put the floss around his neck, and jumped. The dental floss cut through his neck. Blood sprayed everywhere. Many if my fellow recruits were covered in his blood myself included. I'm still feel weird about this

-5	negative	loss-to-suicide	Well to start off with in 2008 my cousin Emma died at the age of 13 months. She died Friday February 13. The day before Valentine's Day. Last night my grand-father died. Valentine's Day is always going to be the sad reminder of those I have lost.
-13	negative	loss-to-suicide	We met over a box of crayola crayons - a big think to a five year old. Lydia and i are still friends. We ride the bus together, eat lunch logether, sleep over at eachothers' houses, get in trouble together, and live life together. Then Lydia called me - to tell me that her older sister, Macy, committed suicide last night. Macy was 18 - five years older then us. After helping Lydia over the hardship, her parents got divorced. Lydia stayed here with her mother, while her father ran off somewhere. A year or so after this, Lydia's mom got cancer. Lydia and I were at the local burger shop, where she burst into tears, telling me how she couldnt live any longer. She had the pills Macy had taken - and told me that she was fully prepared to take them.  Lydia smiled. We are still friends to this day.

-3	negative	loss-to-suicide	What are your beliefs on where people go when they commit suicide?
-4	negative	loss-to-suicide	when I got a call that my son's body had been found in his home.  He had shot himself. He was only 38 years old, my firstborn. Day before Thanksgiving it will be 10 years that he has been gone. That holiday especially can be difficult but also filled with happy memories of his life too. I miss him so much.  
-13	negative	loss-to-suicide	When I was 13, my best friend had died in a golf cart accident. I was devastated, and wanted to see him one last time. I took about 16-23 Advil and lied down to try to go to sleep so I wouldn't wake up. I started bawling, I went out to my mom, and told her. "Mom, I just took a bunch of pills and i'm so sorry." She called the hospital, but I refused to go in. She made me go to the bathroom to puke them up, I said I did, but I didn't. Nothing happened. I take that as a sign that God doesn't need me yet. It wasn't my time. I regret doing it. because after i started cutting really bad. i have scars up and down my arms, my inner thighs. i don't want my future husband to ask where they came from. I don't want my future kids to ask "mommy, what happened to your arms?"  Take Care 
-9	negative	loss-to-suicide	When I was 14-17 I used to self harm, I'm now 21 and I've recently started again. Quite often it's for things like I'm finding myself annoying, I'm stressed, feeling paranoid that my friends don't want me around, feeling upset or angry over something small but can't stop crying about it even though it's small, or for some other small whiny thing like that. I've never caused any bad damage, I'm convinced that only I can see the scars left from when I was younger. I've never done it badly, I just do it frequently (not so frequently recently). (wow, thanks for reading that, I think I rambled a lot. Thanks for answering and your advice) 
-12	negative	loss-to-suicide	When i was 14, a girl i had been dating for 4 months, and the girl i lost my virginity to, named Samantha, cut her arms and died. The day before she had told me she started cutting, and i felt sick to my stomach because i knew i had put the idea in her head by showing her the scars from my cutting. i begged her to stop, and held her for so long.seemed like forever, although it was only a few minutes. The next day when i got home from school.i found out.her parents would not even let me attend the funeral because they believed it was my fault.to this day i know that i am the one that caused her to do what she did..and i hate myself for it. to this day i dream about her, have nightmares about it. i cant get over it. R.I.P
-21	negative	loss-to-suicide	When I was 15, I lost my best friend to suicide. We hung out alot and our depression happened to get worse around the same time. We didn't talk much about it because i didnt want to burden her with my problems, but she was the first person I told when i first started cutting and when I was diagnosed. When we needed to, we would confide in each other. The last message she sent me was "I love you K, you're like a sister to me. I know I can trust you" She was still 14,. Even though its been over a year, I still see her in the casket or I see her in my dreams and her laugh isnt the same. She looks dead inside, but when I hug her it feels so real. I just miss her everyday. 
-7	negative	loss-to-suicide	When I was 8 my dad committed suicide, he took his life a a week before my birthday. It has been six years and it still rips my heart out there has not been a day that goes past when I think what was the last thing I said to my dad. I didn't see his for a long time before he killed himself. I think about all the stuff he's going to miss and a cry whenever I think about it. I miss him
-4	negative	loss-to-suicide	When I was about 12 years old I had a beautiful Himalayan rabbit that mostly lived outside but I often took him in to be in my room with me at night. Well, one night I didn't bring him in (I don't remember if I forgot or just figured he would be fine outside . . .) and he froze and died. It's been nearly 30 years and I still feel horrible about that. I don't know why but it's been on my mind much lately. I'm so sorry I forgot my little precious bunny. I am really really feeling guilty about this lately and it is very much on my mind because of the cold weather. Has anyone reading this lost a pet to hypothermia?
-21	negative	loss-to-suicide	When I was twelve my older brother was sixteen. He was getting bullied in school and it was hard for him. He always came to me to cry to because I was younger. It was hard watching him go though that but I thought he would be alright. The morning of his birthday I went to his room to wake him up but before I entered I saw a note on his door it said " ok I know it's my birthday but I'm over I did suicide I'm so sorry I love you Caitlynn". I burst into tears and ran to my mom and told her. The funeral was so sad I cried the whole time. Me and my brother always used to fight but If I could go back i would have treated him better. I love him so much and I miss him.
-4	negative	loss-to-suicide	When my daughter's death was recent, I located and went to one support group meeting for survivors of suicide.  I appreciated being able to talk about her, about the circumstances, about my feelings.  I see this group as a support group that I can attend at will, and listen to others, or not.  It is good to have that control over my exposure to the tragedies we all have endured.  Thanks for listening.
-3	negative	loss-to-suicide	When my leg looks like a bloody battlefield and then hamburger meat cut up I have to wear a cheer skirt tommarow
-17	negative	loss-to-suicide	When my mom passed away during cancer surgery, I was devastated.   A neighbor told us that when his father had passed, he started finding pennies in unusual places, like in bed with him.  He said he knew it meant his father was with him.  The next day, as I was helping my dad gather some of my mother's belongings, he offered to me a purse and wallet that she hadn't used for years.  I checked, and they were completely empty, so I put them in my room.  The next day, when I opened the wallet to put my ID and credit cards in, I found penniesthree of them: one for me, one for my dad, and one for my brother.  I really had checked and verified that the purse and wallet were both empty the day before
-1	negative	loss-to-suicide	When the next person is dead, and you're attending their funeral?You've got to look. Because suicide is not a joke.
-3	negative	loss-to-suicide	Will the thoughts ever go away? The flashbacks will they ever float away? Will the scars ever fade? Did I deserve this? 
-2	negative	loss-to-suicide	Wouldn't it be 'knew' someone? Since they're dead and all. "I knew someone who has committed suicide" hahaha

-13	negative	loss-to-suicide	Wow, When I Read all These Stories It Comforts Me Some But Still I Can't Help But Take The Blame. I Came Home From Work The Night Before, Got Distracted And Forgot To Close The gate. We Followed Our Usual routine That Night.  We Went To Sleep And My Wife Arose At 6:00 And Let Betsy; Our 11Year Old Beagle Out Assuming I Had Closed The Gate. When She Went Out To Find  Her To Bring Her On In She Hollered To Me "I Can't Find Betsy". By The Time I Got There My Wife Had Discovered The Gate Was Left Open And Noticed Betsy In The Middle Of The Road. She Had Been Hit By A Car And Must Have Died Instantly.  The Grief Was Deep And I Could Feel My Wife's pain. It Was Her Dog That She And Her Daughters Raised From A Puppy.  She Was A Joy To Have Around And I Loved Her As My Own. Before I Buried Her This Morning I Was Able To pet Her And Tell Her How Sorry I Was. I Hope God Allows All Good Dogs In Heaven. If So, She'll Be There. I'll Miss You Sweet Girl.

-11	negative	loss-to-suicide	You always expect that someone else's baby or a closed friend, or someone else you do not know commits suicide. But one late evening I learned of my wonderful niece. She committed suicide. If you are thinking about suicide take moment not to think about your pain but think about the pain you are causing others who love you. When you commit suicide the ones you hurt the most are the ones love you the most.

-1	negative	loss-to-suicide	You were my friend for just over a year  
-4	negative	loss-to-suicide	You would think if one of your best friends has recently just attempted suicide and is currently lying completely paralysed fighting for her life you would think differently about life. But recently I haven't. My thoughts are just getting worse and worse. I always promised Lauren if she ever left me I would follow her, now that I find myself in the situation I feel like I'm breaking her promise.
-1	negative	personality-disorder	11. Were all susceptible to it. The dread and anxiety of not knowing whats coming. Its pointless in the end. Because all the worrying, and all the making of plans for things that could, or could not happen, it only makes things worse. So walk your dog. Or take a nap. Just, whatever you do, stop worrying. Because the only cure for paranoia, is to be here just as you are. Greys Anatomy
-4	negative	personality-disorder	2013 was such a rough year and now it's 2014 and I'm like 40 lbs heavy and feel absolutely disgusting! I need help, I need more friends that understand me and get to know me for who I am and not who I look like. I need people who can relate.. My mom picks on me all the time . I feel like she doesn't love me because I'm fat and I feel like my boyfriend is going to cheat on me because I'm fat and ugly and idk . I'm afraid of not being accepted and I know I am not accepted by society . My best friend is 120 lbs and I would die to be her she is so pretty and skinny. I want to starve myself to get down to that. I wish I was 120 so bad!!
-2	negative	personality-disorder	6 months ago was the last time I did it. It's a secret I keep from my loved ones.  I feel like because she is inside of me she may feel my pain. If she does then I wont just be hurting myself.  After I have her I will probably do it again. I just cant help it.
-10	negative	personality-disorder	7 months ago I stepped away from my relationship with my father. He was diagnosed a borderline personality and depressive after his divorce from my mother and admission into rehab for alcoholism 20 years ago. My childhood with him was what you would expect from a child of a borderline, with me being unable to tell what kind of mood he was going to be in from one day (or even conversation) to the next. He always felt like his family hated him and would frequently speculate on how happy we would all be if he were dead or just not around anymore. Both my mother and sister got the brunt of the abuse, while I managed to hide and do my best not to get him angry. I was mostly successful, but on the whole, I feared him intensely. 
-19	negative	personality-disorder	A few days ago I found out that my friend's grandpa was in the hospital and it wasn't looking good at all.  After hearing the news I walked up to my apartment thinking about my friend and hoping that he would be okay and that she would be able to visit him before things got worse.  I was worried because I knew she was working and unable to leave and it really sounded like he wasn't going to make it.  I said a little prayer and as I reached my floor I looked down and saw a dime heads up.  I picked it up and looked at it.  It had my birth year on it.  Somehow seeing that dime made me realize he would be okay.  Hours later my friend was able to go visit her grandpa and he is still doing good. 
-16	negative	personality-disorder	After 5 and a half years my fiance left me because I lied to her.  She keeps her money in her safe.  Late one night, I went into her safe, and took money out.  I left it in a hoodie pocket and went to bed.  When I woke up, she had walked the dog and taken my hoodie.  Knowing I had no money of my own, she knew I had done it.  When she asked me, I swore I didn't do it, later she found that I had her key.  It ruined her trust in me, especially since this wasn't the first time.  All I want to do is become an honest person and show her that.  Show her that I love her.
-3	negative	personality-disorder	After I post an answer or remark on the boards, and some idiot tries to challenge me rudely because they don't agree, I am just not responding. My mind's not gonna be changed. Their mind's not gonna be changed. And so I am saving my energy and brain activity for more worthwhile activities. Have a good day.
-4	negative	personality-disorder	After I read a book call Introvert Advantage. I realize that I need to change the way I relax and get a rest. It totally eye opening. Since I applied what is recommended in the book, I no longer feel too exhausted. Now I know how to recharge my energy. I appreciate myself better. And happy to be myself in the crowd.
-3	negative	personality-disorder	all four of my cats and my one dog have their own personalities and i love them for it (although one of them always poops indoors instead of using the cat flap and going outside haha)
-9	negative	personality-disorder	All my friends and classmates have this direction to walk into and their lives are taking the shape they want it to, and I am still at the same point I was when I got out of school. I feel like a failure in life and I fear I will end up doing nothing. It scares me more than death. I have this talent and I dont know what to do with it. I have tried making things happen and something always happens and all my efforts go to waste. If you have some suggestions please do share them. Thank you.
-16	negative	personality-disorder	Almost four years ago I lostsomeone I loved more than life,the day before she died we quarreledand I thought nothing of it, sure that things would blow over and we would be back to normal the next day. therewere no morenext days and for the last four years I have been haunted by the thought that my words somehow contributed to her death, I must say at this point that shedied froman undiagnosed medical condition but at the back of my mind I cant help thinking that Icontributed to her death and on top of that she left without knowing how much I love her. I lock these thoughts away deep in my mind its the only way I can cope, but every year approaching the anniversary I always suffer nightmares and sleepless nights, I'm not the sort of person who doescounselling so I thought writing things here might help. to anyone who might read this please don't takethings for granted and make sure the people you love know it.sorry for being so maudlin its all I ever seem to do here.
-10	negative	personality-disorder	Although I have accepted myself as an introvert, the last three semesters had began with me trying to make friends only to lose them because I'm such a quiet person. This semester, I'm just not gonna try. I only tried because I was in college and should make new friends, but I'm fine alone. I just need a quiet corner and my Nook of who knows how many books and I have the perfect day. You know what? My friends are my books. Instead of trying to make actual friends, I'll let them come to me, whether it takes weeks, months, or years. The Happy Introvert

-4	negative	personality-disorder	Am i the only one who feels like nobody understands what im going through ?

-5	negative	personality-disorder	and I followed the truck on my bike trying to stay in the cloud.  lots of kids did it.  glad i did not diebut now as i age i regret that i did this because somehow it may come back to haunt me like give me some syndrome or something.
-7	negative	personality-disorder	And when i mean everything, i mean EVERYTHING. How i look, when to do my homework, my relationship, my college applications, my future, everything going on through out the day. there is a constant worry in my head and negative thought. this makes me a very sensitive person because i over think and think too much too fast. any action someone does, i automatically think they dont care deep inside. and everything just everything is a constant worry. i can never be excited about anything. i worry that i will fail nursing school or i wont get into nursing school because i am not very smart. i worry that my boyfriend will cheat on me and i worry that he never cares about me and i just worry and i worry.  its so annoying 
-5	negative	personality-disorder	An extrovert but some years later I became an introvert. I actually like that im introverted.  I used to want to be the center of attention and talk to anyone and everyone. Now, I sit back and I watch and I listen. Ill know everything about you and share little about me, I also do not crave attention I want it off of me. I do wonder why the change, anyone have a similar story?
-3	negative	personality-disorder	"An INFP is a butterfly that cant wake up from it's dream of being a caterpillar dreaming of becoming the butterfly." 
-5	negative	personality-disorder	Anxiety is now a huge part of my life. It gets in the way of my everyday living, and greatly affects any relationship (romantic or platonic) that I have. It drives my choices and controls me. I can't control it, and it's out of hand. I have an anxiety attack at least 4 or 5 times a week, and that destroys me for the rest of the day, and pushes me into depression.

-3	negative	personality-disorder	Any word i say, any word that comes out of my mouth might exasperate him. I always have to watch my mouth. And when i do that he beats me and yells my mom for that. He accuses her for me being wrong. I just wanna leave the house but i cant because i am under age and me and my mother need his money for living and i cant talk to anyone because i dont know how they would react. I am hurt inside. I just feel awful.

-6	negative	personality-disorder	a perfectionist Well when evver I do these projects for biology, I always want to make t the best I can. My teacher told me that I dont need to add any thing because Its really good. Shes the one who brought it to my attention that i am a perfectionist, because she told me that. I feel like If  it aint perfect, I am gonna fail. I try to make my pprojects amazing and perfect! 
-2	negative	personality-disorder	Apparently, every guy whose interested in me tends to forget me. At the end find their love of their life. I doubt I'll find one. Couples look so happy but I be upset to get hurt again. 
-8	negative	personality-disorder	Are you involved in an online relationship? Do you think you've found your soul mate but you haven't met in the real world? Is this perhaps due to low self confidence and self esteem and you need help to come clean and take your relationship to the next level?

-10	negative	personality-disorder	As of this morning, I have been dealing with an emotional burnout.  This is not uncommon for me, nor do I find it uncomfortable.  It is what it is.  I had a lot of emotional stress, spent too much time and energy helping others and I ended up draining myself.  The only real way to end a burnout is to be alone and to think, daydream, meditate call it what you want.   I am just curious if anyone else can relate to this.
-5	negative	personality-disorder	At first I just used scratching and rubber bands to keep down my stress from bullying but then when the idea of burning came into my head it wouldn't leave. It's the farthest I have gone and will go since I do not want to deal with blood. The only downside to it I think is that I don't see as much noticeable scarring as when i used to make deep scratches with plastic knives. I've only been doing it since March I believe, but I don't do it very often. I only self-harm when I'm in my deepest fits of depression and stress.
-3	negative	personality-disorder	At school, I am that smart girl.  I am that girl, but not the one they know about.
-24	negative	personality-disorder	At the age of 16 I told my first non-white lie. A lump was found on my back after testing they ruled out cancer. I had be struggling with my parents divorce and tried everything in my power to keep my family together. I sacrificed my own image to get their attention. I said I had cancer. I needed someone to listen. My parents were so caught up in their divorce my brothers feelings and mine where shut out. So I lied and lied til I got the attention I deserved. At least I thought I deserved. It created a snowball affect and I caught myself lying to cover a lie. I was into deep. I'm now 25 and have lived with this lie upon others. I found myself lying when things got difficult. I created a person I liked and that I thought people would like and care for. I've lost friendships that meant everything to me. I can't be trusted. I wouldn't trust me.  I need help. Am I the only monstrous liar out there?
-11	negative	personality-disorder	At the End of the Road ~ As long as I can remember I've been lying. I can make excuses why I did it. Because my mother rather go out with other people instead of staying home, while my father lived in another continent because of the divorce. This made me the primary caretaker of my brother. I detached to everyone, and never got over the fact that you need people who love you in your live. I can use so many things of my past as an excuse. But at the end of the day I am a young adult who lies and knows that it is wrong. Does anyone have any tips or guidelines for me? Or know what maybe my parents could do to help??
-15	negative	personality-disorder	Basically, years ago, I decided to catfish someone I met on the internet. (I no longer catfish people by the way.) I'm not too sure why I did itI thought it would be funny at first, but then I discovered how amazing the person was. The more we talked, the worse I felt for catfishing him. He didn't deserve any of this. Then school started, and I no longer had time to talk to him all the time. We lost contact for about a year. I felt relieved because I didn't have to pretend to be someone I'm not anymore. Then the other day, we began talking again. I know it can't go on like this forever; he will find out eventually. I want to tell him the truth, but I'm scared he'll never talk to me again. What should I do?
-8	negative	personality-disorder	because every time I see that I lost both my legs, I start to panic about why I lost them. Depending on what type of car it is, I panic every time I get into a sedan and when I see an SUV at an intersection I go into panic mode. I shut my eyes and breath deeply and tell whomever is driving to let me know when the SUV has passed. 
-6	negative	personality-disorder	because I never got to hold him in my arms, but I sang him lullabies, I picked out a name, and I felt him inside me, so the fact that he stopped growing before he could make it outside doesn't make him any less my child. Now I'm just a mother who never had a baby. 
-10	negative	personality-disorder	been smoking for a while actually. my sister was a terrible influence but i have to say smoking weed is probably the best thing she has ever showed me. its one of the biggest stress reliefs i have and i love love getting high. it helps me with my art a bunch too. and it helped me figure out who my friends are. 
-6	negative	personality-disorder	Being around others is so draining . Not because of their personalities  I just feel so much better and happier by myself . Even in groups , I find a way to get lost in my mind . I find myself ignoring calls from friends and sometimes lying to others saying I'm busy just to spend time alone. Don't get me wrong . I  Enjoy people and being around them but I prefer to spend 65-75% of my time alone . I hate feeling so awkward in groups or watching how I word things around people. When I'm alone I a myself  I am happy . I am able to express myself in whatever way fits best .  Although this was just a ramble . I love being an introvert . I don't think I have the energy to be a "people person"
-2	negative	personality-disorder	Being introverted makes everything harder. I feel like it's even harder because I'm the rarest introvert you can be; an INFJ..
-7	negative	personality-disorder	BiPolar disorder. You know the feeling. It's like anything of whatever, a person says or does, can trigger your mood. It doesn't matter how little it is, or how unimportant it can be. Something emotionally and mentally triggers you to get mad, sad, depressed, or anything negative at that moment.  &lt;3
-8	negative	personality-disorder	Nobody ever understands I know this was ridiculously long but I could have written something ten times as long and not have really scratched the surface. I just wanted to vent to and maybe find someone who has been there too. 
-2	negative	personality-disorder	Burning calms me down. It helps take an edge off the constant anxiety that I feel. I find that it works better than cutting. It also can turn me on just a bit. I need to burn to function in everyday life. I'd never give it up.
-2	negative	personality-disorder	but i cant change the past no matter how hard i try 
-1	negative	personality-disorder	Can Introverts and Extroverts Peacefully Coexist? That's my wisdom for the day.  
-12	negative	personality-disorder	Crazy Women- My mom has really never been there for me. After her and my step dad got divorced she turned to alcohol. Pretty soon she acted like we weren't even there. Ever since I was in 4th grade I have been raising myself, and ever since we moved in with her new guy. Which by the way is like the 4th time we moved in with her boyfriend. She is trying to become a parent again, but I've been raising myself alone for 5 years now. She can't just all of the sudden come back into my life and act like she has been there the entire time. Like WTF mom choose are in my life or don't you care. 
-1	negative	personality-disorder	Cut for the first time in awhile last night. It's sick how much I missed it. It's become a part of me. But it'll be okay.
-1	negative	personality-disorder	Cuts get more and deeper how do you know if I need stitches nah I'll just bleed out
-21	negative	personality-disorder	Cutting was the sacrifice i made to avoide focusing on what was truly hurting me.  It was the only distraction that gave me instant relief.  And I needed that. I needed it more then anything.  I was suicidal. It kept me from trying to kill myself.  no one noticed how inside I was bleeding. No one understood me no one understood that my scars were like a little crack in a dam. Cutting wasn't the horrible thing I was doing.  What I was going through was so horrible that the only way I felt relief was to try to feel pain . Sometimes I wouldn't feel anything at all and I just needed to feel.  If I didn't feel enough I cut until i did. If I felt too much I cut until i didn't.  If someone said something that hurt I cut. Even when I was happy I would cut.  It began taking over me .
-11	negative	personality-disorder	Darkness, take away it all. Claim it all, rule it all. Your realm your rules. My constant companion, you have always been, always been left when everything else run, flee or leave. I relish in you, like you relish in me. I find you so soothing yet inspiring. In darkest of moments, you dont change. You thrive in it, and that has to be admired. When everything else would crumble in those darkest of moments, you grow stronger. You are pain, you are wisdom, you are life, you are birth, you are death, you are change. You stand taller then them all, yet fall further then everyone. The savior and curse combined.
-1	negative	personality-disorder	Days like today leave me wanting to cry. I work so hard everyday and still have obligations I can not meet. How can anyone make it with the world turning insideout? Please.
-9	negative	personality-disorder	December 2007; I remember the day ever so well. I often feel upset and guilty that maybe if I went with her that night I could have prevented all of this from happening. A few months ago, after her 5th anniversary I took an overdose. Everything felt worthless and I didn't want to be here. I am majorily depressed and still get days when I want to end it all. I always wonder how different my life would be if I had a Mom, but I guess I will have to keep wondering
-1	negative	personality-disorder	Decisions i should of thought about a long time ago
-4	negative	personality-disorder	Did you know what you were doing when you walked into my life? You once told me that you were a monster - perhaps the only time you didn't lie.  I sacrificed myself as prey. 
-3	negative	personality-disorder	Does anyone else feel like they have too much in their closet but love the feeling of putting more in it? I love the feeling of buying the new cute clothes but then end up not wearing it for awhile. It's just the satisfaction of having it in my possession. Any tips guys? I don't want this to affect my future
-11	negative	personality-disorder	Does anyone else get anxiety when they're EXCITED? It's enough for me to be anxious constantly, but why does it have to get worse when I'm excited? I'll think of something exciting that is coming up or something that would make me happy and my stomach starts to hurt and if I get too excited I get nausea and I start shaking, almost on the verge of an excitement panic attack. WTF anxietystop giving me symptoms when I'm excited! I hate being excited over things for this reason. :/
-5	negative	personality-disorder	Do you remember going off to school for the first time and realizing that you would be there alone with strangers? I still remember the first day of preschool when it hit me that my mother was leaving me there. Kindergarten wasn't so bad because I met my best friend at the beginning of the first day. Another introvert, of course. Still young men, we've been friends for nearly thirty years.
-2	negative	personality-disorder	Do you walk into a room and look for the nearest exit just in case something goes wrong? 
-19	negative	personality-disorder	During the day you see the smiling girl she wants you to see: the one who's happy and perfectly fine. She throws up her masks and wears a jacket claiming she cold. She laughs an jokes like it's a normal day not wanting to ruin anyone. It's funny she laughs, they never noticed the broken girl inside. They never knew about the comments she gets, about her past and life. They only see what she wants them to.  At home at night she brings out her blade and brings it down on her skin. The blood is Soothing and release the pain. She cuts and cuts till the pain is numb then cleans up her mess and smiles. The cuts bring her pleasure that not many can under stand. The comments and things she gets melt away with the rest of her thoughts as she drags the blade down. The perfectly happy girl they see isn't what's actually her.
-4	negative	personality-disorder	eeh i just shop too much.. I dont even need all those things.. I have so many shoes jackets skirts.. bags. and no money at all!! how do people manage this addiction to shop?
-7	negative	personality-disorder	Eh, family can be overrated. You can't choose your family.  I speak from experience. I've been shunned be my remaining family (1 younger brother, sister and twin). My family made me physically ill and not worth it. Life is too short, be good to yourself because you deserve all the goodness life has to offer and that means changing your outlook in life to welcome the positive in your life. I hope this advice helps sone ~~ Mary
-1	negative	personality-disorder	Especially with school. Basically, I must get 90+ or higher. I can bear 80s, but any lower is unthinkable. I'm not really satisfied unless I get 95+. 
-3	negative	personality-disorder	Even after many years of my father being diagnosed with BPD, I still have trouble understanding and often feel guilty for being mad at him. Even though, in theory, I know he has difficulty controlling his emotions I still get mad at him for not being rational and overacting to even the smallest stresses. 
-7	negative	personality-disorder	Even with all of this stuff involving my friend leaving me when I needed her the most, my ex trying to get me to come back to him, and family troubles. I have managed to go a week without cutting. And I think that is a pretty awesome  so as I'm writing this I'm collecting all of my blades and throwing them out I feel sad but if I've gone a week without cutting I'm gonna try and go as long as I can without cutting.
-7	negative	personality-disorder	Ever since I was little, I've enjoyed pretending I was someone else. It started off with characters from my favourite books and movies, and then me and my sister would make up characters and act as them.  I swore it wouldn't happen again, because I really cared for Melissa, and I hurt her. But even now it hasn't changed. When I meet new people I tell them I'm from England or Scotland, and I usually follow up with a different age. I like to make up characters and act like them in public and on the internet. I feel like it's a problem and I should stop, but I can't help it. I love to be anything but what I am. 
-2	negative	personality-disorder	Every night before I go to sleep, I play "Vincent" by Don McLean Possibly the most beautiful but saddest ballad ever written.
-7	negative	personality-disorder	Everything I do must be perfect. Perfectly aligned, clean, clear, beautiful. But of course it's not. Especially new things, for which I don't have enough experience to make perfect. Like design. I am in a strong battle with myself right now, because I love design, but don't know enough about it to make the perfect things I want to make. And I have reached a point of blockage and don't know how to get out of it and start moving towards something. Technically, I can do it. The technical part is the easiest. But the creative part is killing me.How do you get over a creative block? And how do you get over the fear that whatever you make will be just awful?
-1	negative	personality-disorder	Everything out of place drives me crazy
-3	negative	personality-disorder	Feel like I need to vent anonymously. My parents no longer talk to me and I'm having a very difficult time accepting this.   Of course I have not listed everything in this post. It would be much longer believe it or not. 
-3	negative	personality-disorder	Finding out I am an INFJ was like looking in a mirror; horrifying and wonderful. I don't know about most of you, but a lot of what has happened in my life, good and bad, finally made sense. In a way it was closure.  
-6	negative	personality-disorder	First off, what is Body Dismorphic Disorder? Its a form of OCD that causes a person to fixate on a perceived flaw in their appearance. It can be debilitating, Ive been to the point where I could not go in to school or work b/c of BDD. It can consume your actions. You check and recheck your appearance over and over. My mom used to joke, *don't get lost in that mirror*! Before I heard of the term, I thought I was just hypercritical of myself. Just typical teenage stuff. Friends would joke, *hide the makeup and the mirror!* I realized later that my behavior was excessive and stemmed from something other than typical *insecurities*. Its just another form of control, basically, of self assurance. This website gives a better explanation of it. 
-9	negative	personality-disorder	Food addiction is one of the most under-recognized forms of addiction I think. Everyone eats, lots of people are fat, so what's the big deal with food addiction. It seems like so many people fail to realize that food addiction is REAL. It is also one of the hardest to contend with, because with a lot of will power, you can get alcohol out of your life, you can get gambling out of your life, you can get drugs out of your life, you can quit smoking, and hey, I'm not saying it's easy, but it CAN BE DONE. Food, you can't ever get rid of it. You need it to SURVIVE. But when you're addicted to food, you feel like it's killing youand perhaps it really is Love, Mabel
-7	negative	personality-disorder	For 9 months now I have been pretending to be a 18 year old guy, to an incredible 16 year old girl online. But really, I am a 17 year old girl from the Netherlands. It started as a complete joke, I was pranking on people from a chatsite as a guy because the jokes were a bit offensive sometimes and I thought it would be weird being a girl.  Everytime I try to even think how to tell her, i start to burst out in tears. Even now I am. I am extremely desperate for a solation for the mess I have made. 
-1	negative	personality-disorder	For many years I've used self destructive behavior to cope with daily life.
-11	negative	personality-disorder	For me eating is a waste of time. Yes it's a necessity but the amount of time some people spend eating is astounding. Not only do I find it a waste of time I find it slows me down, the worst feeling in the world is the one after eating too much.  If I could live without food I would. I hate it, it's a waste of time and effort and I really needed to get that off my chest. I don't think it's unhealthy, after all not eating helps clears my head and helps me focus whereas food slows me down and leaves me feeling sluggish. 
-10	negative	personality-disorder	For now, I'm a single mum to two amazing daughters, eight and six. I love them more than anything, than I ever believed possible. I love them so much. I regret not having more.six is a big age gap. But I have decided, I'm single and it's tough enough, if I find someone I truly love? Maybe. One to two more children. If we can afford it- financially and emotionally.
-1	negative	personality-disorder	For years I had beat myself up for being an introvert, always berating myself . 
-14	negative	personality-disorder	funny thing is that i've been suffering from anxiety ever since I could remember but never realized it until now.  i remember "those" feelings but never understood.  Now that I have some knowledge about anxiety disorders it makes clear sense but how did I get that way?? my panic attacks began during high school but I'm not sure what started triggering them..   I thought it was religous thinking and end of the world type of stuff but sometimes I could think of those things and nothing happens.   I still get panic attacks everynow and then but I don't let them rule over me anymore
-1	negative	personality-disorder	Goodbye cruel world, tonight I'm taking this life!
-2	negative	personality-disorder	Hahaha, I'm so glad there is a recognized avoidant personality disorder here. I don't know why but I just avoid people when I'm walking through a hallway or anything. I just dont want it to be awkward. Cause it already is awkward. And then it becomes even more awkward because i'm avoiding them. Some people see this as an indifference to them when I actually just dont want to be awkward towards them although avoiding can be seen as offensive or awkward. I don't mean to seem cold or anything but i just can't help the avoiding thing sometimes. I try to be more comfortable and say hi or smile now and it's helped a lot but there will always be these awkward moments that bother you at how awkward you just acted.
-10	negative	personality-disorder	Has anyone ever seen the movie "you again"? Yeah well that's what it's like with Caleb's gf. Caleb is the nicest person and deserves better than her! She tolled me I was in her way and I should kill myself because it would be better for everyone. She also tolled me my mother was lucky to die because she wouldn't have to deal with me any more.. Yeah she's a complete **! She got mad because Caleb had to leave on a date because I was in the hospital. Her names is Britney btw! Hunters gf is the other half of the United States! And he's played # 2!!! 
-8	negative	personality-disorder	He barely was there when I was little so why should I be there when he wants me to, because the last I checked he would rather not have the bother to have to pay to try and help raise me. So why do I even try to get him to acknowledge me when I knew it was useless? Sometimes I wish he never tried at all.
-15	negative	personality-disorder	Hello, Today was the last straw i guess. What I am about to say is tought! I have been lying to my parents. Maybe the reasons are that I am lazy or that i don't appreceate the, ( that one is not true) or maybe because I have to. Today my mother asked me if i smoked and i told her no but i did. My parents are REAL non smokers and i have been told " do not smoke, why do you smoke, its bad for you etc." and i know that, but forbiden fruit tastes better? I told her no because i knew that even if i said the truth it wouldn't matter, she and dad would be sad that i smoked and i didn't want her to hurt her in that way. I know that i hurt her more becausei lied but is there a differance? I'm lost, I want to stop and have a good relationship with my parents again but how can i do that after hurting them so much?!? Is it possible?  
-7	negative	personality-disorder	Hello. Iam new to this. I think it feels really good to find others who feel the same way. I have felt trapped in a dream for a little over 12 years. I smoked pot & had a panic attack and when I woke up the next morning, this is how I felt. Like iam in a dream, emotionless, like everyday after that was the same. Now though, been trapped for 12 years, I can't even explain it, my life just gone in this state of mind. Makes me sad. I don't even pay that much attention to it anymore. I know iam not right but unless I'm talking to somebody I pretty much don't think about it. I always feel like whoever I'm talking to knows something's wrong with me but I think iam pretty good at faking iam normal. Anyone else do this? I don't want anyone to know whats wrong with me and have only told a couple of people. I tried to get help but neither of the meds worked. Made me feel more clouded in the head. Anyway,  I'd love any feedback or comments that may help. 
-9	negative	personality-disorder	Hello! My name is Andrew. I'm new here in this body. And I figured I should tell you a little about my body owner. She's really nice and tries her best to help people all that she can but she isn't always noticed and a lot of people treat her like crap. Her body is covered in scars from the battles that she's lost with herself because of these people. I feel sorry for her and I'm kind of the one who gives her a backbone and helps her to not put herself in harmful situations. There are many more of us. I'd like to tell you more about all of us but there is too much to say. Not all of us speak up but we make ourselves known lol. But yeah, I hope that I can meet some of you as myself but it will problly be through my body owner.
-12	negative	personality-disorder	Hey everyone this is my first post. And I'm happy I finally found a site for people that have INFJ personalities.  I took Meyer Briggs personality test about 2 years ago and got this result. It's been really hard to find people that can relate to you and has been lonely. No matter how hard I try its hard to find someone that can relate to you. Ever since I was a kid it's been hard to get along with people my own age and have always got along with older people better. My family & family friends have always known I was more different than others and more knowledgeable for my own age. I just want to find some good friends that can relate to myself and good friendships.  
-17	negative	personality-disorder	Hey, I'm a 13 year old guy (I'm not sure how my profile says I'm 22 or 2 But lately I've been worried if I have OCD. I have a brief understanding of what it is. What the main problem is is that I get hear thoughts of my family or friends or even my dog being hurt, killed, abused, etc. The only way to stop the anxiety from it is to just go and touch something that I love or use everyday, and I don't want to step on any cracks in the sidewalk or else someone's gonna die. It's a scary position I'm in so I thought I'd ask you guys, thank you for your time, it's the first time I've ever used EP. Bye
-2	negative	personality-disorder	Hey this link is pretty accurate when it comes to introverts. Do check it out and let me know  
-11	negative	personality-disorder	Hey ya'll. I'm an INFP and I totally get the analysis of the our supposed "personality" (aka I was right there with everyone as the feeling of recognition and enlightenment washed over us upon reading the desc I have a therapist that I talk with regularly so I have had deep discussions with her about this but sometimes feeling like only one person really understands can be isolating. How do you guys feel? Have you felt like no one can fully live up to your expectations? If so, have you overcame it in any ways you'd like to share?
-2	negative	personality-disorder	Hi everybody, I hope you'll answer to me even if I'm not schizophrenic, I'd like to know more about this mental desease.  PS. sorry for the bad english, I'm from Italy :P
-3	negative	personality-disorder	Hi everyone I am new here and thought I would share my story. The officer and my husband at times has also told me that the times when they "rage" and try to drive us away is because deep down they feel like they are horrible people for what they have done, and they don't deserve us or to be happy, so they try to push us away to "protect" us. Screwey huh!!!
-11	negative	personality-disorder	Hi everyone i just found out i have polyfragmented DID. I truly believe i have one if the worst cases. I most definetly have thousands of parts. And a hanful of personality clusters most i do not really think i know. It is very confusing living like this. I have a part of me for literally every task i have to accomplish a day. That includes walking writing everything just everything. I also never know who i am. I always feel disconected from people even ones i know and am constantly switching when i see a person or even an animal. So it is quite literally impossible to form relationships with anyone atm. I am 17 yrs old. Trama started 12-16. I also have little to  no feelings or emotions for my old life nor any of my friends. Basicaly my question is that is anyone else going throughthe same thing? DID is one thing but because i have so many parts i cant really get to know my other personality clusters. I feel very lonely with this at times. A response would be greatly appreciated 
-4	negative	personality-disorder	Hi everyone! I would love to share a book called Living on Love the Messenger by Klaus Joehle.  Send love- I've found this to be the best medicine for my infj personality!
-2	negative	personality-disorder	Hi everyone, this is a blog I recently wrote about my experience with some not-nice extroverts:  Lion
-23	negative	personality-disorder	Hi I am 39 y/o and I have been lying ever since i was a child. when i was younger is was a way to protect myself from the real truth that was my life. However as I got older it seems like the worst lying became for me. I lied about most things if I felt it would get me out of trouble. I am about to lose my husband because of my constant lying.  It is almost like I don't know really what the truth really is. I love my husband and I do not want to lose him but if I do not stop he will walk away.    We have 3 beautiful children and I am starting to see my oldest son starting to pick up the trait of lying and i want to stop him before he becomes like me. I don't want to do this anymore.. I want to be free of this demon. I want to rid myself of all past lies and all future lies..this is not what  I want for myself or my children.My husband should be able to trust me. I think this is my first step to my honesty freedom.
-6	negative	personality-disorder	Hi, I am a compulsive liar and i need help. I have told many lies  to friends, family, the love of my life and to myself. Its like it comes natural sometimes without thought. It started when i was young, when i often told lies to stay out of trouble, or to fit in. Now that Im older its becoming a huge burden in my relationship, now I lie to protect feelings. One thing I've learned is that, its better to hurt with the truth than to protect with a lie 
-22	negative	personality-disorder	Hi, I am new to this group. I joined because I am confused an need help. My main question is, do I have MPD. in my head I hear two voices (John and Potentia) Potentia rarely speaks, so I am usually talking to John. Potentia has been there for a long time (don't know how long exactly) John has been there since grade five. I remember little of my childhood, and have had two blackouts (that I know of), during these I was apparently conscious and able to write, walk and talk. Sometimes I have impulses (caused by Potentia) usually I can control them but occasionally he takes over. But when he does I see what happens, I just can't control what happens also I have little recollection of time (only when Potentia has been steering for a long period of time) which is usually 20 minutes to 1 hour, then I get control. I assume when John takes over I have blackouts, but this hasn't happened in ages. Sorry that was a big read, but my question for you, after reading that do you think I have MPD?? 
-13	negative	personality-disorder	Hi I guess this is my introduction. I'm camillia and have MPD. I recently have become aware of this pay couple of months. I have 2 alters, Denise and Kayla. Dempsey is the protector one, she comes out when my feelings are hurt or when I'm upset. She will stand up for me. Kayla is the carefree one. She has issues with men so she tries to use them. I know why they were created, both of significant events in my life. They get along but sometimes I get jealous of Kayla. I know they suppose to co exist but it's hard and I don't understand how to do it. Am I wrong to feel this way? I have no one to talk to about this. I'm hoping I can't talk to someone to help with this. Thank you.

-14	negative	personality-disorder	Hi i know iv posted maybe more than my share of postings but i feel pretty desperate. My question is does anyone know how long polyfragmented did can take? I dont want to sound- err- ignorant? Idk but i think i have one the worst cases of polyfragmented DID. I have thousands of parts and parts that i do even know exist except for the fact that i write in ajournal. So does anyone know how long it mighttake to recover thousands. Say 4 a night maybe?
-4	negative	personality-disorder	Hi I'm 16 and I suffer with anxiety. When I was about 8 or 9 I was diagnosed with a skin disorder on my legs. I didn't feel normal so I just shut down for like 5 or 6 years. When I saw people walking with shorts and cute little dresses it made me sad. Now I'm in high school and. I want to try out for basketball but I can't because when I get nervous I can't function right.
-10	negative	personality-disorder	Hi, I'm older than you think an younger than you know. My whole life is based on a lie. I started lying from a very young age mostly through bullying and an unhappy home environment. Recently i have met someone that i love and adore ,my lying has complicated the relation and she has caught me out rumours times. Thankfully she has given me the chance to start again. Free from lies ,to live a normal life.
-2	negative	personality-disorder	Hi just found out I'm a infp, is that good bad or ugly? Anyone have any info??
-12	negative	personality-disorder	Hi! My name is Layoutshooter and I am an avid sportsman and former NSA agent for real. I told some real whoppers at an expedite trucking forum that I have been a longtime member and I just got busted after years of building my reputation and this just sucks! I was arguing politics and I said Hippy's spit on me when I returned from service. I forgot that I had changed the story and this Cuban Sammich just found the contradictions and outed me. Now everbody knows I've been lying and I can't go back. I have friends there and over 265,000 posts on the forum.
-3	negative	personality-disorder	Hi there, hello. i am an introvert. Its hard to find groups like, where you can share or read about othersand not feel some what unique, as we are in the world outside this group.. hahaha.  Criss Jami
-5	negative	personality-disorder	Hi, this goes out to all those that are suffering from panic, fear and agoraphobia, I know some days can feel pretty low but hang in there, there is life after panic attacks. I suffered through occasional panic attacks that later spiraled into a crippling 4 year battle with agoraphobia and constant anxiety but through patience and determination, i got through it and so can you! 
-1	negative	personality-disorder	how can a person have apd and be a narcissist. anyone elce have these two disorders? the vulnerable narcissist? im a rare breed .. im self obsessed and avoidant and anxious.
-1	negative	personality-disorder	How long will it take for a deep cut on my wrist to turn white?? Or even gone..?
-3	negative	personality-disorder	I accidentally clicked on this, then realized before I could figure out how to "undo" that I *am* an introvert.    The roles and experiences are blurring, inverting
-4	negative	personality-disorder	I always feel like it's necessary to buy certain things even if they're  really cheap I convince myself it's not a big deal and then all of a sudden I am out of money because all these spending sprees have added up and I end up feeling angry at myself and flat. I feel like I'll be a better person if I just buy this new bag or get this new makeup and often I end up not even liking it or using/ wearing it, but at the time I feel so elated and happy it's like a drug and then when I look at my account and realize I don't really need all these small items I feel low and flat and I just can't seem to save up for a Europe trip I've been planning but putting off for years because I just didn't have the money. Does anyone have any advice I feel like this is a serious problem and I'm just realising it!
-2	negative	personality-disorder	I always get asked how I can be agoraphobic and claustrophobic at the same time but I am.  I guess the only safe place I feel is at home
-4	negative	personality-disorder	I always have been an introvert. I enjoy going out sometimes, but it takes so much energy out of me. I feel like i recharge by just spending time alone. I enjoy the ability to just sit home and relax. I feel like I have to make excuses not to go out with friends sometimes. I'm not sure why people want to go out every weekend. I also hate staying out all night. If I go out, I want it to be relaxed and in to get some much needed sleep. I've always been such an old person inside. 
-13	negative	personality-disorder	I always thought I was lucky. I thought I had it all. Most of my friends came from broken families, but mine was fine. I don't know when it started, but it's not fine. My brother applied and was accepted into a college that my father doesn't like. My father refused to talk to my brother for weeks. Another brother of my recently was diagnosed with diabetes, and trust me, it's a much larger deal than you think. He's always angry or upset and he doesn't talk to my mother any more. My mom just wants to be a good mom but it's hard for her. She cries every night. Everyone is always angry or screaming or crying, but not me. I hid from everything in my room, to get away from it. I feel like nothing is right and I'm all alone. My family is falling apart and I'm all alone 
-5	negative	personality-disorder	I am 14 and am diagnosed with complex ptsd severe depression adhd extreme anxiety inssomnia and extreme anger issues i also cut and have attempted suicide i am seeking therapy now but it is only kindof helping let me know if any one cares what happened to me or is around my age with the same issues
-2	negative	personality-disorder	I am 21 years old and I lie unnecessarily.My days are built of lies!I think I've started lying as a kid and never really bothered as it made me feel good!But now I realized that the real me is lost in those lies.I lie to showcase myself as a powerful,rich and very happening person!But luckily I havent got onto major troubles yet! 
-7	negative	personality-disorder	I am 27 years old and can not stop lying to everyone in my life about everything. I have been lying to friends and family for well over a decade now and nobody believes a word I say. Lying has ruined my life! The worst part is that I can't stop! Is there anyone out there who can help me? -South Georgia Liar
-13	negative	personality-disorder	I  am a 100 percent mamas boy , I was born in 93 my dad left us in 96 . So I had a single parent most of my life I did have my grandparents as well (and still do) my dad hasn't spoken to me since I was 13! My mom never said a bad word about him like most teens I acted, a fool up until age 17 and a half but my mama stood her ground and made sure I knew who the head of the house was . Though we've bumped heads every now and again I wouldn't trade my mother for the world she's one of a kind .
-4	negative	personality-disorder	I am a 27 year old Single Dad, facing multiple problems at this point in my life. I have always been a nice, helpful guy, and have done what I could to help others before myself. Now, I'm reaching out for help. This is my last resort. supernova (at) psend dot com
-6	negative	personality-disorder	I am a 42 year old woman and I have been diagnosed with Conversion Disorder, although I am skeptical. The past two weeks have been filled with MS-like symptoms, difficulty walking, talking, sometimes even feeding myself, and I was i the hospital for five days, very humiliating to have someone take fully care of you right down to baths and bed pans.   Now I fell like I'm making things fall apart. 
-6	negative	personality-disorder	I am a child of a borderline mother and I am so happy to have met you all.  I am now 27 years old and have just recently started researching bpd after a friend of the family profusely apologized to my brother, sister and I and suggested that I read up on BPD because she believed that my mother had the disorder (which was later confirmed by a therapist that my sister and I went to see.  He said she was NPD and BPD).  I didn't think much of it until recently.  I'll just start at the beginning 
-6	negative	personality-disorder	I am a child of a borderline parent does anyone ever question if we married a person or surround ourselves with people like our controlling parent? Since it is all I know how can you tell? Are we just continuing the cycle
-3	negative	personality-disorder	I am a mum of two  I lost a part of me that day and it hurts 
-3	negative	personality-disorder	I am an INFJ but only just. I by 11%, N 25%, F 22%, J 12%. Although I am Libran, but undecided whether astrology is actually valid.
-1	negative	personality-disorder	I am an introvert and I love myself that way. This mean that a big amount of people and parties drain me out, so yea I better select drinking wine with myself or my small amount of friends. Cause lets be honest there cant be any big amount of friends . I do like reading books, visiting galleries, museums and if you need more action ow yes I go swimming and ice-skating at least once a week too. That does  not make me a nerd, just because I do not want to scream, be with a bunch  of people I do not know and drink till I drop. Cause now I understand that make me happy.
-9	negative	personality-disorder	I am an introvert but at the same time I want nothing more than to find that ONE connection with someone that I will spend the rest of my life with. I want a deep and intense intimate connection and I want it to be just me and her for the most part. Sometimes I wonder if the type of connection I want is too unrealistic and if I am just setting myself up for disappointment and for a lonely life when it comes to love.
-9	negative	personality-disorder	I am an introvert, though I have mellowed a bit in the last five years.  I can be good friends with people I know, but I have a bit of difficulty engaging with new people (even online). I have, as I mentioned, mellowed a bit, after going to college as a nontraditional student.  I was somewhat forced to meet new people.  It taught me that I can talk to new people.
-5	negative	personality-disorder	I am at a place where I am admitting my abuse of substances. I self medicate to try and deal with my deep deep trauma and attempt to hold my life together. I am tired of putting my life on hold.
-1	negative	personality-disorder	I am awesome at making things difficult for myself or maybe I'm still pretty naive. I trust the wrong people.actually I trust. I should not. Trust is wasted in this time I think. Though I can not say if trust was ever valued throughout the history of man. Good Luck.
-1	negative	personality-disorder	I am bashful, not shy. I can and do talk to people however, I get very bashful when attention is put on me. I'm outgoing and I engage in any conversation but if its about me, not thanks haha
-14	negative	personality-disorder	I am curiousdoes anyone know about INFJ shadow?  I read a little bit about it and am concerned that I might be going through it.  I have been depressed for a few months now.I don't find joy in pretty much anything. and I don't have energy.which is hard because I have so many ideas and creative things I would like to do  but I have no energy to do them.  Generally the thing I look forward to every day is just going to bedI have never felt like this beforeand I am just tired of being around people  and find myself being irritated and exhausted from interactions.  The rest of my family are all extroverts and normally this isn't really a problem but lately I just feel my energy depleted.  I do feel maybe part of the problem is I am working at a new job that is very stressful for me. I want to get better but have no idea what to doand wondering if maybe I am experiencing the INFJ shadow.  I would appreciate any help..thank you!
-2	negative	personality-disorder	I am Dr.Rahul, Physician in Training and I have DPD
-5	negative	personality-disorder	Iam far away from my husband for a couple of months, i love him so much. Unfortunately i met a guy and he seduced me and one night the thing that i dont like to happen, happened,, the following day he let me hit him and slap on his face, because he knew that i am so upset, now i am not comfort, too much confused, now i ask myself am i in love with my husband? Most of the time i think about this new guy. Help me please
-5	negative	personality-disorder	I am indeed still a work in progress. And I honestly don't want to be. I want to know stuff and be able to do stuff already. However, for me, it's not like that. And so I'm stuck with making mistakes and learning all the big stuff such as being compassionate, patient understanding and doing what's right etc blah blah blah. So  I honestly would like to thank the people who stuck by me while I'm still working on myself. 
-13	negative	personality-disorder	I am introvert and my mother is an introvert and my sister is even an introvert. My mother married an extrovert and my other two sisters harbor those personality traits as well. So, what's the problem here? We all seem to manage to get along in this mixed household. The problem is, people keep telling me I'm shy. My mom has always said I need to 'break out of my shell' and 'go talk to people.' I do talk to people, I have friends, and I've been told I'm pretty fun to be around. Before you launch into, "an introvert fun to be around? Oh my God, unicorns must exist!" I want to just say that I have a small circle of friends. Tiny. Like..three, four people. And we're all pretty much long distance because my family keeps relocating to various different parts of the US of A. So, it's easy to talk to them and yet I miss thema lot. But that's an off topic discussion that doesn't belong in this category. I hate it when people tell me I'm shy
-3	negative	personality-disorder	I am introvert.  It's maybe because of that that people find me awkward.
-4	negative	personality-disorder	I am like a totally different person. I can be utterly happy one moment and then i change into this scary girl who says horrible things and is unbelievable angry. People never understand why i hurt myself but part of it is that I'm scared to show what is underneath the surface. I feel like if i cut then the scary side of me won't come out and hurt the people i love. Because of this reason i'm not sure how i'll ever be able to quit. i feel like a freak that shouldn't be around people. This has caused me to ruin a lot of my relationships because i fear that they will see my other side. i also tend to isolate a lot. my friends say that it's just my eating disorder voice but i used to get extremely angry when i was younger and i would take it out on others. i don't want to hurt anyone. Maybe i'm just a monster that is meant to be alone forever.
-3	negative	personality-disorder	I am more introvert than extravert (though somewhat in the middle), intuitive, feeling and perceiving. This world is not made for Infp's alas. It's the outgoing ones who have the easier time, I'm afraid.
-5	negative	personality-disorder	I am not having a good day at all today. My mind is racing from bad thought to worse thoughts of the past, and all I seem to be able to do is pace franticly.  I dont want it to seem like Im just bitching and complaining, I just need to get some of this crap out before I totally explode. Probably woupd have helped a lot if I would have gotten more than an hours sleep last night too. 
-6	negative	personality-disorder	I am only 17. 17 year olds should be out spending their money they make at their part time jobs and out having fun. Haha nope, not me. I'm the type of person to save their money and i'm almost afraid to ever be completely broke. I think of the future most, I think of the family I'll have and the things I'll have to pay for and it is just scary, to know that you may not have enough money to get by at some points in life. I just thought to share my experience, as it is not just me who can attain this goal, but anyone with the will to do so, and quite frankly, I want to be the one to help anyone who needs it. Just ask me about it, I'd love to help you out ^_^
-1	negative	personality-disorder	I am ready to lose weight but can't seem to stop eating!!!!!! God why does food have to be so fking yummy!?
-3	negative	personality-disorder	I am the not the type of person that enjoys being around a number of people/friends/strangers. I'm not sure why, I just don't feel comfortable. My anxiety starts to kick in and i just feel really uneasy. I enjoy being around one friend at time (not that i have many anyway). I find it pointless to have many friends, how can one even keep track?  *I am not shy just prefer to stay alone and do not enjoy small talk much
-1	negative	personality-disorder	I am unemployed for the first time in my working life, 22 consecutive years of actual employment (not counting the lawn cutting the years for thatactual workforce).  I am a professional engineer and have been for a number of years. Thanks very muchalso new hereso forgive any instances of violating board etiquette (written or unwritten) in my post.
-4	negative	personality-disorder	I am very OCD! I sweep and mop daily. I double check my straightener and sometimes triple check it! I wash my hands multiple times daily. It's insane! There are many other insane things I can't even get into.
-9	negative	personality-disorder	I am very tired of people. More than recently. I work as a waiter and I dislike much of the customers that come in to work. But I can wing it.  It's just I see so many of them as selfish and dumb. I know not everybody is like this but whenever there's a person that's having a bad day and decides to take it out on me I just hate it.
-15	negative	personality-disorder	I apologise in advance for invading your place to share your stories. I have been reading them all and I have found them heartbreaking. In no way did any way did you deserve that. I am a BPD mother. I have son who is 8 years old. I have done my very best to shelter him from my 'illness'. He is a happy little boy, does well at school, has friends and we have a good relationship. I love him more than anything in the entire world. He was the reason I forced myself into years of treatment and why I take my medication everyday.  X
-2	negative	personality-disorder	I asked it elsewhere on the site, and got some suggestions He said yes. Any thoughts on the matter of the host dating a personality? ~Mina
-2	negative	personality-disorder	I became an introvert or maybe I was like this all along. 
-9	negative	personality-disorder	i bought this week alots of stuff that i don't need i was with friend who wanted to buy some make up..but when i went thereshe couldn't find what she was looking thereand there u go i am paying for all the stuff i just picked..it's kinda funny..when we go shopping..ofcourse i say no don't need anything ..i ll come to company u..then  my bill is bigger than my friend who  was the one who needed the shopping anyway!!
-1	negative	personality-disorder	I can live a relatively normal life. 
-2	negative	personality-disorder	I cant have a clear though.  I feel so lost and consumed by everyone "in" me.  Since the diagnosis they want to make themselves more know.  And I feel completely out of controll.  I am scared lost and confused.  I dont know how to get past all of these feelings.   I am so shaky and feel so achy.  Like I am completely crawling out of my skin.  Advice?
-8	negative	personality-disorder	I can't help but wander to the makeup counters every time my family and I take a trip to the mall. And once I am there, it feels like a waste not to purchase a new lipstick or two. My makeup storage has been piling up. I can no longer neatly organize my collection. Most of the items have yet to be opened. But for some unknown reason, my makeup brings me joy. My family loves to make jokes about my growing makeup collection. It is more than likely due to the fact that I don't always use the makeup. About half the days in a month I spend makeup-free. I know I need help, I really need to step away from the makeup counters for awhile. 
-4	negative	personality-disorder	I cant stop buying. I just got a job at my favorite brand and get a staff discount. I have no money, I struggle to buy food and pay for small bills, and I live with my parents!  There is not many helplines in Australia for this addiction. Its taking over my life and I am becoming ashamed of what I buy to show to the people close to me.
-9	negative	personality-disorder	I cant talk properly with my best friend anymore, we rarely see one another because we're miles apart, also the fact that whenever I try and talk to him he often replies with an answer that leaves no room to question  Is that how the world is, people come into our lives and then just go
-1	negative	personality-disorder	I could just be sitting there watching TV, or on my laptop, and 
-4	negative	personality-disorder	I cut all the way up my forearm. Red puffy bumps with blood that dots up in a little line. That's how I spend most of my nights now 
-14	negative	personality-disorder	I cut from when I was 12 to 16. I had up to a hundred cuts some days on my arm now it has been three years and it's weird I remember how I started like it was yesterday but when it came to quitting I never said this is the day I always said this is the day I'll try to stop I don't know the exact date I stopped but to me that does not matter. I wear my scars proudly now because they are a part of what made me, me. I will never be ashamed
-7	negative	personality-disorder	I cut on my lower legs cause if I slit my wrist everyone will see. There are a lot of scars that aren't healing. Every time it look down I remember why I have them. The story they tell aren't pleasant. I don't like to do it, I don't like the memories but once you start it's hard to stop.
-6	negative	personality-disorder	I despise writing concretely, I prefer the immersive imagery, the subtle clues and hints of poetry. In a way, it placates my constant self and external reflections. I am very rational, but I love the fact I am just, if not more, imaginative and creative than the extroverts that feed off each other's own ideas. I can't help, but feel gutsy about my originality, my whimsical and perceptive knack, my intuition.  I don't like slow things as "research" lays it out, I love thrills, it is just that its the thrill of learning and reflecting, creating, and expressing in the higher meanings that  life conspires. 
-1	negative	personality-disorder	I didn't know there is a name for people like me. In fact, for a long time I thought there was just something wrong with me. Then about three years ago, after some intense google searching trying to diagnose myself with some kind of mental disorder I came across the expression Introvert. Ok so that explains why I can't make new friends or hold down a job for more than a week. Sometimes I can't even go to the grocery store without getting a minor panic attack. To me, introversion is a curse. I don't want to be this way, but I can't change. I've just had to learn how to adapt my life around it.
-4	negative	personality-disorder	I discovered a book called 'Quiet: An Introvert in an Extroverted world.' Fellow Introverts, you should take it up and read it. It was very insightful. I learned I was an introvert earlier in the year by my sister. I was relived to know I am not anti-social. I am just introverted. And I wouldn't want to have it any other way.   When did you discover for yourself that you were introverted? 
-10	negative	personality-disorder	I ditched everyone after work. Had to get away. I spent too much energy trying to keep the lid closed. In the worst place to be when you want to get away from people: China. God these people are disgusting, unintelligent, uncivilized piles of meat that act like they are on par with other countries. What's that? You're telling ME how to speak English? Go home, you're drunk. If you nag me one more time about the dumbest thing, I'm going to throw you out of this conveniently open window and laugh when you hit the ground. hehe, that actually gave me a nice little chuckle. Well, beer time! later.
-1	negative	personality-disorder	I'd just 'Cut Off Ties With my Biological Family 
-5	negative	personality-disorder	Idk, i just can't fathom my life without her? i feel like there'd be a giant hole in my heart. We obviously argue, but at the end of the day i know that she's the only one in the world who would genuinely put me before herself.
-4	negative	personality-disorder	Idk i luv it and at the same time hate itthe feeling is great,but the scars are horrible.but even tho itz wrong,i cant and i WONT stop.i should have never started,cuz once i did the feelings were bittersweet.almost so addictive i think about it more than anything.so its not just that its really hard to stop,but its also my only friend.and sadly,itz the only one tht doesnt leave like the othersitz so complicated ;(
-1	negative	personality-disorder	I'd love to kill, everybody in the world. 
-3	negative	personality-disorder	I don't even know where to start. But why do I fall in love with straight girls? Hiding my sexuality ? Hiding the fact that I love to smoke ? I just wanna roll one and take a walk in the cold air 
-3	negative	personality-disorder	I don't hate my Dad, I don't hate anyone, but I strongly dislike my father. My relationship with him is really similar to one I might have with someone the same age as me - which for some people may sound idealistic but my father is over 40 and I am only 19. He just sent me a very ominous email saying that things would be "dramatically changed" when I return home from my trip because I did not respond to his earlier email "asap!!".  I have such a bitter taste in my mouth.
-12	negative	personality-disorder	I don't know the age limit on this but I'm 14.  What if were all just puppets and someone is behind the magnifine glass laughing at us. At out pain.  But the person is laughing also has pain in there own world. That's how bullies sorta react to sorrow. Others cut them selves or wear obsessive black or become the "freak" of the school eating spiders with no friends. Why do we do things when we stop the next. Two seconds ago I was watching tv now I'm typing  generally unaware of what I'm doing, when I'm done I'll open my eyes and it will feel weird I'm doing something else. Lately my head is so heavy my pillow feels fake under it, and it will feel blurry or not there and I had a high pitch screech. I guess I'm sorta just venting all the things I'm thinking and feeling. I think I'm just a pest in the world. If I'm gone it's easier.  I'm moveing my head in my mind but in real life it won't work.
-2	negative	personality-disorder	i dont know whats wrong with me..  where did i go?
-8	negative	personality-disorder	I don't know why.. But it's like everyday I just feel weird.. Like my body always feels on the edge and I find myself focusing on my breathing and the way I breathe. Or focusing on how fast my heart is beating. My mind races at random times I feel so out of touch with reality or different than everyone else. I feel trapped in my life. I'm a bit of a hypochondriac and I always believe there is something wrong with me. I wanna try different medications but I'm so scared of the side effects. I tend to feel this impending doom. Like why me? What does it feel like to be normal and not experience these feelings. I wish there was an on and off switch. It's not that I'm even in great danger I just feel like I am or that I'm loosing my sanity. It's miserable. And I have a good life but this constant anxiety puts me in depressions. It's not fair. Can anyone relate?! Or am I super weird.. :/
-10	negative	personality-disorder	I don't know why he did it but he's gone. My cousin and I always faught but he was my cousin and I loved him. Yesterday, the day before Thanksgiving my cousin shot himself. I haven't seen him in such a long time now I just wish that I would have went to see him maybee I could talked to him made him feel better. I hope he sees how mich he is missed and how much he was loved. 
-11	negative	personality-disorder	I dont quite know where to beginguess ill start with the basics. Im a 24 year old with 2 beautiful daughters. 4 and 3. Up until today I had an outstanding manhe decided he was going to call it quits (due to lying) until I can learn to be honest and a few otherbthings.lying was the biggest reason. We have been together nearly 4 years. And now my world is shaken. Not that he is wrong for doing soI just cant believe that it got to this point. That is my motivation.  I must stop to maintain my family. And to be a role model for my 2 young daughters.  This is the most open and honest I have ever been about this subject but it has gone too far. Any advice?
-6	negative	personality-disorder	I enjoy hanging out with myself. I feel like that is enough social bonding for me. However I have a solid group of friends whom I like to do Extrovert things with. I like to call these outings "Extrovert Binges" sometimes they last for weeks and then i need to cool off at home with some game of thrones or true blood to keep me going. or art and books, thats cool too.
-6	negative	personality-disorder	I feel as if I have so much love to give I want someone to build with not be in control of.  I want a love that makes me smile nonstop and can connect on different levels.  I feel so lonely and hurt.  I just want someone to care for me  like I can care for them 
-2	negative	personality-disorder	I feel different each and everyday. Like mentally different, like a different person takes over. Some times I'll be really happy and bubbly, other days I'm depressed, but don't want to be alone. I feel like I should name them sometimes. Depression, remorse, loneliness, anger, excitement, boredom..they all need names. Maybe it's multiple personalities, but then again, maybe not. Who knows?
-2	negative	personality-disorder	I feel everyone has a good side and a bad side to go they are.
-2	negative	personality-disorder	i feel free to be alone rather than following people around and make myself forced to be what they wanted. i'm thankful to be these way with my best friends and my family who supported me for no matter what.
-3	negative	personality-disorder	I feel like i have a lot side . These are my side.                                                                   1.  i used to be inoncent,naive lonely girl.                                 2. I used to act agresive and i get mad easily.                                                                3.i used to be so cold and say mean things.           What do you think?
-13	negative	personality-disorder	I feel like there are many different sides to my personality. I show one side to my family and another side to my sister. I'm a totally different person with the guys I like and a completely different person at work. Even with my friends I'm still different. Some of them see a side of me that others don't. I've been called fake before by my friends and it really hurt. It hurt me because I'm not intentionally being fake or trying to be fake. I'm not even fake in the first place. I'm just different when I'm around certain people. I don't like it when people who know me talk about me because sometimes they describe me in different ways. For example my sister would describe me as lazy, fun, crazy and talkative but my mom might describe me as quiet, kind, generous and thoughtful. Those are two totally different personalities. And yet there is only one person. I know I have a problem but it's hard to be the same person to everyone.
-9	negative	personality-disorder	I feel myself withdrawing from life. I live a lie every day. Acting how I see as normal, saying I love you, when I'm not sure if I even know what that means. My feelings becoming more and more distant. My heart becoming harder. I've seen a psychiatrist and a psychologist for 10 years. I've been diagnosed with PTSD, OCD, SOCIAL ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION, PANIC ATTACKS. My docs say it is all caused by abuse, not by any internal mental illness of my own organic chemistry. But my mind and my feelings are becoming more distant and more difficult to reach. I feel like I am slowly disappearing, one day at a time, until I become stone. Right now that's not even scarey.
-6	negative	personality-disorder	I feel so lost all the time. There are two sides of who I am. The side where I can possible try to forget everything and live my life and laugh have fun, without people knowing how I really am, and my real feelings.    I find it so hard to sleep at night unless I'm exhausted through out the day. The amount of thoughts that just run through my mind just come back as I'm on the quiet and alone. It's that time I feel like I was someone to comfort me and tell me "everything going to be alright".
-8	negative	personality-disorder	I feel you peering at me and trying to figure out who I am. You study my movements and little niches but you have a hard time pinning me down to one category or another. The truth is my introvert side is a defense for people like you. I know you want me to just open up to you even if it is just for a few moments. You want to know my story, how I grew up, what my life is like, my favorite hobbies and so forth. The only problem is I just can't do it. It is a chess game. A game where I am not prepared to lose. On the same side please don't go. Please keep trying. I'll let my guard down eventually just give me a little time..
-10	negative	personality-disorder	if i ever watch too much tv or netflix(as of recently), i hear voices of the people i was just hearing. not saying any exact lines from whatever they were from, just them, talking. i find myself listening to them more than i think to myself. when i do catch myself listening i think, "i wonder if this makes me crazy" just tuning into something that isn't real. i'm diagnosed schizoaffective, which is like schizophrenia and bipolar disorder combines, but is that an excuse? i feel stuck.  i'm loving my life right now, but i HATE myself.
-4	negative	personality-disorder	If i go into the bank or anywhere that has fliers or stacks of papers  and they are askew i take the time to straighten them all. I do it almost automatically when i see them and i do it enough times that my family and friends make little joking comments about having neat stacks of papers. but that is really the extent of my tendencies.I am in no ways a neat person i hate cleaning.  My stacks of papers at home can be any which way and it does not bother me only in public will i do it.
-4	negative	personality-disorder	I find it so weird but also interesting. I like having different sides to my personality, it's like being so many different people in one. I'm love it when I meet people like this, it's awesome being able to connect on so many levels and a variety of things. 
-1	negative	personality-disorder	If I only do one thing in life. I'd like to put a stop to ALL forms of bullying. No one deserves to suffer, especially silently.
-19	negative	personality-disorder	I found out I was pregnant and all I could think of was what would be best for her. I made plans to keep her safe from abusive people in my family. I gave her a name. I thought long and hard about what I needed to change for her to give her the best life possible. The when I went to the bathroom and saw all that blood my life took a very different turn. I gave up and really didn't care if I lived or died what's the use if I can't even protect my own baby. I hated my self for a long time and people around me where no help if anything they made it worse. I retreated into addiction and lost all hope. I have no idea how I made it though all that. I still miss my baby and wish I could have done things differently, but I know there is nothing I can do now. I have both the nuva ring and an iud now because I know it's not safe for me to have another baby and I don't want to go through that again.
-14	negative	personality-disorder	I found out I was pregnant at 18wks and it was a baby girl at 21wks on April 12, 2013 I lost her due to my placenta being infected it made me go into labor early she was so precious just shy of 1pound it seemed so quick when everything happened I had been trying for a long time. About 2months later I found out I was pregnant again but now this baby has something totally different from ny first child. This baby is said to not have any kidneys and without kidneys the baby wil not live the doctors say to terminate but miracles happen and im still currently pregnant and the baby's heartbeat is still strong despite what the doctors say that it wouldn't b there after 25wks and I am currently 31wks praying that something can change.has anyone experienced a baby without kidneys and there outcome or prayers or advice I really need it thanks
-9	negative	personality-disorder	I found out I was pregnant at only 16. I was due in June. I had miscarried only about a week ago. I was only 3 months, almost 4. I felt abnormal pains and saw blood when I used the bathroom. My mom took me to the hospital and did some examinations. Thats when they had informed me that I had miscarried. Although it was a stressful to be pregnant at only 16, I was devastated that something like this could happen. I was finally accepting my pregnancy until it was all taken away from me. I wonder how my life would have changed if it all didn't happen and my beautiful angel was born. RIP.
-9	negative	personality-disorder	If you have feelings, guilt, or remorse, you don't have ASPD. If you want to change, there's a 99% chance you don't have ASPD. If you have any feelings towards selflessness, you don't have ASPD. Stop diagnosing yourself and talk to an actual therapist about your issues. 
-4	negative	personality-disorder	If you're reading this you'll know. This site helps Who knew.
-7	negative	personality-disorder	I get absolutely exhausted by social interaction, I'd much prefer to be alone most of the time and spend time quietly thinking or playing music in solitude. I am however preoccupied  with impressions/what people think about me, so i put on an outgoing, extroverted "face" when I'm in public. Especially at work. Anyone else go though this? It's tiring!
-6	negative	personality-disorder	I get bullied but not by people my age oh no my family  The call me fat and tell me I am not smart and I'll get no where in life But of corse I have told no one cuz it's family isn't that what they supposed todo?
-4	negative	personality-disorder	I get jealous and possessive if I make friends, it sometimes feels like I get to attached and I know I should just leave them then
-6	negative	personality-disorder	I get very depressed and i used to cut myself alot i am alot better now i still have problems, i mostly want to help people who are going through problems anyone can message me and i will talk to you and listen
-1	negative	personality-disorder	I go through enough of this stuff to understand that everyone needs someone to talk to you. Feel free to message me if you need someone to talk to.
-5	negative	personality-disorder	I got the best gift for Christmas, another broken heart. That's what letting someone in and trusting them will do. He told me last night that he doesn't love me, that I was a toy. He said he had enough girls to last him a lifetime and I was no loss. The whole time he had a wife and several other girlfriends. My heart is heavy and I'm sad but I faked a smile for my kids and family today. Now I can crawl under my blankets and cry myself to sleep.
-3	negative	personality-disorder	I got very depressed when I was in my teens and started to cut my hands and wrists with a knife I had.  Things got so bad one day I very nearly slit my wrists all the way.  But I broke the habit and haven't done anything like that for decades now. See it can happen 
-9	negative	personality-disorder	I grew up thinking I was unattractive. I grew up thinking no one loved me.  Life has definitely gotten better recently. I'm reading the book the 4 agreements, I started drinking fruit/ vegetable smoothies, I'm doing yoga (and can currently do a hand stand which is so AWESOME because I've always dreamt and fantasized about it and now I can do it!!!), and I've forgiven my parents for all that they've done to me. I still don't talk to any of my family (I don't even know if my parents are alive) but I wish them the best.
-7	negative	personality-disorder	I guess I'm lucky I never got called 'shy'. Instead I get told I'm grumpy, I'm hypercritical, or I'm boring. I think everybody imagines me like a crosspatch old troll waiting under a bridge for billy goats.  Sometimes I feel like I have no place being in the world. Half the time I just want to hide.
-10	negative	personality-disorder	I had always suspected I had a problem with lying, but I never knew what kind of problem it really was. The lies happen before my brain has a chance to catch up. They come out, and it only taken a second to realize that I have no idea why I said the thing I just said. I'm terrible.
-12	negative	personality-disorder	I had really bad anxiety when i woke up this morning i was sick. I then got to school thinking that everythings fine and its all going to be okay. I got into maths and my teacher sent me straight back out for refusing to sit next to some girl. I go back into class and i sit away from her. I was laughing and smiling everything was okay, i stood up i lost feeling in my legs and my eye sight then went blurry, i started    struggling to breathe. Figured out i was having a panic attack and got sent straight to first aid and behaviour. After i calmed down this attack has left me feeling very sick and seriously anxious. I dont know whats going on.
-14	negative	personality-disorder	I had the strangest experience yesterday where I was in a busy public place and I felt like I recognised all of the people I properly looked at, like I got that feeling of familiarity then after looking away I realised I couldn't place where they where from, then realised i did not know them at all. The weirdest was some girl working in asda, whilst in her presence I was convinced she was my old friends big cousin who used to teach us dance and even conjured up a memory, and now thinking about I realise I don't know her at all, that that memory never happened and I'm certain of that but i was so convinced it felt so real. Like i said it happened a lot but that was the most detailed, anyone heard anything like this before so I dont feel so weird haha?
-10	negative	personality-disorder	I had two dogs whom I loved dearly.  I took them everywhere with me.  I had a pickup truck, and put a cap on the back.  I replaced the sides and back with screens.  They would come with me to work every day, join me everywhere I went.  My connection to them, particularly the younger one, was very special. For me, coming home to two dogs excited to see me, playing with them, made me miss my dogs that much more.  I think in another month or so I will get another dog.
-6	negative	personality-disorder	I hate my mind On good days I help people when I can how I can. Sounds typical I know but that's they way I am and I've accepted it, but when the dark of night rolls around I hear things, voices sometimes, sounds other. They don't tell me to do anything in fact they seem to be out to hurt me I can't silence it except when my mind is busy I don't sleep anymore from fear I feel my mind falling apart and I'm falling in a pit Dramatic sounding I know But I can't help but feel the way I do and I've told people who can start helping me find help and they tell me that I'm just full of myself and just trying to attract attention I feel lost in my own head I hate myself for it
-6	negative	personality-disorder	I hate the feeling I get when I have a million things on my mind and I have no idea how to deal with it all. There are days where I'm all calm and happy and others when I turn into a completely different person.  I really want to organize my thoughts somehow. That might help. 
-7	negative	personality-disorder	I hate to admit this, but at times I still struggle with this.  I have not done this in a long time and I feel a lot of guilt about it.  I hide it from everyone, so no one knows. I know I'm admitting to this on a "public" forum I guess because I get pre-occupied about thoughts of doing it again, and honestly talking to strangers is at times easier than talking to my loved ones about this. I just feel so uncomfortable in the skin I'm in.  It's strange because I'm very outgoing.  I'm blessed with friends and familyi do struggle from depression and am currently under medical care for and I have had years of therapy.  I think I just get overwhelmed by the emotional pain I have experienced in my life that doing this "act" takes the focus of the emotional pain and forces me to concentrate on the physical pain inflicted. I know this is very dark and I am old enough to know better.   Please feel free to share your comments from your own experience, strength and hope. Thank you.
-2	negative	personality-disorder	I hate when people are like ok just come talk to me when you have a problem  And you're Likeyeah that's why I don't tell anyone
-6	negative	personality-disorder	i have adhd and just want to die instead of living with this disorder i someone reads this and has adhd can you tell me how you live with it please it would really help me with this im 12 if you didn't know
-18	negative	personality-disorder	I have a little bit of OCD. I like things to be done a certain way, I hate when people do a job halfway and don't finish If I get a project started, say, painting a room, I want it to be done that day. I want the room to be covered in plastic and every step taken to insure nothing gets paint on it >.&lt;  I also have to re-rinse dishes b/4 I use them. Even if it just came out of the dish water, its gotta be rinsed. Sometimes Ill check and recheck my appearance in the mirror, just to make sure my eyeliner isn't smudged and hair is in place.  Its borderline OCD, I guess you could say. It used to be much worse. Ive been told it has to do with feeling a sense of control. 
-8	negative	personality-disorder	I have always been an introvert. I'm not good at talking to new people at all. I don't usually introduce myself to strangers. When I am talking to someone new there always comes a point that the conversation dies. I don't know what else to say and I'm pretty sure the other person feels awkward. This tends to make it difficult for me to meet new people.
-8	negative	personality-disorder	I have always been an introvert. I think I get it from my quiet. I just like being alone in a silent place. I like being alone with my thoughts. But being an introvert has many social complications. I wonder if I can become more extroverted if I try or if I will always be an introvert. 
-12	negative	personality-disorder	I have always been the girl that people talk to but no one really likes. I can be really fun and care free but a lot of the time I come off very rash. It's not that I mean to it is just how I am. I don't like to lie to people so ask me a question and I will tell you the honest truth. The thing I am the complete opposite of is fake, I don't smile if I am in a bad mood and if I don't like you I don't pretend I do. I struggle with my personality, I sometimes hurt peoples feelings when I don't mean to and because of that I think people just stay away from me then trying to get to know me. I am very proud I have become the person that I am and I wouldn't trade it for anything. I also have some amazing friends that accept me for who I am. I am just scared to go to college because soon I will have to make friends and I don't want to change who I am.
-3	negative	personality-disorder	I have a side with my family, a side with my friends, a other side with myself, a other side with my crush, and a other, and a other How can I know who I am ?
-3	negative	personality-disorder	I have a terrible fear of just about everything.  Sometimes, just trying to make plans makes me anxious beyond belief. It's not really social anxiety, because I can hold conversations with people just fine. But new places and new situations freak me out so bad.
-16	negative	personality-disorder	I have a verbally and emotionally abusive father.  He is extremely controlling and wants to mold my life and my siblings' lives. I listened to him because when I was younger I believed he was right, after all he was my parent and his weapon was that he pays for things and that I am not appreciative enough so I felt guilty and obligated he knew best, as he always said he did. My siblings are definitely hurting too, I can tell. He will never admit that other people have valid opinions or views, he only thinks his are valid and everyone else's values or opinions or beliefs or goals or dreams are invalid and worthy of attack if they don't match his.  
-3	negative	personality-disorder	I have been a liar for as long as I can remember. I have lied to make others like me. I have lied to get jobs. I have lied to my family.   
-2	negative	personality-disorder	I have been avoiding this site because I am so desperately trying to move on. But my body won't let me. I have never felt so alone in my life. I just want to scream and cry and I don't want to face another day. It hurts so much. In four months I was supposed to meet my baby girl, instead, I am still bleeding after losing her. My life has been turned upside down and I am sick and tired of hurting.
-4	negative	personality-disorder	I have been battling ocd since i was young and sometimes its too overwhelming, and it doesn't help that i know no one that suffers from the same condition, just want to talk to someone who can relate 
-12	negative	personality-disorder	I have been clean from self harm for about 2 years now, and I have had my wonderful boyfriend Logan for a year. Well last night, we got into a huge argument, because I had no idea where he was. Well I got angry, and I called him some names and ended up breaking it off. We got back together, and I was okay. But then I got this feeling inside I haven't felt in 2 years. I went to bathroom, took a razor and cut my thigh. I felt so awful and I took pills and I just lost it. I felt awful. How could I do this? I don't know what's wrong with me. I just want help.
-12	negative	personality-disorder	I have been dealing with this disorder since 2002-2003.  I have paralysis to my right side, difficulty speaking and have been in & out of hospitals, only to be sent home.   I was recently hospitalized on 10/1/13 because of twisting of my mouth.  It came out of nowhere.  I was fine the day before!   It is true though that once the CD is given to you, people, hospital personnel, doctors, treat you differently.  One of my doctors told me that it is "all in your head".  You have to will it so".  Of course, this really is frustrating for me.  I have lost hope.  I am tired, and I hate what it is doing to my son as well.   It is not in my head!  It is real.  I'm waiting for financial assistance from work and the SSA.  Everything is pending or in review.  I have no income coming in and is facing eviction from my apartment within the next 25 days.  I need help.  Any suggestions?  I am so frustrated. 
-6	negative	personality-disorder	I have been diagnosed with conversion disorder 1 month agoit is so good to know there are other people out there who are going through the same thingit has affected my whole life and I have lost a lot of my independence through not been able to walk at first, tremors which has affected my driving.  
-5	negative	personality-disorder	I have been lying to make myself look better for quite sometime, now I have the woman of my dreams and I cant stop lying to her. I want nothing more but to be honest with her but lies just come out all the time. 
-17	negative	personality-disorder	I have been married most of my adult life but after 2 failed marriages I find myself single at 43.  I have been separated for over 3 years and during that time I have not been on 1 date.  I just have not had the nerve to ask a woman out.  Flirting and dating seem to come so easily to other guys but it feels so awkward to me.  Its strange because I am in sales and dont have any trouble selling or interacting with customers but if I am attracted to a woman or I sense that she is flirting with me I just dont know how to respond and I think I come across as aloof and that is not my intention.  I am just tired of fear controlling this area of my life yet I dont do anything to improve my situation.   Can anyone else relate?
-7	negative	personality-disorder	I have been self injuring since I was 12. I wrote this poem while I was in HS. When things get really stressful and hard to handle I do get the urge and sometimes I do cut/hit myself. I have grown a lot over the years though. I hope that one day I will be completely self injury free. I will always have the scars, and the scars tell a deep story. and the crimson showers of temptation repeat over  again.
-7	negative	personality-disorder	I have been suffering from debilitating anxiety and panic attacks for the past few years. It got so bad that just the thought of having another anxiety attack actually triggered one. But after finding a site that adequately explained what anxiety attacks are, I have been able to prevent myself from having another one.It starts with rejecting negative thoughts and regarding them as just that negative thoughts. If you can manage to steer your mind away from these negative thoughts, instead of feeding them, you can prevent yourself from triggering your own anxiety attacks. I for one have found this approach very effective thus far.
-9	negative	personality-disorder	I have been trying so hard lately to get a job. I really need money for a plane ticket in August. I have applied to soo many places that I've lost track of them all. And every time I have some hope I am let down. I've been trying hard :/ For some stupid reason barely any places hire under 18. Ugh. Why do I need to be 18 to sell clothes or roll a freaking burrito.? And all the places that do hire 16 and 17 years old aren't hiring right now -.- Does any one have any advice or anything.? I'm dying here.
-9	negative	personality-disorder	I have bipolar and ADD. Neither mental illness defines me. I choose not to take medicine because I like to feel whether it's happiness or sadness. I sometimes think I need to get back on my straterra so I can focus in my classes but so far I'm doing good without it. I stay busy a lot and I believe that helps. They say an idle mind is the devils playground so I just keep myself busy.
-3	negative	personality-disorder	I have BPD With my over sensitive emotions I tend to cut as a release from me the pain And the sensation of calamity feels so good that it becomes an addiction The calamity being in direct contrast with my crazy thought process and mood swings It just feels so good
-2	negative	personality-disorder	i have found resently that if i begin to fight someone seriously i get over aggressive to a point where if i wasnt scared of it i would end up killing them. i fear this side of me but i have let it out on people before. please say there are others with this kind of split personality 
-5	negative	personality-disorder	I have had this for so many years. People do not understand because they can not see with their eyes any thing wrong. I have went through so many ups and downs. So many different ways of trying to cope. I have a wonderful husband and can go out with him in the car other than that I hide away do not want people to hear or see me in person, that is why I am on here. I feel I am very ugly deformed and stupid. sometimes it is like I surface, think I am coping then some  thing happens and I am back again hiding. I do not answer the phone or door at the moment as I do not what people to see or hesr me face to face.  I have cut all contact with my blood family. 
-2	negative	personality-disorder	I have never admitted this out loud, to anyone. I have a hard time even truly admitting it to myself, but it has destroyed my life, and I need to change.
-4	negative	personality-disorder	I have never been able to speak effectively to people.  Every time I manage to make friends by some fluke, they leave me really quickly when they realize I seem to have nothing to offer them.  I don't know what's wrong with me; I always plan what to say before I see someone, but I just can't get it out.  Just seeing people intimidates me, and I don't know what to do about it.  I want to meet people who like the same things as me whom I can talk to, but I can't even talk to anyone.    I'm always alone, and I don't want to be.  
-2	negative	personality-disorder	I haven't cut myself for one whole week but just a few minutes ago I did and I don't feel bad about it! My brother just ditched me at school and I had to wait two hours for my parents to come pick me up, I got four texts each from a different friend not at the same time though, and found out that they are all moving, so now I'll only have one friend at school, and while I was waiting to be picked up I found out that my parents were on their way and decided to stop and eat at a fast food place and they never got anything for me, I ripped my favorite jacket on the car door and now it's trash, I found out my fish died, and I just found out I'm failing one of my classes. I think that I've had a pretty rough day 
-8	negative	personality-disorder	I haven't layed a knife to my wrists in 3 years. I used to cut every other day because nasty rumors were being spread about me and I didn't like anyone. Now I have very thin, white scars on both my left and rigbht arm, though more are on my right arm. You can barely even see them now.  I'm glad that I still don't feel horrible and that I'm not cutting anymore, but I still get questions and odd looks when people see my scars and that always leads into an awkward conversation.
-1	negative	personality-disorder	I haven't self harmed in over two months. Things are getting too hard. I give up. Two months goes down the drain tonight.
-1	negative	personality-disorder	I have one friend. I see her very rarely. *sigh*
-22	negative	personality-disorder	I have rescued my kitten around May of 2012. He had eye infections and was very sick. My mom and I brought him to the vet. The infection went away and he started getting used to my family. We named him Niko. Everything was going great. One day I went off to school and I was collected early. My mom said Niko has been killed. She said that a car had ran him over and that she found him in my back yard with his two right paws in bits. She quickly brought him to the vet. The vet said there are no chances for him, that we just have to let him go He was put down at around noon. My little baby had not been even a year old, he was 11 months old.  No one can ever say how much a loss of a kitten hurts, especially when you were the one raising it: bottle feeding it and making him feel safe. He passed away on March 6th 2013. I still cry every night wishing I could have him back! I miss him so much R.I.P Niko I love you &lt;3

-8	negative	personality-disorder	I have so many sides. I show my different sides to different people. Some people know me as shy, some think I talk a lot, some think I'm crazy only a few know my inner self.  My sides depend in the people who I'm with and how they treat me.
-1	negative	personality-disorder	I have so many sides of me it's crazy I can be calm but on the inside I'm a lunitic trying to scrap its way out of me
-2	negative	personality-disorder	I have struggled with AVP for over 40 years - In the past 6 months I have been practicing Mindfullness and have seen a massive improvement in my behaviour and outlook on life. 
-11	negative	personality-disorder	I have the most beautiful man in the entire world. I'm truly a lucky girl to have him. Why do I say this? Two and a half years together, he has been by my side through everything. I began self harm about a year ago, and it didn't get bad until about six months ago. Yet he didn't leave me, or say I was a lost cause. He was there for me, and now being two months clean I have him to thank for giving me the support and love I needed to make it through this, I couldn't have done it without him. I realized today that I may have scars, but I'm still beautiful. Yes I went through a hard time, became weak, though now I'm strong again. This man told me that my scars don't represent who I am. And he's right. They don't. It took me a long time to believe that but now I do. Thank you handsome for being here for me every step of the way, and still loving me even when I didn't love myself.  Your my hero.
-3	negative	personality-disorder	I have this huge problem. Guys constantly hit on me and it is unwanted attention. I hate attention. It never stopsthe cable guy hit on me at my house yesterday, then some dude in a mac truck kept honking his horn at me, and a guy who looked almost homeless at Walmart asked if i was married. I don't dress slutty, i don't make eye contact, i don't have a magnetizing personality.  i just want to be me and at least have a day where i can walk around without the fear of someone trying to hit on me. Its been like this for the last two years and now affecting the way i treat people that im really interested inhelp
-8	negative	personality-disorder	I have to say there are lots of mistakes I have made big and small, I regret them so much, especially one, sometimes it hurts. At the end of the day I can't go back an change my mistakes but I can try and learn from them and in the future make a better job of it, or at least try. No matter how much I get judged in my mistakes and I know I do, I'm the one who has to live with it, not people who judge me, and you should never judge someone until you have walked around in their shoes. It's not fair. Life isn't fair, but if we keep our chin up and stay hopeful, things tend to look up.  Learn from your mistakes don't dwell on them too much
-11	negative	personality-disorder	I have undiagnosed MPD. I know of 3 other personalities and what I like to call the "occasional tourist". All of them have names, distinct looks, and personalities that make them stick out. My pictures even look like different people.  I hear people's thoughts and even talk to the telepathically. My boyfriend hates this because I know the instant he lies to me. It's only then that he calls me crazy and all sorts of names. Am I crazy; or am I just an evolved individual with no guidance?
-4	negative	personality-disorder	I hesitated with being an INTJ. I had to think about it more, to determine the truth. Because whatever why, it helps me.I tend to be attracted a lot to INTPs, other NF types. INTJs. Mostly all N types. 
-9	negative	personality-disorder	I honestly don't even know I'm lying until I get told by someone I'm lying. I believe every word that comes out of my mouth like it's 100% true and I'm sick of it. Of course I like it for the attention because I like it. I have five other siblings and I only had the spotlight when I was little. They just brush me off now :S I don't lie like this to anybody I love. But it's getting carried away. I've been working on it and I haven't lied to anyone recently that I'm aware of! So that's a start! :D
-4	negative	personality-disorder	I just got diagnosed with conversion disorder. But I have been suffering from it for 3 years. I lose all body function and callapes. Have cause my self concussions from falls. I also have violent panic attaks after losing. Body function. My whole body jerks and I get really tense. It is great knowung other people know exactly how I feel. Thanks for taking the time to read my story. Best wishes to all. P.s. during my spells I can hear but not speak and usually my spells last 20 min. Also sometimes when I can finally speak I stutter and stamer over my words. Also my cd seems to get worse during my period. And again thanks for taking the time to read my story. 
-4	negative	personality-disorder	I just joined this group in hopes of meeting people who might understand me a little. This is difficult.  I trust you understand.
-2	negative	personality-disorder	I just spent an hour organizing my underwear drawer. They go from red to green-ish then white to black.
-1	negative	personality-disorder	I just want to explode into the world. I must release it now or forever hold it to destroy.
-6	negative	personality-disorder	I know christmas is a happy time but last night (Christmas Day) I saw photos of mates with their girlfriends or boyfriends and I just cried myself to sleep that night because know one loves me like that ;-(
-3	negative	personality-disorder	I know this is awkward, and a little weird, but this is the only place where anyone will understand my question, let alone answer it. ~Mina
-4	negative	personality-disorder	I learned about child abuse in one of my childcare classes, and it absolutely sickens me what people will do to a child. There was one story where the mom's boyfriend tied her daughter's private parts together just because she had an accident. People are sick.
-4	negative	personality-disorder	I learned to understand why I was cutting and I learned to recognise when I was likely to do it. I gave myself backup plans of other things to do and I told people about it. Give yourself a way out. You can do this.
-2	negative	personality-disorder	i lie compulsively but involuntarily i think. i dont mean to. i just go about it. its ruining my life. 
-7	negative	personality-disorder	I lied about some very serious things four years ago. I got caught, eventually thank god! It was probably the most humiliating thing in my entire life. I've not been able to let it go and it still eats away at me every day. If anyone is in a similar situation, I'm here to talk. I don't judge, I want to support. I know how hard it is
-9	negative	personality-disorder	I like being an INFJ but it can make life painful at times. In conflict, instead of thick armor I have baby soft skin, an unfair fight really, where my enemy suffers little to no damage and I loose quarts of blood. All this filtered through my mind where's it's multiplied by 10 and an atrocity is born. Inside I scream, HOW COULD YOU DO THIS TO ME?! The other person? It's not such a big deal. Just part of the game of life where an eye for an eye or a selfish act of convenience is perfectly fine. They're playing by the rules, right? So it's fair. I just shouldn't be so sensitive. However, I'm glad to be who I am. Sifting through ideas, spending time alone thinking, planning improvements, and feeling my way through the days. I'm even happy to be sensitive despite the pain.
-6	negative	personality-disorder	I like being an introvert! it's not that I'm not social, I would just rather listen than talk. I do enjoy going out and socializing but in moderation. I always think before I talk which more people need to do in my opinion.. many people think being an introvert means being antisocial, but it's far from it. we just need time alone and aren't as talkative as others. well that's how I am at least.
-4	negative	personality-disorder	I like watching, observing things instead of talking a lot. Most time, I focus on my inner world. I send myself deeply down into my observation and feel, sense and think. I also love abstract ideas. I criticize this world though some people think i'm too cynical. well, I don't care what they think. My true emotion, sometimes screaming and crying, is buried under my peaceful cover. 
-11	negative	personality-disorder	i lost my dad 3 weeks ago to lung kidney and bone cancer. it left a gigantic void in my heart because dad had parkinsons disease as well. he was the greatest father you can ask for and did not deserve all those horrible things in his later years. a month before he died he cried. moms asked whats wrong? he pointed at my nieces and nephews and said in a soft voice in spanish yo nunca lo vere crecer. meaning i will never see them grow up..i love you dad and i stood there by your side untill your final breath..r.i.p daddy
-17	negative	personality-disorder	I lost my daughter Amelia 3 days before my due date October 17 2012. I thought she was going to be my miracle baby since prior to her i had 4 miscarriages. On October 16th I had went to my prenatal appointment only to find out there was no heartbeat, when all thru my pregnancy everything was perfect, no health issues, perfect ultrasounds. After i found out there was no heartbeat i was completely devastated. I called my husband to leave work so we could head to the hospital. The ultrasound there confirmed the worst, my beautiful baby had passed.Making a long story short after they induced me and it was time to deliver i had complications due to the fact that she was stuck and could not get her out..i was fretting and panicking the whole time unable to accept the fact that o had to give birth to a baby that was not going to be alive,i was  ended up having  do ac section
-4	negative	personality-disorder	I lost my job, involuntarily, on Monday this week. If anyone has any words of wisdom or knows of any jobs in California, my expertise is in Customer Service and Inside Sales, I would certainly appreciate it.
-2	negative	personality-disorder	I lost my little brother and his girlfriend July 9th 2013 to heroin overdoses. It's the hardest thing I've ever had to go through. We were very close. My heart still hurts every day.
-4	negative	personality-disorder	I lost my stillborn son on February 4th, 1990. I could feel him, kicking, moving, and growing inside of me. From the moment that I knew I was going to be a mom for the second time, I loved him with all of my heart.     His name was Shane Frederic, and he was loved by me. 
-5	negative	personality-disorder	I love my mother but sometimes she can make me hate her too. I think her biggest flaw is that she's impatient. She also has a ridiculously loud voice especially when she gets mad. By the sound of my mother yelling next door you'd think someone was about to murdered.
-9	negative	personality-disorder	I love my own company. I love letting my thoughts ponder. It's my time to let my brain breathe and unwind. Having so many friends isn't important to me, because most of them aren't really your friend. They are people waiting to betray you. In time they will.  Sometimes your friends just become annoying, you realise certain things about then the more you spend time with them. Not good things. When you just want a night alone or a day without the constant pestering and you're just thinking to yourself 'LEAVE ME THE * ALONE'
-2	negative	personality-disorder	I love that I am a part of a very unique group of individuals but at the same time, a lot of the times I just can't handle myself. While I may seem tough on the outside, my skin has only about an inch la INFJ probs
-16	negative	personality-disorder	I'm 38 now.  My relationship with my mother has improved greatly since I was a child -- or has it?!! Sometimes I can't tell.  I thought everything was fine and recently I caught her deliberately pushing my buttons -- she does this in a way that you can't detect at first but when you put it all together -- aha!  -- that's what she was doing!!  I got so mad yesterday that I told her -- "I'm not playing your game." Of course, the response I got was "What? I don't know what you're talking about."  She will ask questions in a way so that she can study my reaction -- and she will keep it up every time I talk to her -- and then I realize that she is trying to control me emotionally.   Does anyone else experience this as an adult with a borderline parent?
-2	negative	personality-disorder	I'm about to cut myself I have such an urge I love the blade against my skin
-5	negative	personality-disorder	I'm a little underweight and lacking vitamins and stuff, but only by a little bit. My doc says that I can take food supplements to help a little bit, but I don't have to, since my lack of vitamins is so small that it won't really affect anything, and it'll be alright as soon as my weight is alright. But to my mum, anything the doc suggests, even if he says I don't have to, becomes compulsory. She bugs me all the time after I have dinner to take a tablet, and it's so annoying. It tastes horrible and I hate swallowing tablets with water. And I hate when I'm just a little ill - like a 24 hour cold, and my mum keeps insisting that I have paracetamol. Even though I have syrup paracetamol, it tastes rancid. Ewww @.@
-5	negative	personality-disorder	I managed to stop for a while but in the back of my head I knew I craved to take out my stress and pressures and hurt out on myself. Today I gave in and I self harmed again. I have my reasons and I am ashamed of myself because I feel better for it.
-2	negative	personality-disorder	I'm an introvert. And observe more than you know.
-4	negative	personality-disorder	I'm a quiet person. I don't talk unless I have something to say. I need a reason to interact. Also when I get comfortable talking to you, then I will talk more and tease. 
-10	negative	personality-disorder	I'm at my breaken point of grief,and with this in my mind, i'll write. ABANDONED, this is the most important time where your love one come in play,this is were i have their support, they will help you feel your not alone.walk in my shoes, i'm alone. so the closes thing to me is my god, my church now my grief concealers, you know that expression, work it and it will work for you, well thats what i have to do, the worst of the most, when you cry for your self, this the most trying time, this is when mental illness can take over, the deep depression, i can hear my self keep saying i'm fighting for my life, sounds like depression. i went throught this in my early stages, but this time for my self, so i have to catch my self for my recovery,  page86
-3	negative	personality-disorder	I may be young but I have gone through a lot. I don't judge I try my best to look at not just one side and give an honest opinion. At the age of 17 I joined the military and got out at 23. So ask me advice or whatever you want I'll answer to the best of my ability.
-2	negative	personality-disorder	I'm back at it again. I scratch my skin till there's a large gash, which is more painful than what a razor can do. I know, I love you too- me
-5	negative	personality-disorder	I'm done. I'm cutting my wrist as much as I want this time and I'm running away. I can't take this anymore. This is too much. I am so done. I'm going to cut. & no one is going to see it cause I'll be gone. All these people are so mean. I can't take it anymore.
-17	negative	personality-disorder	i met a friend in my head who knows how many of them i have. he said there are many many. i dont know how many, there is only 62 i could count of. i drew their portraits for a whole night. he said there are some more. 88 he said. im just happy my theory of everyone having a pair is still true. i want everyone to be well and be there for each other. but this means that im alone. all alone. i think i am me. but i feel very very young. and i am mostly asleep for months at a time. its a bit hard to explain that i dont appear online for months. but there is history and it is full of things.. many many bookmark? from the others im sure. it seems that i share my computer with them. oh well i just wanted to say this is why i leave for so long for sometimes..
-1	negative	personality-disorder	Im going to find a razor and cut. Im sick of not having a release. I have no one to talk to. No savior.
-2	negative	personality-disorder	I'm going to keep going. ~Mina
-5	negative	personality-disorder	I miss my Layla so much, I all I really want to do is lay around and cry all day. I always try to put a smile on my face just so I won't worry my mom, but I feel so empty and alone. The only thing that would make me better is having my daughter. I just want to be with her, I wish someone will just kill me to take away this pain. I feel so horrible on a daily basis. I hate seeing pregnant women and babies, every time i see a baby or pregnant women when I'm out I literally run the other way.  I download all these baby apps just so I know what she would doing if she was here and all changes she would be going through. She will be 3 months on dec. 19.  I just don't know what to do anymore, I'm tired of hurting.
-9	negative	personality-disorder	I miss you every single day, every hour, every minute and even each second of my life. I can't stop think about you. Everything I do just reminds me about you. When I listen to music it just reminds me our best moments because the whole lyric talk almost the same we lived together. Even in my dreams you're with me but when I wake up is just a dream and it depresses me because I know we couldn't be together because of the distance but I wish some day I see you one more time 'cause I love you and I'm pretty sure you love me too I LOVE YOU!
-2	negative	personality-disorder	I'm my own worst enemy  This song describes me so well not joking
-4	negative	personality-disorder	I'm new here I'm Alexa I weigh 200 and I want a feeder to help me triple that :3
-7	negative	personality-disorder	I'm no stranger to loss. I've lost things, contacts, or friends. But I have especially experienced a lot of deaths. I've lost most of my closest friends and family over the years. By about a couple of years ago, all my best friends and closest friends from high school had died. (I'm just 33.) All my grandparents are gone, my father, many of my uncles and my closest ones, other good friends and neighbors, my pets, and in this age, some of my closest on line friends have passed away as well. My childhood sweetheart recently passed away. One of my cousins was murdered when she was about 21, we were the same age and had the same first name but were both called by shortened nicknames. My best friend and my cousins wife, who was a mother of six, both died waiting for transplants.
-4	negative	personality-disorder	I'm not a fatty but I'm trying to get over this one for good by eating mostly raw foods (fresh fruit and veggies, fish, chicken, and I would love to try grass-fed beef.
-7	negative	personality-disorder	I'm not a heavy smoker by any means,  I only really smoke 5 a day at the most, unless I'm particularly anxious and/or stressed. But I'm glad I started, when I light up I just feel the stress and anxiety melt away.  It has definitely helped me get through my anxiety.   and every time I light up, it's a nice little pleasure.
-8	negative	personality-disorder	I'm not really sure where I have stumbled now. Is this a world full of other INFPs? If so, it's good to find you, however we all got here. It's not always easy to express myself, at least in larger forums like the facebook infp group, where I know many people are not infps and don't really understand. I know it's a place to come together and bring understanding, but it's hard enough for us as it is sometimes with misunderstandings irl. Anyway, it is nice to find this wonderland.
-2	negative	personality-disorder	I'm not sure if this is just me or if other INFJ's are the same way ForeverAlone I guess~ lol :P
-6	negative	personality-disorder	Im not your average teen. Who is? I have tried to commit suicide, did self harm, ran away, and been in and out of hospitals since 12. Now i have gotten way better and am ready to share what i have been through and for all of the depressed teens who thinks nobody understands im here message me.
-3	negative	personality-disorder	i m on my way to defeat pure o. bcz i know i m morally activated
-5	negative	personality-disorder	im really craving to selp harm please someone help non of my friends understand please please please
-1	negative	personality-disorder	I'm sad and I have every right to be but the people around me don't think j should be sad. They tell me to straighten up and act my age. I don't have the right to express myself.
-2	negative	personality-disorder	I'm single and happy. But there have been days when I wished I wasn't single. Anyone out there who feels the same way? 
-8	negative	personality-disorder	I'm Summer:3 and I struggle with self-harm, bipolar disorder, severe depression, anxiety, and then a bunch of random health issues. Even though I have a lot on my plate I will help anyone who needs anything and I just want you to know that you are worth while:3  Love you guys c:
-6	negative	personality-disorder	I'm the kind of person who tries to see the good in everyone. I believe in second chances and redemption. I was brought up this way. I love the quote by Jim Morrison that some of his worst mistakes have been haircuts. I hope that's going to be my only mistake too. 
-7	negative	personality-disorder	I'm usually quiet but when I talk I can be the funniest person in the room. I guess it's because introverts observe people and we know what others think is going to be funny
-7	negative	personality-disorder	I need help. I need help from a mother. I'm sixteen and pregnant. I need help. If you're a mother, could you please PLEASE message me. I'm scared and I have no idea what to do.  Please someone message me.
-8	negative	personality-disorder	I need to know that there is hope, I've been lying for years and years. I am only 21 years old and I  I'm in an extremely serious relationship with a girl that literally means everything to me.. But of course lying has gotten in the way. Tonight she told me words meant nothing from me. Completely broke my heart because I couldn't blame her. I know I have a problem and I know I want to fix it. Please help, advice please. Thanks
-3	negative	personality-disorder	I need to put my 16+ year old yellow lab to sleep, should I bring his best buddy, also a 3 year old lab, to the vet with us to be apart of putting him down so he is aware of what's happening, and so he knows why we didn't bring the old one home? or will he understand? Any thoughts on this will be appreciated.I am going to do this Tuesday. Pray I have the strength. I will see all of my animals in heaven. Scott
-2	negative	personality-disorder	I need to share my story, I have been pretending to be a guy online for the past 5 years, I am a 21 year old white British woman but people think I am a 19 year old black American guy!!  By a lost cause.
-8	negative	personality-disorder	I never thought of myself as an introvert. I guess it all changed when I was young. I used to be able to talk to anyone but after I was dumped by my first girlfriend around the age of 11 it changed. Something as silly as that really seemed to change me though. I remember enjoying being around friends and groups and sharing stories, but ever since that day I've grown quiet and tired by people. I only like to have a few close friends and even a couple days with them is enough. I like my time alone and I don't like parties or being in big groups. I don't know if I like the way I am.
-5	negative	personality-disorder	In my place, people don't understand depression, nevertheless the disorder itself. It's almost like a taboo if your friend or relative has anything to do with mental disorder, so I stop myself from thinking that I am depressed. And after taking numerous self-tests (because I can't simply say I want to meet the doctor, I think there's something wrong with me) I do have MDD. P/s: during high school, i was mocked because of my body size and that was too, a depressing stage in my life.
-5	negative	personality-disorder	I noticed that i definitely act different in certain situations, environments and around different people. It would be nice to control it better and not let certain parts of a particular personality take over. Id like to be that charismatic and confident guy i am around family and friends when im talkin to a beautiful girl, and not so timid and shy
-7	negative	personality-disorder	I noticed there is a forum option on these Experience pages, but when I clicked on this one's, there were only 2 posts. Why is that? Why are we all on here if not to start a dialogue, and discuss things related to sociopathy or psychopathy with each other? Are we as diagnosed sociopaths really so characteristically narcissistic that we wish only to share our experiences, but without the desire for feedback or ongoing commentaries?  I was hoping to share and learn more about each other as people with this diagnosed 'disorder'. I want to know more about us, how we are alike, and how we are different - not just from each other, but from those who do not have ASPD. 
-6	negative	personality-disorder	In total, I have 10 brothers and sisters. I have 4 full blood siblings, 3 stepbrothers from my dad's wife, 1 step sister from my mom's husband, and a half brother and a half sister from my dad and step mom.  I know, it's a lot! It's pretty crazy. So in order of age it's Ashley, Natalie, Taylor, Kyle, Blake, Rachel (me), Lydia, Carson, Preston, Kate, and Nathan, making a total of 11. It seems like a lot, but unfortunately I rarely ever see Ashley, Blake, Carson, or Preston, and Kate and Nathan feel more like a nephew and niece than my siblings.  But yeah that's my family!
-6	negative	personality-disorder	Introversion"the state of or tendency toward being wholly or predominantly concerned with and interested in one's own mental life". An introvert is likely to enjoy time spent alone and find less reward in time spent with large groups of people, though he/she may enjoy interactions with close friends. Trust is usually an issue of significance: a virtue of utmost importance to introverts is choosing a worthy companion. They prefer to concentrate on a single activity at a time and like to observe situations before they participate.  Wikipedia  
-2	negative	personality-disorder	I officially stopped self harming. My mom found out and threatened to put me in an insane asylum..so I didn't wanna risk it. She does full body checks everyday. I'm officially done !(:
-3	negative	personality-disorder	I only got to hold my angel one day after he was born stillborn. Losing my child is the hardest thing I deal with everyday. I miss that little boy so much. He will always be my little superhero.  To read the full story of my pregnancy check out my story- Jakoby Anthony
-1	negative	personality-disorder	I realized that managing my BPD will be easier if I move out of state away from my family (including my BPD parents who refuse any sort of treatment). I went to grad school out of state and made so much emotional, spiritual and even physical progress in those 10 months, it was unbelievable. I regret allowing myself to be manipulated into coming back home. However, I will not live in regret and I'm ready to hit the restart button. Any other BPDs experience that moving away from home had a positive effect? I'd love to hear your stories.
-5	negative	personality-disorder	I really miss my mom. She passed away a few months ago. People are all like then why are you posting it? My dad cries a lot and I'm the only one in the family thats still strong. Mom took care of me and helped me with my bad dreams. My birthday here is fake, I'm actually 10. It's just that I can't tell anyone but I really need too. Here, I relate to people who have the same part of a story as I do. My mother died from a uncommon not contagious disease. Its not known like cancer or something. I really miss her.
-9	negative	personality-disorder	I recently found out I have OCD I lived with the little rituals and it was never super debilitating until I got into a relationship and it brought out some very bad insecurities mixed with intense OCD behavior. I think it contributed to the relationship ending but now I know I need help controlling my OCD. I would have never known how bad my obsessive thoughts could get if it weren't for this relationship and it's breakdown so I'm grateful for that!  I make strange noises, if I don't do something a certain way I'll think something bad will happen to someone I love, I obsess over questions and ask them over and over, and more! I can't believe I thought this was normal for so long.
-7	negative	personality-disorder	I recently read on this site.. I recently didn't even know that diagnosed existed. This past August from 3 diff hospitalizations, from diff hospitals, EEG, EKGs, blood work, MRI ,Cat scan, Spinal taps. Nothing, everything came back normal. I am happy that I am back its a long recovery, but with the right medications and therapy, I am back I am even driving. It took me about a month. 
-1	negative	personality-disorder	Is anyones airman in tech school for security forces? Or was?
-4	negative	personality-disorder	I self harm. No two ways about it. I've done it for months now. No one knows, no one notices, no one cares. Not my "friends" not my family, not my teachers. No one. I have done it on my thighs. And my left arm, although I haven't done it for about 2 weeks now I get urges every single day. I want this all to be over.
-4	negative	personality-disorder	I share more about myself online than in person. I find it difficult to share some things in person, even to my closest friends. It's just a lot easier to type some things out and have my friends read that.  
-1	negative	personality-disorder	I should have never have gotten married. 
-3	negative	personality-disorder	is it easier to gain control over just the one person  ,do you get more of a kick by being in a relationship with someone who is not as great as yourself do you prefer having someone there are they easier to manipulate because they "love" you ?  
-5	negative	personality-disorder	I started having bad arm pain in September and  was admitted to three hospitals this month. Not a single doctor could figure out why I was in such agony and pain in my arm, but began prescribing myself with pain killers, percocets, vicodin, morphine and muscle relaxers. So far I have been on them every day for a complete month now. Finally saw the last doctor and found  amoeba parasites in my blood stream. If I go a day without any painkillers I feel achey, chills and fever and once I take them again I feel completely normal. 
-7	negative	personality-disorder	I started watching Sassy Pants the other day. I didn't expect it to be so dead on. There were so many scenes that echoed my life exactly. The lines of the mother sounded like things my own mother would say to me.  I shouldn't have watched it alone, but I did anyways. I really could go into more detail about it, I just kind of don't want to. I just started crying halfway through and didn't really stop. 
-8	negative	personality-disorder	I still have her, sort of.. and it nearly came to not having her at all, March last year she tried commiting suicide, blamming it on me asking to move in with my dad and my sister who had her other reasons.. Anyway she had over dosed on so many pills that we were told we was lucky she was to be alive, 20-30 mins later and she definetly wouldn't have come through.. Anyway she spent her time in a mental health hospital for a month and then she came home.. But she's never been the same since. I still live with her being worried that if I leave she will do something stupid again, my dad has the same worries. She doesn't treat me like a son anymore which is Scary. 
-3	negative	personality-disorder	I suffer from mild anxiety and panic attacks when I am at school. My main triggers seem to be when some one is hurt or in pain (physically or emotionally) or in class if we are learning about something (eg hitler and the holocaust) that means people die or is upsetting. My class mates seem to be disturbed by this but not overly distressed.   I know my best friends are worried about me but I can't seem to want to eat at school, sure I'm hungry, I'm positively starving. But I'm so fat already, I don't need food.
-9	negative	personality-disorder	I suffer from panic attacks, especially when doing things like a presentation. My heart beats so fast that it's very hard for me to talk, I am surprised I have been able to even finish the speeches I have done. A few years back my condition was more severe, in some classes where there were people I didn't know I couldn't talk to them because I felt anxious and panicky. So I ended up isolated in those classes. Currently my panic attacks are not severe and it only happens when I'm not feeling well. It has been improving ever since I tried having conversations with more and more people, like customers at work.
-7	negative	personality-disorder	I take a deep breath and if I haven't cried by the end if the day it's a good day. I haven't cried yet today and I think I am doing ok
-3	negative	personality-disorder	I talk in the mirror having bee  convinced thats the only time that anybody hears me
-4	negative	personality-disorder	It describes me pretty well, I think. I was amazed when I first began reading about INFP. I don't think it's perfect or describes everyone who fits INFP perfectly, but I think it fits me pretty well. I've taken the test several times, and every time the result is the same.
-10	negative	personality-disorder	I think about my babies everyday. I sometimes hear them calling Mommy,or I hear there mischievous laughter. I'll never hold them again,never see them go off to school,get married,build a life of there own. 5 years have gone by but it seems like just a few day's ago I watched them go away for the last time. Sometimes in those brief moments between sleep and waking up,I can feel a gentle hug or a tender kiss. And for those brief moments my twins are here with me. Then I awake and know there gone.
-5	negative	personality-disorder	I think far too many people take me for granted and one day i want to disappear and then they will realize how much they took me for granted. People expect too much of me at times and i hate it. If i was't about would they miss me or just my presence?  I think my problem i care to much for others and not enough about myself. I think in life people do take other people for granted a lot, they don't appropriate others enough which is so sad, but i guess that is life!! x
-8	negative	personality-disorder	I think I am a pathological liar.  Naturally, when it was read out loud I knew that she was talking about me (the kleptomania part gave it away because we had coincidentally bought the same blanket but she couldn't find hers and because I couldn't find the receipt she thinks I took hers which I PROMISE I didn'tpetty and stupid, I know, but she took great offense to it and stole it from my room) and started analyzing the liar part. I knew I was prone to lying but it has gotten out of hand. I lie about my entire life and I want to stop. I'm not looking for someone to help me stop, I just need someone to share this with because I think just talking to someone and being able to tell them that I told a lie might help me. I really want people to be able to trust the words that are coming out of my mouth so now I've come here in hopes that I'll find someone who is also a liar and we can share with each other because after tons of research I am pretty sure that I am a pathological liar. 
-4	negative	personality-disorder	I think im disgusting and horrible and thinking im fat and hating the folds of fat on my body is just another way of loathing myself. This is the closest Ive ever been to the healthy weight range ( ive always been underweight) and I feel like an obeses person and disgusted at myself. I'm a disgusting pig I dont even deserve to eat I deserve nothing. I take up too much space.
-11	negative	personality-disorder	I think it is part depression and partly I dont know where to start. I started neglecting things, like cleaning and cooking. That turned into avoiding, even avoiding showering, moving or talking. I go through it in my head how I need to atleast try to start doing things again. But it never happens. Its like I cant find the motovation to move. I know what needs to be done and just wont make it happen. I feel stuck in this repetative cycle. Somedays ill pick things up and have a little energy, then others I dont want to deal with the world or my own thoughts. Not sure how to get out of this cycle of, being stuck, or lazy, or depressed, whatever it is, I cant get out.
-2	negative	personality-disorder	I think I've undergone some trauma
-3	negative	personality-disorder	I told myself if I didn't do anything I could cut at midnight on New Year's Eve. I celebrate 2014 with 2,014 cuts across the thigh, euphoric if you ask me.
-6	negative	personality-disorder	I try not to and usualy dont. I did it way to deep whn i was 16 and it really put me off and was so shame to go to the hospital and make up it was an accident. scars are ugly, i try and remember that.
-18	negative	personality-disorder	I try to always remember them both happy ,there laughter anduunending energy. But sometimes I can't help but think about how they died. The crooner swears they didn't suffer. But how can that be true? The boat capsized,caught in a horrific unpredicted storm. Did they know they were going to drown,did they struggle to survive? What horrors did they endure? Was my brother able to comfort them? Was he holding them close at the end? Or did it all end fast and swiftly? I pray that it happened to fast or at the very least my brother was with them holding them until the end. Sometimes these thoughts haunt me and I can't get them out of my mind.
-1	negative	personality-disorder	It's a constant battle. I'm dealing with it now, and not letting it control me 
-4	negative	personality-disorder	Its all so conflicting. People see me as a true extravert, i make friends easily and am usually the center of attention. It exhausts me though and for days after prolonged exposure to people i have self destructive behaviors. I will do everything to an excess such as eating, drinkng, and other binges.. Its awful. I cant find true balance, its absolutely bananas. Any other infj's going through this? We are only ONE PERCENT of the population.
-5	negative	personality-disorder	It's always been a battle to be quiet, shy while wishing I was more like all my outgoing friends. Over the years, I have learned to overcome or hide my introverted personality.  I still cringe when I must speak during business meetings or worse training sessions but I've learned to smile & pretend I'm outgoing! Now once I get to know someone - I never shut up!
-1	negative	personality-disorder	It's always nice to have someone to whom you can talk to without being judged.
-1	negative	personality-disorder	It's becoming stronger than me.
-2	negative	personality-disorder	It's been an ongoing on/off nightmare for as long as I've lived, but as of late, my situation has become even worse. 
-5	negative	personality-disorder	Its been in my nature most if not all of my life. Moderate socializing can be ok, but not great. too much can drive me crazy(er)! And I really prefer doing things on my own like playing games, reading, listening to music, drawing etc, ect Yeah, I'm just not a social specimen, but I'm kinda happy that way I guess C:
-3	negative	personality-disorder	It's funny, because as I was wondering about what to write on here I saw the picture for this group & became slightly annoyed. Go figure . . .
-9	negative	personality-disorder	It's pretty hard, viewing the world in a pessimistic way. I couldn't be more annoyed when I see that I've done something so well that it couldn't be better no matter how hard I tried, because no matter what I do it's imperfect. I've tried so hard to make myself presentable in society but can never be happy with how my life flows. It should be this way, or that way, and when I make it this or that way I still see room for improvement. This is normal, but the problem is that I see the need to act upon it. I fear this will be the death of me.
-8	negative	personality-disorder	It's still so hard.  I cry at the drop of a hat.  And ten minutes later I'm angry.  And then I'm just resigned to it all.  And it goes on and on.  It has only been four months since he died.  I guess I just feel like I am still swimming in sadness and grief and everyone else has moved on.  And they should, but I just feel so out of step with everyone else.   I'll deal with Christmas as it gets closer.  I hopel
-5	negative	personality-disorder	Its tough at times to be an introvert. We are out numbered & easily misunderstood because we prefer to think, dream, absorb & listen rather than verbalise about something that seems trivial to us.we are deep & appreciate what life is really all about.
-5	negative	personality-disorder	it totally ran my life.  But after a lot of time working on it, I was able to see through the issues and get the upper hand.  I still have to take care of myself or I can become susceptible to them again, but I think I finally am over these issues for good. So it can be done. have faith in yourself.
-16	negative	personality-disorder	It was first pointed out by my friend in school. I was young and i had no idea what it was at the time. She said asked "why do you always have to make it so perfect?" I just shrugged and then i ignored what else she had to say until i her the letters OCD. I asked her what that was and she told me "obsessive neatness disorder." (Ps. we were little i know its not the meaning.) So she said that people who have it has to make everything perfect or else it bothers them. I really didn't bother to look into it until middle school.
-9	negative	personality-disorder	It was pretty much entirely by choice: I made it impossible for my mother to keep me in school. I hated how alienated I felt there, and decided I'd rather be homeschooled than put up with feeling like a square peg trying to fit through a round hole. When people talk about their experiences with school and with friends, I feel left out. As the subtitle of this group says, it's like there's a void where the memories should be.
-5	negative	personality-disorder	I used to be self-conscious about who I was, because I didn't know who I was. I felt like many different people rather than one whole one. Perhaps all of the pieces together are the whole.  Turns out I'm a jack of all trades.
-6	negative	personality-disorder	I used to cut myself with knives, scissors, even staples to just distract myself for a little while My parents and family started getting suspicious about the cuts and I'd lie and say my cat did it with her claws but the lie stopped working after a while. I stopped cutting although the urges were still there. They were so hard to control. I don't know how I managed to go so long without cutting, but I did. Every time I'm depressed or have the urge, I let my cat do it for me. My parents and family believe me now and so does all my friends. Sometimes I wish I could just stop though
-4	negative	personality-disorder	i used to self harm but the brother of my friend stoped me, he is overprotective now, is nice but he is like a policeman, not like my friend :S
-3	negative	personality-disorder	I used to self harm. It was a 4 year addiction. I went to treatment for it and then recently i relapsed. 
-3	negative	personality-disorder	I've always been a nervous person. Even as apreschooler I always felt like people would abandon me if I didn't pelase them, do what ever they say. When someone is mad at me I just want to hide in my room. I always have this naucious feeling. I can never eat much and get anerexic sometimes. Sometimes I just want to run away from everything 
-4	negative	personality-disorder	I've always been one of those children that could entertain myself, because I have a vivid imagination, and even as a grown up, I still use my imagination a lot. I am an introvert, and still quite proud of it.
-1	negative	personality-disorder	I've always been really clingy and I love the feeling if being wanted and important.. I'm only 15, and when I get a boyfriend, I don't want to be too clingy .-. ugh
-1	negative	personality-disorder	I've always kinda been an introvert.  If your an introvert  message me(:
-6	negative	personality-disorder	I've been clean from any cut in 3 years.Okay,thats a lie.Ha.The truth is I rarely cut now.I do wish I can cut a lot like last time but reality is difficult.I have a job now.But it makes me sad when I dont have any real friends.The thing is I dont need to cut myself because the lonely is slowly killing me.Just triple times slower than cutting my wrist.I can still remember the first time,I started to do it.It turned out,I'm addicted to it until I can't stop.Once you start to cut,you barely stop.Plus razors are cheaper than any drugs.Just saying
-6	negative	personality-disorder	I've been going through some particularly difficult times at the moment in the usual infj ways but it always gives me so much comfort to rediscover my infj-ness here and it makes me remember that it's a pretty unique and special world to inhabit.  at times it can be hard not to despair and become caught up with the endless anxiety and suffering we stir up in ourselves but knowing there are others out there who just get like me is pretty wonderful 
-6	negative	personality-disorder	I've been introverted for as long as i can remember. It used to make me really depressed because i just wanted to be like everyone else. But now I've come to accept that it's just who i am. 
-9	negative	personality-disorder	Ive been living this world for 34 years and im just now excepting reality. But who can really say what reality is? Is reality what you can see, hear, touch and taste? Those are some, but what about the thoughts and feelings that are attached to them? Yaw . Everyone just wants to be accepted. If we could just all realize we are all in this together. And not just out for 'number 1', 'reality' would be a better place.
-2	negative	personality-disorder	I've been struggling with cutting myself for awhile now. I'm planning on doing it tonight too. );
-3	negative	personality-disorder	Ive been surrounded by extroverts who doesnt have principle let alone the decency to try and understand someone. Half of these people appear morons to me whose only ideal in life is move on, which is also an excuse to cover up guilt, idiocy, helplessness and the incapability to do stuff. If the whole world moved on without struggling to achieve greatness, we'd still be in stone age moving on from one stone to another. Thank you. I'm an analyst, experienced in psychology, helpful, dependable, open minded and these are also the reason that makes me regret my current situation as my demise is due these qualities of mine. 
-5	negative	personality-disorder	I've been told that when it comes to looks, smarts, & brains, I'm above average, so then why is it that no matter how much I go out of my way to do good for those around me; all I get is hated by trolls, mocked by the criminal, and harassed on Facebook? Is falsly destroying someones reputation, seriously that much of a past time?
-5	negative	personality-disorder	I've come to realize this with my friends they are like sisters to me we finish each others sentences we are very close 
-1	negative	personality-disorder	I've cut for almost 4 years
-1	negative	personality-disorder	i've done it this time, i've pushed him away, he hates me, he wasn't supposed to find out, and now he hates me. i don't deserve to have someone like him there. hes never going to talk to me again, i am a failure, why can i never do things right? 
-16	negative	personality-disorder	I've had panic attacks for about 3 years now. My parents brought me to about 50 doctors, a shrink, a hypnotist! And I'm now on my second psychologist! I'm after missing about 2 full years of school work (which included state examinations, I passed all exams but only barley). I have had home school but I get home schooled in school? It's like in a small room with me and my teacher. I just got prescribed Meds  from my psychologist. They are starting to work and I'm going to half of my classes! The problem is I can't rid myself of the feeling that everyone is staring at me, judging me or talking about me. I can't bring it up with my friends because I'm afraid that they will think I'm self centred. I know this post is pointless but it's just a few things I needed to get if my chest.
-2	negative	personality-disorder	I've lost two family members to cancer. One of my aunts and one of my uncles. Recently, another aunt has been diagnosed. Its spread too far too quickly and they don't think she'll make it much longer.  I almost don't want her to, its hard to see her in so much pain. I'd love to see her reunited with her brother and sister, free of any pain.
-6	negative	personality-disorder	I've never cut myself deep enough to leave scars, it's not that I don't want to, I'm just frightened.  Lately I've been using safety pins, keys, and my own nails to create cuts and once they are there I enjoy looking at them every once in a while.  I've tried to stop but when something goes bad it is an automatic reaction for me. I like having the marks there, it reminds me that I can control something even if it isn't healthy for me.  My boyfriend tells me to stop and that it makes him sad when I do it, and I've tried to stop, for him, but I can never manage to.  I'm disappointed in myself that I can't stop, which makes me cut more.
-7	negative	personality-disorder	I've only been newly diagnosed and my life suddenly makes sense although the complexity of PTSD scares me. My trauma is not what has been done to me rather the powerless I felt watching people I love suffer My dad died when I was 14 then my mum and brother took it pretty hard them my younger brother died also I can't explain how hard it is to watch someone die, u never forget it. I isolate myself though I can be quite sociable but never let people in, it's made me feel very alone. 
-2	negative	personality-disorder	I've recently noticed how everyone yells at you when you are completing an OCD ritual. Why do they do this to us? It is candidly upsetting or frustrating or something to them when they see us do our OCD things like that?
-12	negative	personality-disorder	Ive suffered with the effects of BPD for years without knowing what it was. Just recently got diagnosed and it all made sense to me why i am the way i am. More recently ive noticed that cannibis helps me to slow down my reaction time so that i dont reach angry and violent. I can focus on the emotion that triggers the anger and deal with that. I can also use humor and satire to ease the tension and relax, so i don't hurt the people in my life that i care about. I am a solid supporter of medicinal marijuana for BPD symptoms. But i still maintain an understanding that counselling and therapy (DBT) is a better way to get to the root of the problem. I am currently trying to find a doctor who can understand this and help me to get a medicinal user card in my area.
-3	negative	personality-disorder	I've tried multiple times and been saved by multiple different people &lt;3 thanks to anyone who has helped me get thru my struggles. I am often selfish but people need to understand the hurt I go thru
-2	negative	personality-disorder	I want somme help my life ils awful
-5	negative	personality-disorder	I want to cut so bad but I can't because of a doctor appointment in a few weeks it won't heal in time. It's a melanoma check cause my dad has it and its something that can be genetic. So they are gonna check every inch if my body  all I want is to bleed a little
-10	negative	personality-disorder	I want to start by saying that I actually do not know if I am a shopaholic, but I am starting to feel that way. For me it is not even about latest fashion. I do not care about shoes, clothes or anything like that. For me it is about collecting My Little Ponies. I see ones I love and I have to figure out how to get it. I have run up my credit card, have been half truthful about it with my husband, and I feel guilty, but then I do not want to part with them. I have sold some as a promise to my hubby about it, but I am now looking at trying to buy them back, but more expensive versions I never used to be this way. I used to absolutely refuse to buy myself anything. My husband used to encourage me to buy something, used to tell me it is ok to buy myself something with the money I earn. I finally did and now I am hating myself for it, because I cannot stop myself
-8	negative	personality-disorder	I was about I think 3 or 4 years old when I was placed in foster care. My siblings and I were placed together, sometimes seperately depending on who was with who home alone at the time. My parents would leave us home alone in apartment from time to time and didn't care. I can't talk for them because my father passed away but they had to both work to take care of 5 children in a small apartment. My dad was a landscaper and didn't know anyone that would babysit us so they left us home alone. I finally got to talk about it with my mom and she felt bad for leaving us and that she didn't know the laws in America or knew a lot of English. I still feel kind of resentful but I still don't feel like right about it for some reason. 
-2	negative	personality-disorder	I was a week clean but I relapsed. I noticed with school and all, cutting my wrist will draw attention so I messed up my thighs. I feel like this is the only escape.
-20	negative	personality-disorder	I was diagnosed with Conversion Disorder last April. It started when I confessed to my friend and parents about my severe depression. The stress and anxiety from saying it caused me to catch a virus. I started getting pains in my body but the doctor thought it was a virus so I brushed it off. Next week I went back to school and during homeroom I realized I was getting weak. Everything around me was slowing down. It felt like there was 100 lbs on my body. I had my friend walk me to the nurse and by the time I got home I couldn't walk. That's how I stayed for a monthon my couch paralyzed from shoulder down. My parents drove me to the emergency room and then I went to CHOP and they diagnosed me with Depression, Anxiety and Conversion Disorder.  Since then I've done months of physical therapy and DBT to start coping but I still deal with paralysis in my left side and weakness in my right and pains. I figured since its my first time posting might as well tell my story. 
-16	negative	personality-disorder	I was diagnosed with OCD at the age of 52.  The stress of a mid-life career change had blown apart the fragile peace I had with the condition exposing a life lived as one rut or routine after another.  When I started taking medication, it was almost like starting a new life.   The patterns, rituals, and intrusive thoughts had gone on for so long that they were simply an everyday part of my life's landscape. As many of you living with OCD know, medication is only a part of the treatment.  Therapy is helping me put together the puzzle pieces of my life's motivations.  Ultimately, the satisfaction of facing into my OCD and staring it down has been extremely empowering.  The road to recovery may be long, but I've covered a lot of ground. 
-8	negative	personality-disorder	I was in a relationship with a guy, and he asked me to send him a picture. Well one wasn't good enough, he wanted to see more and more until I sent him fully explicit pictures of myself. I didn't get any enjoyment out of it, and I'm lucky my parents never found out. He was over 18 and I was a minor, he could've gotten into serious trouble with the law. Sometimes it is hard to say no to somebody, especially if you love them. But you shouldn't do anything you are not comfortable doing. Just learn to say no! 
-9	negative	personality-disorder	I was never this way until I got into a serious relationship. When I was single, I loved sleeping alone in "my" bed. I had a queen sized bed and it was more than enough space for me. I loved sleeping in the middle and had more than enough room to stretch out. I hated when he would stay over because we didn't fit in the bed comfortably. He's much taller than me and would hoard the covers and leave me squished in a little corner! Now that we have a house together and we have "our" own king sized bed I can't sleep without him! I've grown comfortable laying next to him each night. I usually can't sleep if he's not next to me. Oh the irony.
-2	negative	personality-disorder	I was prescribed Xanax when I was 15 years old and from that moment on my full on addiction had begun. Stealing, lying, cheating, fighting. I've been through it all. From suicide attempts to probation. I am now happy to say I have an entire year clean from this drug. Message me if you need help or someone to talk to
-3	negative	personality-disorder	I was reading some stories within my groups when I opened up my list of groups and noticed something rather disturbing. I belong to both Flo
-8	negative	personality-disorder	I was verbally abused by peers and teachers all through elementary and in 7th grade I had enough. I told only one person that I was going to kill myself but that one person saved my life. She was scared for me so she told the school counsuler. Today I suffer from the things they said. I have depression, anxiety, and aggressiveness towards people who didn't do anything wrong including children. Life is hard emotionally still but I just need to stay positive.
-2	negative	personality-disorder	I watched the months before. Why did it have to happen to us?
-1	negative	personality-disorder	I went to a brazilian coffee shop ( usual spot), got large coffee black no sugar and 3 bread rolls, walked to a chill pot, read a book, smoked a cig or 2. just chilled. with winter coming guess i can invest in some snow gear and do it up. 
-1	negative	personality-disorder	I went to my consular the a day or to a go and  sead   I  mite have multiple personalities.  How do u fix that can u be came bedder my life sound like a never ending fix of pills more I talk the more I walk dead , dead same time I wish I could stop death but when he cames I will great him like a old friend
-1	negative	personality-disorder	I wish more people knew or at least would be understanding of anxiety. I'm not just whiney. I'm not just nervous. I'm not just complaining. It is real in the physical aspect. It has a physical pain to it. It hurts. I can't stay still. And I feel like my body is being torn apart. Just because you can't see what's wrong doesn't mean nothing is there. Know that.
-2	negative	personality-disorder	I write my stories in a blog.  I would love to get some comments or suggestions from fellow introverts.   Www.theintrovertsociety.blogspot.com
-5	negative	personality-disorder	I wrote in a blog on how I identified the person I created as P and the person that P had a relationship is N. I hope that's understandable.  And I haven't gotten an email since early this morning, and they said they wanted P. And nothing since. I really don't know what to do.
-3	negative	personality-disorder	January 8, 2000 was the worst day of my life. I lost my daughter that day due to complications. My life was changed dramatically that night. Nothing hurts more than having to bury your baby. It's forever engraved in my mind. 
-4	negative	personality-disorder	Just had a panic attack. That thing hurts. It's time to make a trip to the doctor bc they are getting worst. I felt it in my chest n I began trembling
-2	negative	personality-disorder	Just wondering if anyone on here an help me out. I just want to feel like me again 
-2	negative	personality-disorder	Kinda, it depends on what I am doing if I  one or not lol
-5	negative	personality-disorder	Large groups of people generally annoy and drain me. It's probably why I like chatting one-on-one or in small groups. I like to feel like I know the person a little better.
-2	negative	personality-disorder	Last night I thought I was going to burst. Everything was closing in on me. I was so close to cutting but I didn't. I haven't for a while and I don't want to lose.
-4	negative	personality-disorder	Like another person wrote on here, why does anxiety strike when you are looking forward to something good in the future? It doesn't make any sense, but yet, it kinda does.  I'm going to be the change I want to see in the world by embracing my new life of love ahead!
-8	negative	personality-disorder	Like some introverts, I have difficulty establishing boundaries with others in relationships. My biggest issue was an over willingness to compromise in order to placate others. I was the type of person that was very vulnerable to manipulation or emotional blackmail. An example would be my ex-wife. I hate conflict and generally will do anything to avoid a fight and my ex-wife was well aware of this fact and regularly incorporated it into her relationship strategy with me. If there was some place that I didn't want to go or we were arguing about money, she knew that she could "win" the argument just by getting more and more visibly enraged. She would shout louder and louder until I caved in and did whatever she wanted. It took me many years, but eventually I freed myself from that relationship and ultimately from that crippling mindset. 
-1	negative	personality-disorder	Me: "You know what my problem is? I have too many quirks." Because apparently we don't believe in pillsor therapy.
-2	negative	personality-disorder	Mind numb, body numb. That what my razor does. What does yours?
-9	negative	personality-disorder	most people say if you cut your stupid but in my opinion I believe they can't say that unless they have been there and done it tem selves. I have cut for a while in my life and it does help to stop the pain and the feeing tat everyone and everything hates you. I'm not saying that it is a good thing to do because it hurts you I know it helps you and it helps me but remember no matter what there are people out there that care about you. 
-1	negative	personality-disorder	My beautiful youngest daughter Amy died suddenly on Sunday, August 4.  Her viewing is tomorrow!  I am in such unbelievable pain and can't imagine how I will get through the next few days of viewing, mass and burial plus life w/o her! How do I function in the world and mother my other 2 kids and be a good wife to my husband?  Please help me to have hope I can go on after this I don't know how to accept the death of my sweet baby who is only 27!
-8	negative	personality-disorder	My best friend Ryan committed suicide 2 weeks ago yesterday. He's always been depressed  and talked about it endlessly so I can't say it was a huge shock but it still hit me pretty hard..I'd never been to a funeral or even seen a corpse before and I had to be one of the pall bearers and give his eulogy..We also worked together so it's been tough not seeing him. He was a good man who always put everyone else ahead of himselfI was sad at first..then angryat him and myself for not being able to do anythingI know he was in a lot of pain and I'm hoping now wherever he is, or isn't, he's at peace. I'll miss you Rye guy.
-5	negative	personality-disorder	My blood family has never meant much to methey don't feel like family My friendsthey are my family. I've got a mother, father, brothers, sisters
-8	negative	personality-disorder	My brother is dating a controlling girlfriend and I hate her so much, she talks to much crap about people, she told me she lost respect for me because I played a song, she told me I was worthless, and she says I need to grow up because I tell my grandma that my brother and her are always on top of each other in his bed. I'm so sick of her..
-11	negative	personality-disorder	my cat Cutu was 8 years old. she was my everything. i never knew how painful losing your best friend would be, until 3 months ago.  i still have such insane guilt. my family thinks im over it but i still cry myself to sleep. i still have super bad days where i just sit and stare and imagine if i didnt feed her that morning, she would still be beside me. i would always say "if she died i dont know what i would do" i really have no idea what to do. im sad, lonley, and feel that if i tell someone all they would do is not care or just give me the "shes much happier up there" when really i pray to god she is because thats whats holding me up. all my friends dont care. i also dont want them to worry. and my family thinks everythings all peachy when really i feel like *. i just hope everything will be ok eventually. 
-6	negative	personality-disorder	my curious ways is what lead me to find out my personality type in the first place. very quiet ,intelligent, artsy and I enjoy my own company very much. that's me in a nut shell, always find that people find it difficult to understand me. glad to find people like me
-2	negative	personality-disorder	My English teacher get really frustrated when I start roping pages out of my book because the writing isn't neat or I'm not happy with the  grade standard Its so bad that everything I'm my room is colour coordinated
-2	negative	personality-disorder	My father is one. That's why I know so many of you so well. Self centered to the extreme. Why you do what you do, your pain and why you spread it. What sad creatures you are.
-4	negative	personality-disorder	My father, paternal uncle and paternal grandmother have bipolar, as does of my sisters. In my early childhood I was always quiet and introverted, but was happy and well-adjusted. By the time I was 7-8 years old I suddenly withdrew from others and gained a lot of weight. I was very neurotic. At age 12 I occasionally became wild, running around the house and terrorizing my siblings and I didn't know why.  I hope that all those who are affected by such a disorder might be able to find positive support and help, through professional help and positive support from others the way I have.
-8	negative	personality-disorder	My friend, you are one of the smartest guys I know. But there are a few things I need to tell you. If you think it doesnt hurt to not talk to you, youre wrong. If you think my heart doesnt ache to see you and not say anything, youre wrong. If you think I dont notice when you log on and off, youre wrong. If you think that I dont stare at your name, hoping youll just say hi, hoping somehow, you can understand what I'm thinking, youre wrong. Me
-10	negative	personality-disorder	My girlfriend and I were spending the weekend together at my camper down the shore. We had a long day driving four hours to meet her family at the beach to go home and have a break down and a panic attack. We were talking over dinner about my struggles and my disorder. She said,"you make me sad and I cry every night from the fear of losing you that has lately, been consuming me." At that moment through the whole conversation, I wanted to cry. I have become so numb that I rarely cry. That night I ran into the bathroom and repeatedly smashed my head on the mirror as tears streamed down my face creating a puddle of regret on the sink counter. I've never felt so much pain and regret in my life than I did in those moments as I popped more pills and left. 
-8	negative	personality-disorder	My hole life I have felt as if I'm living two different lives. At school I've always been the smart, quite, and a tomboy of a girl. I never were anything but baggy jeans, a T-shirt, sneakers, and the same jacket. Whale when I any where but at school I am the dumb blonde that never shuts up, and wears tight shorts and a low cut tank top. Now this would be fine if it weren't for the problem that I'm only living half of each life, neither up to their highest capability. They both fit me, but I have to stop living two lives. Any advice?
-10	negative	personality-disorder	My life growing up was very much like the one you see in the movie Mermaids with an emotionally reclusive and very promiscuous Mother. She had many men and relationships while I was a child and neither I nor my two younger brothers have the same father. In my case she was in her early twenties and had just gotten divorced when she met my father. They had a short relationship together when she became pregnant with me, and he bailed on her when she asked to get married. 
-1	negative	personality-disorder	My life has been clouded by a series of negative events that were the result of me getting frustrated because things weren't done to my satisfaction.  I've learned to not trust others to do things correctly/accurately.
-8	negative	personality-disorder	My mind often travels back to this thought that i will never be loved. People always say that looks don't matter, but who in their right mind would want to love or even have a crush on a chub like me. And i always want to lose the weight, buts its extremely hard. They make it look easy on shows like The Biggest Loser, but losing weight involves a lot of hard work and dedication, and i don't have that
-11	negative	personality-disorder	My mom and two of my siblings are borderline. None of them are willing to get help for it. And they feed off from each other on a daily basis. Unfortunately I am disabled and very dependent on them for help day to day. I try to find ways to separate myself from them (activities outside of the home) but because of my condition, I can no longer drive very often on my own so it is pointless to have my own car. My mom is very manipulative about allowing me to use hers. Things like this (as I am sure anyone here can contest) is what just adds to my daily stress of having to deal with them. The thing is they all act like they don't even seem to care that I am very sick and the way they act is making me worse. I don't know what to do. I've tried going to therapy, reading books. I think the only way I am going to get away from them is if I get into a relationship but its hard enough to date when you aren't sick
-6	negative	personality-disorder	My mom is amazing.  She's an inspirational lady.  She's fought cancer and is in remission.  She gives, and gives, and gives.  I'm very blessed to have her in my life and am so very thankful we've been able to grow close again after all the BS I pulled as a teen and despite my ex's underhanded attempts to isolate me from my family.
-2	negative	personality-disorder	My mother hung herself when I was five. It's not fair that it's my only memory of her.
-14	negative	personality-disorder	My name is Humphrey and I am 79 years old. I am married to a woman who loathes me for what I have become. I made terrible financial decisions, which have resulted in bad real estate purchases, and I blame others for them. The only thing I know to do well in life is to lie. I make up situations in my mind that are not true. I cause scenes when I go out to eat at a restaurant in order to have my meal given to me for free. I make purchases then file claims on my credit card claiming the items are broken or defective in an attempt to receive money back. My family wants nothing to do with me, but I do not see myself stopping my constant, habitual lying. I am not sure I even want to.
-3	negative	personality-disorder	My name is Jerrica and I'm 20 years old. Like most of you, I've been lying nearly my entire life. It started when I was little and just snowballed into something much, much bigger. 
-2	negative	personality-disorder	My nephew died tragically 14 months ago, he was 17! I miss him & the whole family has been devastated because if his death.  My dad died 6 months to the day that he died so it's been very difficult dealing with all of this!!
-1	negative	personality-disorder	My non-epiliptic seizures are winning again!!!
-1	negative	personality-disorder	My one and only big brother. My hero. My childhood best friend. It is so hard to get up in the morning knowing I will never see him again and even though it has almost been a year and a half i am completely broken without him. It gets hard to breathe when I hear his name and I wake up with tears running down my face every single night. I would do anything to have my big brother back because this hurts so bad.  
-11	negative	personality-disorder	My son is 4 years old. He has difficulty listening. I tell him over and over and try different ways of saying it to make it fun, but it's a constant job. He needs constant attention it seems and I have a two year old that is very calm, able to self entertain ect. They ate polar opposites. my four year old gets very hyper at night right before bed and needs melatonin to go to sleep. We have tried everything to get him to sleep without medication. It takes him hours. Do with the doctors approval we give him a small dose. He had a very difficult time having down time or playing by himself. He's very loud. I understand that these behaviors are normal for a four year old. But it's constant for him. It's getting to a point that my patience run very thin and I have to use the mommy voice. He feels i'm being mean and hurtful. I just don't know what to do. Does he have sound like your children with adhd? Advice on what the first signs were and what you did?
-3	negative	personality-disorder	My therapist mentioned medication for the first time today. Specifically Prozac. I'm nervous but interested in living a life that isn't obsessivewhat's your experience with medication or have you found other ways of dealing?! Thanks
-1	negative	personality-disorder	My uncle get's on my nerves so badly. Just the prescence of him
-1	negative	personality-disorder	need to be on my own a lot at times. I cant stand the party girls. the loud awful music of my generation. some people say im an old soul. partys i find, are crap, especially house partys. always the group of girls wanting the attention of 50 different guys in there lives, and guys need to show off how much of a man they are. i see it all the time. im 22 now , ive just gotten tired of it, people acting like fools when drunk, people getting sick. even just doing other things that does not involve partying like going off with so many other people for concerts can be tiring. i need to do my thing to feel happy. its who i am.  i cant change that. 
-16	negative	personality-disorder	Nobody is pure in any sense; each individual is divided into separate traits, and I'm far from exempt of this fact. There are some aspects of myself that I'm quite proud of, but there are also traits that I must be defined with begrudgingly. My entire being is simply a spectrum of different states of mind. Some traits are traits I'm honored to call my own, while others are impurities in a personal reality I'm forced to accept. Despite this, however, these are my characteristics. Some developed later than others, but as of today, the different sections of an individual's conscious that I've described for all who read this passage are the traits that define me. It's thanks to these traits that I've had the experiences which fill my history, and those experiences are what strengthened or weakened my characteristics. I can't change my past, so I can't change myself. Whether I like it or not, the traits that define me right now will remain true throughout my life.
-3	negative	personality-disorder	No. FAMILY IS FAMILY. Being blood with someone MEANS NOTHING. It drives me CRAZY. I only like my aunt and uncle. That's it.
-2	negative	personality-disorder	No one ever likes me at first glance. they think I'm 'Weird' and 'Annoying' and 'Nosey' and 'Creepy' and 'Negative'. good luck, infps!
-2	negative	personality-disorder	No one is perfect but some people can really rock their imperfections very well. It makes me happy to know that I am one of those people xD
-13	negative	personality-disorder	No parent should ever have to bury there child. There is no amount of tears or time that heals. If it weren't for my other son who was barely 5 at the time I think I would of fallen completely apart. I went to counseling for over 3 years and while it has helped me tremendously, I know nothing will ever heal me completely. Some days I swear I can hear there laughter and there voices calling Mommy,I catch glimpses of them in the features of my other two children. I won't ever stop mourning them or my brother. One day we'll all be together again. 
-1	negative	personality-disorder	Nothing good ever comes from a bucket. That is all there is there to say. 
-4	negative	personality-disorder	Nothing irritates me more than a family member who thinks they are better than everyone else or their opinion matters more. Grr grr & grr
-4	negative	personality-disorder	not in a despressed/sucidal way. im genuinely wondering what is the point? what am i contributing that is so important that i need to live? it would not effect anyone if i was dead so im curious. i dont really do anything or have any talents??? so i dont understand why im even living????? like why?
-3	negative	personality-disorder	Now 48 and on the eve of my mother's 75th birthday, after a week of volatile family strife, I can now definitively say that I am the child of a borderline parent. I dabbled in the issue a few years back, but I think I was too caught up in understanding my own depression (now conquered for the most part) to absorb this diagnosis. Why does realization creep in so slowly?  
-3	negative	personality-disorder	I was never bullied until I reached High School, my first experience with other children my age. I feel like this describes the experience pretty well.
-1	negative	personality-disorder	Oh how my heart aches today! When are you going to figure this out?
-1	negative	personality-disorder	Oh man don't even get me started.I have it so bad. I worry about everything, little things bother me. Like I even have my shirts color coordinated. Yes I know crazy right. I even save all my gum wrapperswell most of them that is. It's pretty crazy lol. But I wouldn't change me for nothing (:
-4	negative	personality-disorder	Oh, people tend to love me. At first. But it does seem the more someone gets to know me, the less they like.. or maybe I just get boring.. I'm not sure.
-3	negative	personality-disorder	Oh yeah! I would say that my step mom is strict. I have to wash up, clean my room, clean the bath and shower, make my own bed, and I'm in bed by 7pm every night.
-4	negative	personality-disorder	OK. So I'm now worried. I fear my ocd is getting worse. I was just coloring and I'm having a freakout cause my black marker died. Leaving parts of it black, parts of it faded black. Its making my skin crawl thinking bout it now. Now also the noise of it is too much for me to handle. On top of THAT I dropped 3 pencils on the floor and involuntarily gasped. Not from shock but from seeing them fall of a chair that I organized them on.  Can tourrettes be suddle? Cause I've been gasping and, best I can describe it as a , ' hut' sound for about 3 weeks. My dad keeps telling me to ' stop' or ' knock it off' but I can't and I'm frustrated and scared to go back to school with it. What can I do to help it?!?! D:
-2	negative	personality-disorder	OK so I'm typing this one handed and I'm stuck. I have a toy house that has two red doors. They make a small click every time it opens and closes. I can't stop. I can't remove myself from this situation. How do I stop this for future reference?! D:
-4	negative	personality-disorder	One might also consider this as OCD. To me, I get bothered if specific little things aren't perfect. Not everything mind you, only very specific things. I have a hard time understanding exactly what these things are, and why I am only this way about a specific few things, but I do feel this way nonetheless.
-2	negative	personality-disorder	one might argue we're not that valuable.  so you have to ask yourself: where does your control begin and end ? do you even have any kind of control ?
-5	negative	personality-disorder	One of the hardest things to deal with when trying to overcome panic and anxiety is knowing what to do with all that excess energy. I know when I used to get my panic attacks it sometimes felt like I just wanted to jump right out of my skin! My heart would race at a thousand beats per minute and I thought one day it just might literally shoot out of my chest. Of course my hypochondria only made it worse because I was convinced I could have a heart attack at any moment. 
-4	negative	personality-disorder	Only in my adult years did I report as INFP. Previously it was enfp. I definitely feel introverted but I'm not sure the INFP profile always fits me. I read thy INFPs wear rose coloured glasses. Instead, I feel like I see the pain of the world too easily. I overthink things and I'm always grass is greener, thinking of the next big thing.  Anyone else experience this?
-7	negative	personality-disorder	On the computer, it's a lot different, but in real life speaking to another person is so difficult that I just don't even try, really. I'll never initiate a conversation with someone I feel is a stranger. They talk first or it's just going to be awkward silence from there on. And even when they talk, I just don't say much. I have a tendency to stumble over my words and not have the ability to clearly think as I speak and I'm one of those blushers that has their whole face light up like a Christmas light so I just stare at the table the entire time. I've been ridiculed by my family on occasion for my fairly anti-social behavior. I get the feeling they just tease and don't seriously mean it, but for them to laugh at me for my fears hurts. I'm afraid of messing up a conversation, for being too afraid to carry it out, for being worried they'll reject me for a lot of reasons.
-9	negative	personality-disorder	On the days when I'm feeling great, I feel so blessed to be an infj. I know that being an infj is a blessing despite the roller coaster of emotions experienced, but sometimes I just get tired of dealing with myself once "burnout" (as one poster put it) hits. Burnout feels so horrible  Do other infj's feel that way? Do you feel tired of the major ups and downs? Feel tired of being on the Mt. Everest of Joy and Success and then in while in the Marianas Trench of disconnectedness and hopelessness? Yes, I know there are a lot of different things here. My mind is pinging and a lot of stuff stressing me out. 
-2	negative	personality-disorder	Pain lets me know im still alive .
-2	negative	personality-disorder	Parents are divorced since I was 10. I'm an only child too.  - what do you think of my life?
-14	negative	personality-disorder	Part of myself is in the past and the other part is in the present . The conception of reality is broken down into fragments, seeing things that could of been and that has been. I live in both realities but one is consuming me, unable to breath, threw the confinements that is self-pity and denial. My past is what made me who I am I try not to live in it but it's lives in me. Don't dwell in the past, for that has already happened,  learn from the past and take what you have learned and use it to live in the present, and to create a future. Don't hide behind covers that's already been torn.
-1	negative	personality-disorder	People drain introverts. This is one main truth. Doesn't mean I'm shy! Far from it.  However most introverts have a personal downtime equation. Mine: One night out with friends = a solid month of me time. Daily job (super high energy disgustingly friendly high tech environment) = most weekends home ordering my groceries online so I don't have to experience humanity for 2 glorious days.  But if you catch me on my quarterly night out you are guaranteed awesome times. ;-)
-7	negative	personality-disorder	People would never think I was an introvert unless they know me very well.  I have had to learn to pretend to be extroverted because of my jobs.  In work settings, being an introvert has always been a liability.  Introspection doesn't count for much I guess, when there is a bottom line and a reputation to keep. I am always afraid that people will think I am a snob or that I don't like them.  It's just so hard for me to remember faces and names, unless I connect on a really personal level.  I like just about everyone, if I can remember who you are.  
-6	negative	personality-disorder	Perhaps my favorite film of all time, "Excalibur" was my introduction to Arthurian lore when I was a child, soon to followed by T.H. White's book "The Once and Future King." I'm bringing up "Excalibur" here because John Boorman (director) and Nigel Terry (actor) so obviously present Arthur as an introvert thrust into a extroverted role. When he first draws Excalibur and Merlin tells him that he's the rightful king, he literally runs from it all, out into the woods to reflect and recharge. As the boy king, he's wide-eyed, intense and unassuming. As a grown man, he's thoughtful and serious.

-3	negative	personality-disorder	Practically ever weekend during my high school years. It's been close to 6 years now since I've done them. Each time was a whole different experience. I've been on plenty "vision quests". Good times.
-1	negative	personality-disorder	Prozac? Does it help? Thank you
-5	negative	personality-disorder	Realised that I have Pure O! There is an article in The Independent today about a girl with Pure O, it made me smile and afforded me a little relief whilst hearing of her condition. 
-6	negative	personality-disorder	Recently, i have found out that all of my suspicions were, for the most part, true. He was most definitely sneaking around, lying and i am almost positive that the situations i thought he may have cheated, he did. I mean, you dont hang out ALONE with an old fling buddy, take pictures of her naked, wearing your necklace, and not do anything.  Now im stuck here, on EP, trying to make sense of what is warping my world by typing it out for random people to read. Doing so must do something aside from just getting it out, considering this is not my first and probably not my last post on EP. Assuming that the microscopic speck of ease that writing on EP gives me is due to the support and understanding of fellow people who suffer with what i suffer, thank you and goodnight..
-2	negative	personality-disorder	Recently there have been some books published about introversion, and I've realized that I'm not shy - I just prefer to connect with people on a deeper level, and don't feel the need to have shallow relationships with a lot of different people.
-2	negative	personality-disorder	Restarting everyday is what it feels like and never reaching the end.
-17	negative	personality-disorder	Right after I got out of college, I started to expand on the interest I had in acting. I had performed in two consecutive shows with an actor who always had a great wit and smile with him. I had seen him perform in other shows (and direct one) and I had always hoped to perform with him. Unfortunately, they were the only two shows I performed with him. Seven months after the last show he and I were in, he took his own life. I had heard one source that he had fallen on hard times. To this day, I always look back at his positive attitude and wonder why he would want to take his own life.
-4	negative	personality-disorder	RIP to my friend Yoko. May she be in all of our prayers tonight. It was Yoko's time, and anyone's can come at anytime. 
-6	negative	personality-disorder	Schizoaffective disorder, is better than being Schizophrenic, but worse than being just bipolar, it is in between, a combination of both. I used to be a pure schizophrenic, but by the grace of God when my darkness turned to light, my diagnosis changed from Schizophrenia to Schizoaffective, I really did notice a great change in my life, with much more abundant peace, I was surrounded with more beauty than darkness.

-9	negative	personality-disorder	Seriously I know I have OCD, I always have to have my house clean, if its not done in the morning I swear it throws my day off (bc of course I have a schedule) and if something's out of place. It drives me FRICKEN nuts!!! The only exception is my boys rms, of course their doors are closed so I don't have to have mini convulsions looking into their rms.
-13	negative	personality-disorder	Several weeks ago, my uncle passed away. Since I was part of a community theater production, the first thing I did was e-mail the director and producer to tell them of my loss. At the time, I didn't know when the viewing or funeral was, so I wouldn't know if it would interfere with rehearsal schedule. I also wanted them to know that if I seemed upset or distracted during rehearsal the following night, this would be why. They both offered me their cyber-condolences. (By the way, the producer was also responsible for getting all the cast bios. Even though it was past the due date of submitting the cast bios, she allowed me to make one amendment to my bio. In my last sentence, I said that I was dedicating my performance to my uncle "who passed away earlier this month.") 
-12	negative	personality-disorder	Should I go to a small get-together that will involve drinking even though I don't drink with a guy friend who I used to like and was romantically rejected from in the past?  His new girlfriend and 2 other friends that i do not know will be there.  I am worried I'll get too anxious -- most likely feeling bad that I used to like this guy even though it's in the past and I am mostly over it.  I just, I want to go to meet more people but it might be anxiety provoking.  I actually am glad he had a girlfriend, that helps me get over him and I didn't want to hang out with him one and one, so I think this is a good opportunity.  But still not easy.
-1	negative	personality-disorder	So anyone who knows me on here knows that I tend to have mood swings, well this is way worse not sure if it's worse, just kind of freaky. Thanks for reading.
-1	negative	personality-disorder	So basically, I don't really have dissociative identity disorder (at least I'm pretty sure that I don't) but I have 6 personalities, including myself. So if any of you ever message me and I sound weird (overly polite, overly rude, using a lot of curses, extremely emotional, seeming to have no emotions at all, repeatedly calling you "dear" or "darling" or refer to myself as "we,") it's probably one of my other personalities talking. If that happens, don't worry, I'll get back to you soon :P 
-8	negative	personality-disorder	So I have a lot of friends but most don't have the time to hangout due to school and neither do I. To be honest I like to be alone more often than not, I can think clearly when I'm alone and when I'm around people, I can think clearly but when I'm alone it's much deeper thinking which is usually about my day or daydreaming. Every once in a while I get really lonely not a lot and I do like being around my friends but like being by myself more. To me this is normal I'm not sad or anything just like being alone.
-13	negative	personality-disorder	So I have always been that kid who's well organized, clean and turns in their homework on time. However since I've been getting older, OCD seems to be taking up a lot of my life. Now, I not only keep a well organized room, but everything needs to be color coordinated, including my outfits for school. Even the paper I write on has to match the outfit for that day. I have to walk up and stairs with starting on my left foot first, or else I have to do it over again. With my school work, for instance math, I have to start with the last problem and work my way backwards. Also with the alphabet, I only do it backwards. But everyday I get the same people who stare at me awkwardly but I just smile and move on. Because as Bon Jovi says, "it's my life." 
-11	negative	personality-disorder	So I have had major changes in my life this year. I graduated from college and moved back home. I'm working at a job I hate and living with my crazy family to save money. I want go to graduate school. The thing I have realized after being home for a while is that I'm lonely.  Maybe no one will understand this, or maybe all of you will think I'm being a baby. I thought by writing down some of my worries it would help me and maybe someone out there would understand too.
-10	negative	personality-disorder	So, I'm 13, in year 9, I've only really started to have severe anxiety problems since Starting high school, I used to have them before bit they weren't as bad then. I had 3 years of non stop bullying, I used to be lied to, I hate going to school and have panic attacks when I arrive. I can't go out on my own, I have to go with someone and I don't eat breakfast or lunch, I only eat 1 meal a day cos I'm never hungry. All the bullying and stress lead me to self harm, which I did that for 3 years, I'm over that now cos the bullying seems to have stopped, but I was diagnosed with Anxiety disorders and possible bipolar, but I'm getting help now.  Michael.
-4	negative	personality-disorder	So I'm haveing problems at home and I have run away before but i went back. I want to leave again and actually stay gone though, but i have no where to stay. Would anyone be willing to let me stay with them??? I'm 15 and ill be 16 in april. and I live in wisconsin Rapids
-5	negative	personality-disorder	So, I never realized how much my life relies on the internet until I no longer had it. Literally, my life IS the internet. And now. Now I have lost it T_T I won't be able to get it back until mom gets paid. Le sigh OTL
-11	negative	personality-disorder	So I should back up and say that I've been clean now since September 2012. During that year and a half my kids moved in with my parents, I lost my house, my job and my respect. I lived from friends house to friends house. Well so called friends anyway. We were always looking for our next hit. It was all so much. I mean a year and a half felt more like 20. And so much happened in that short time. And then I have days like today where my day was so hard and work was so awful that I just want to go get high for awhile. I have to remind myself how bad the come down can be and that just one is too many and a thousand won't be enough
-2	negative	personality-disorder	So I took this personality test and discovered I am an INFP.  
-4	negative	personality-disorder	So, I used to self harm.  My immediate family knew but no one else. Lately, I have been getting the same feelings that I used to and turned back to self harm. I just want to be able to talk to someone who won't judge me.
-1	negative	personality-disorder	So many different sides. The way I am with my family, friends, strangers, figures of authority, people I hate, people I like, all of my personalities are different. I wish I knew which one is truly me
-1	negative	personality-disorder	So many sides I don't even know who I am? How are you supposed to find that out?
-3	negative	personality-disorder	Someone on my feed posted that quote where the guy says that a loser is someone who is so afraid of not winning that they don't even try. I just wanted to say that, for people like me, that's not true. I'm not a loser, I'm a perfectionist, and I need encouragement too. Shame just makes it worse because shame (and fear of it) is what was motivating my avoidance to begin with. 
-2	negative	personality-disorder	Some times for no reason at all, I feel like I cannot breathe, and my eyes well up and I cry.  I feel panicked.  I feel this sense of impending doom on my life, on my heart   some times I wake up in the middle of the night because I've had a bad dream, or I am sweating for no apparent reason  I feel like I cannot control my nerves some times, I want to scream and pull my hair because my body is aching, every last molecule feels discomfort afraid.. like I am falling into this black hole and no one can hear my screaming.    I feel shaky some times, my hands tremble or I feel dizzy from hyperventilating.     I know some day it will stop. I have faith in that.
-4	negative	personality-disorder	Sometimes i beleive from myself that i passed trought the madness and i survived,now i believe that crazy is crazy and there are not pills for this madness.
-2	negative	personality-disorder	Sometimes I don't like the way I am. Sometimes I wish I had a different life. But, oh well :/
-11	negative	personality-disorder	Sometimes I feel as though it isn't a legit reason that I self harm occasionally because I'm EXTREMELY insecure about myself. Than I realize I'm not alone. The only thing I'm really scared if is I might be blowing this out if proportion( that's what my friends and family would say). But u don't think that I am.  The other tunes I've don't it they were like scratches so no one would see the. And find out but for the first time I think they might end up as scars and not go away. I feel like I'm getting worse the more I think about things and I also get more insecure which cause me to bully and beat myself up even more.
-1	negative	personality-disorder	Sometimes I'm "me" & then others this seductress takes over. I'm flirtatious, careless, seductive
-11	negative	personality-disorder	Sometimes I pretend to be my favorite characters from certain books haha. I absolutely love reading and sometimes i just love the characters so much that I act them out. I'll be in my kitchen saying their lines and if someone walks in and asks what I'm doing I say  talking to myself XD ( everybody I know believes I talk to myself)
-2	negative	personality-disorder	So my best friend invited me to her son's 12th birthday party and I don't want to go.  I know we're best friends and I'm supposed to want to be there with you, but I'd rather skip the party. I'm dreading it. 
-5	negative	personality-disorder	So this is hard to say. 4 years ago my parents started fighting and now they blame it on me. I try to let it go but it's so hard. Now I'm getting bullied in school. And I cut myself to deal with my feelings. I just want someone to talk
-6	negative	personality-disorder	So yeah I think Im borderline psycho. I have different personalities. They have names. They like different kinds of food and stuff. I dont know if I really do have multiple perosnalities or its just my excuse for my lack of ability in decision making lol.
-10	negative	personality-disorder	STOP WHILE YOU CAN!! I cut myself.. but I'm not the emo type and I don't tell anyone about it but when I do I think its seriously annoying that they think I'm doing as a trend. I don't do it all the time..only when I'm angry. I'm glad to say I don't do it much anymore. I'm trying my best to control myself. The deepest cut I made on purpose was when my gf broke up with around august last year. I was so shocked I couldn't cry and the feeling wouldn't go away so I did what I thought I should do I made a cut on my wrist so deep I could see my vein and took the blade out as soon as I noticed it. What was weird is I didn't feel any physical pain and I'm thankful I saw it in time otherwise I wouldn't have stopped. Now I have a scar half way through my wrist and I regret it. I'm reminded of my mistakes every time I look down my hands. So I'm pleading to those people that are just starting to cutborvhave thought of it, stop now because its a lot harder to quit than you think. 
-1	negative	personality-disorder	That socially awkward shy geek that hangs out alone at a party by the food table in a grey t-shirt and jeans listening to their own music through headphones and fiddling with an iPhone. Though I'm seen more often in book stores or gaming stores, if I'm seen outside at all, and rarely parties.
-1	negative	personality-disorder	"That strange sensation of noticing everything and everyone around you and knowing they haven't yet noticed it themselves. It's somehow sad when you see more than others. Its like a glass. You see everything and touch nothing in those moments"  This is a very real problem for us INFP's and its largely the reason why we often feel so different, alone or odd. 
-11	negative	personality-disorder	"The best people possess a feeling for beauty, the courage to take risks, the discipline to tell the truth, the capacity for sacrifice. Ironically, their virtues make them vulnerable; they are often wounded, sometimes destroyed." This quote speaks to me about the sensitivity I carry as an INFJ in my relationships and in experiencing the realities that unfold during the day. I believe there is a reason for the way I am, thatit serves a greater purpose and the emotional risks are worth it. It has value, I have value.
-1	negative	personality-disorder	The bruises on her skin,tell the storyof how mentaught herrightfrom wrong
-4	negative	personality-disorder	The first time I heard of this was reading peoples posts on here. And reading them makes me feel that there's a good chance I have the same thing!!
-4	negative	personality-disorder	The future looks bright for both Big Tobacco and people who enjoy the totally awesome pleasure of their cigarettes.  It was always thought that when these kids came of age, the first generation to have internet from the time they were born, they would be more independent, more fun-loving and more into experierncing the pleasures of life, having seen so much of the bs of society before they were 18. And, sure enough. Between 2011-2012 Sales of E-Cigarettes to 10th, 11th and 12th graders increased 100%, a record increase not just for young people but for E-Cigarettes overall.
-15	negative	personality-disorder	The other day I was biking the city and biked/stumbled upon a golf course Dad and I often played.  It was a cheap, city course that many university students played but it was beautiful, with many desert rock formations, great views of the city and the airplanes coming and going, and it was next to the zoo and I remember some days you could hear a lion roar and always, the noisy sounds of  tropical birds. There we were, at the entrance to this beautiful place.  I could still see the clear images of Dad, hear the clear sounds of his voice.  Unloading his golf clubs, taking his golf shoes off and putting his street shoes on.  Smiling and asking me if I wanted a sandwich or get some coffee.  Suddenly I realized where I was and his loss felt so enormous again.  I cried a lot and just let it all happen.  The feelings passed and I looked up to the images of Dad again and remembered, so I continued on my bike ride.
-1	negative	personality-disorder	The past few nights I have been crying myself to sleep with these crazy panic attacks which are brought on by a number of stupid actions, thoughts and silly things. Mostly, the fact that I absolutely hate sleeping alone after my signif. other has left me (a bit silly.) and also how much I miss my dad.  I'm exhausted and sick of not being able to sleep a whole night through at this point.
-7	negative	personality-disorder	There are moments when I crave to be with people, have a partner, etc. and lead a normal sociological life. Yet many of those times those thoughts get brushed aside when I remind myself of how liberating and comforting it is to be alone, doing "me" things. I wish I could find a reasonable balance between being an introvert and a social butterfly.
-6	negative	personality-disorder	There are no words to describe the pain, I could not walk with ount a cane, The grief took all of my walking hours, Some day i could not even shower. It got hard and hard just to think, I was teetering on the brink. No longer the person I'd once been, I would have begin again. The grief took all i had days turned empty stress and sad. One day I decided it would not win, I stood up and set my chin, It would not be an easy fight, but I told my self it would be alright. From darkness I have come, to share my light with every one. Please join me in the search for a grieving cure. illness so many endure. Working together we can not fail, We can accomplish things on the grandest scale
-3	negative	personality-disorder	There is always someone telling me I need to speak up or talk more. I just dont feel like it sometimes. If that's the way I am, people just need to accept it instead of making me change who I am.  That is something I can't stand. 
-17	negative	personality-disorder	There's a total of 21 in my family. Sean's the oldest. He's 24. His girlfriend lives with us too. I could her as part of our family too because I know he loves her and will marry her. She's 24 too. Then Sean's 2 younger brothers live here. Tori, the oldest of the two brothers is 17 and then Jesse is 15. Then is Lucy. She's adopted and is 16. I'm 15 and I was adopted into the family first. Then are Daniel and David. They're twins and are 13. Also adopted. Then is Madison. She's Sean and Sarah's kid. She's 10. Bailey would be next. She's adopted and is 7. Anna who is also adopted is 6. Then is Baby Leah. She's only around 18 months and is adopted. The triplets are next. Elijah, Landon and Mason. They're Sean's but the mother left. Last (and hopefully completely last) are the sextuplets. They aren't born yet. They're Sean and Sarah's. I'm pretty sure my family classifies as big.
-2	negative	personality-disorder	They're in my head and they won't go away. They fight and laugh but I'm not happy. They love my boyfriend and he loves them. Why can't I be like them? They're loved a lot. Not just by him. It isn't fair.
-3	negative	personality-disorder	They say blood is thicker than water. In science yes its true, but for me, at times water is much thicker in the emotional sense. By blood we may be related, but she is no longer family in my heart. No longer a friend. She is a demon, heartless, cruel, an enemy 
-1	negative	personality-disorder	This INFP thing describes me perfectly. It's pretty awesome
-9	negative	personality-disorder	This is a copy of an article written by Diane Cameron in the Christian Science Monitor on Jan 2nd 2008. She said everything that I want to say about being an Introvert quite perfectly. I have photocopied this and have it displayed in my kitchen so people can see it. Here it is : Well said Diane ! Although this article is aimed at American introverts it still totally applies to me anyway. Society in most countries is like this for introverts.
-2	negative	personality-disorder	This is a long story, but i have had this on my chest for 1 year, and i need to get it out, so weather or not your prepared to read it is up to you.
-4	negative	personality-disorder	This is my first post and as most of you INFPs will be able to relate, it is easier for me to open up to strangers, rather than divulge my inner most feelings, thoughts, or dreams with those that I love and/or love me.   I love and care about those around me, I do!  But I will always be the first to walk away from any relationship.  I keep all people at arm's length.  I will not allow anyone to get close enough to know me, and know my heart.  If I did, they would ridicule my dreams and leave me.   While my heart is a shield and I won't let it down, while I am so afraid to fail so I won't even trywell how can I say I'm alive
-4	negative	personality-disorder	This is my first post here, and I know this isn't a dating site, so I'm sorry if this is the wrong place to talk about it. 
-1	negative	personality-disorder	This is not so much a story as it is a bit of a question/advice seeking. Recently a friend of mine proposed going to Europe together for five weeks. My first reaction was a bit of panic at having to be with someone for five whole weeks. As all you other introverts do as well, I enjoy quiet time and just doing my own thing, and my friend is the exact opposite. Has anyone travelled with someone and what has the experience been like? I've done a few trips with groups of people, and while they've been really fun they've also been a bit stressful and draining for me. Also I don't know if the alternative, travelling alone, would be too lonely.
-7	negative	personality-disorder	This is the first time these words have ever slipped past my lies, and this is the most truthful thing about me:  Please, if you have any tips that have worked for you in breaking the cycle, share them. I'm going to start by telling small truths in instances where I wouldn't normally. I hope that I can use those moments as building blocks to propel me into honesty in all areas.
-2	negative	personality-disorder	This may sound strange but I need someones help. I need someone to pretend to be a girl named Anna for my exboyfriend. its a pretty complicated situation. PM me for details. it wont be a long thing. preferably someone who lives near the bay area in california or in sonoma
-3	negative	personality-disorder	This means nothing.yers can range in height from 6'1 to 7'2, but greatness lies in passion.
-3	negative	personality-disorder	This times two. Yes, I have two children under the age of ten with ADHD. I love them dearly and would change a thing about them. However, some days can be mentally exhausting with them. Still, they are my life and joy.
-2	negative	personality-disorder	this was a wonderful night.   i sure wish that when we toke that picture together, you showed up beside me.
-1	negative	personality-disorder	This wasn't written by me, I just thought it was brilliant: 23. You alternate between phases of work and solitude, and periods of social activity.
-4	negative	personality-disorder	Those who have hormonal imbalance, have you found anything that is working for you?
-5	negative	personality-disorder	Throughout my life, I feel as though I have created many versions of myself.  My dad died of cancer when I was 11 and ever since (the past nine years) I have not been the same.  I feel as though my many personalities try to help me through life.  I will tell you about them, just because I've never took the time to really write down what their personalities are like. I hope it's not weird for me to talk about myself in the first and third person.  But at the same I don't really care because Colt and Sam are writing this, so I don't really care what other people think of me right now.
-17	negative	personality-disorder	Today i look for someone just for me.                 Someone who will love me even if i can"t fulfill their wish.                                                 Someone who has love me alone.                   But,..there is another me .                                   The other me ask "does such a person exist? I want,.. Someone who loves me without asking anything in exchange                                      Unless the someone loves me for being me they"re not just someone for me                       The other me asked is that so? It is . This someone exist?he does but what if that person doesn"t loves you back? Asked the other me i answer then i"ll have to decide,..  decide and then do what must be done.            Me and the other me
-11	negative	personality-disorder	Today in gym class I had a anxiety/panic attack out of no where! I was fine one minute than I was on the ground the next. I blacked out for most of it though. All I remember is not breathing. Than me gym teacher in my face holding me down than blacked out again the people surrounding me.. Than blacked out Than me on the ground crying a coughing Than feeling all this terror.. Than I was fine. People said it lasted a long time but it felt like 6 seconds. Scary stuff man.
-2	negative	personality-disorder	Today once I came back from the store with yet another unneeded purchase and seeing the look in my husbands eyes was a wake up call that I need to admit I have a compulsive habit.  I realize I need to stop this now as it can totally destroy my family but don't know how to curb it. Where do I begin and why is it so hard for me to just be able to not buy everything I see that I like.
-7	negative	personality-disorder	to everyone and everyone , I know it doesn't hurt to ask  i do not have any family or anyone else i could turn to. things have been all downhill mainly, i don't know what else to do after fighting for so long ,all my life, i just kind of feel like i do not want to fight anymore. today, i am financially buried with all sorts of bills, car got repossessed, storage about to go up for auction, my rent is way overdue and my landlord is just cruel and insensitive towards me and my situation.my unemployment was stopped a couple months back,i don't really have family at all.they are just labels, mom dad, but have never really been there to support me  in anything i have nor ever do. I am also a warrior, that i am convincedi know that with God anything could happen so that is why i am asking for help   i know that i have such a strong calling that is why my hardships are endless.
-1	negative	personality-disorder	To my husband,My mind bogged down, with wasted words.
-6	negative	personality-disorder	Totally. When some people state that INFJ's can read peoples souls, I feel slightly exposed, because, although I feel completely cautious about admitting this, I often find myself reading people. I like to understand the ones around me because of my general love of life and all. I always see something else to feel happy about. However, my urge to remain hidden holds me back from sharing this.                           I just want to spread a little joy around. Haha.
-1	negative	personality-disorder	Two roads diverged in a wood, and I-- And I am lost.
-3	negative	personality-disorder	Ugh I hate it I feel like every thing has to be on the right side like if something touches my left leg I touch my right leg twice I hate odd numbers too in school it's hard for me because when something happens it can be hard for me to make it the right way my OCD is controlling me I hate it so much 
-1	negative	personality-disorder	Ummmm well I feel sooooo misunderstood by everyone, just like I don't really understand this website thing. But I have one infj friend that understands me heaps and it'd be great to have some more.
-16	negative	personality-disorder	Unfortunately I'm not sure if this is possible since I was born with OCD & have had severe anxiety since I was a toddler. I believe the anxiety was triggered by my step brother molesting for the first 5 years of my life. Moving forward because my past is very dark & I don't feel like getting into the details of it just yetI have a 2 year old son who is also showing symptoms of OCD/anxiety & it breaks my heart because I understand what he is going thru. I haven't found the right therapist yet & am considering using self help handbooks to combat my OCD thoughts. Although I am currently working with a therapist he has done very little to help me get better. I have been feeling stuck & usually avoid leaving my house on most days. I am obsessed with avoiding people even if I know them. Due to this problem I often think I'll never have close friendships. Can anyone else relate to this problem?
-2	negative	personality-disorder	Washington Post says that $270bn housing aide since GFC still has not solved homelessness. Thanks
-4	negative	personality-disorder	Well first of ths is a new diagnosis for me. I have 1alter that I know of so far she my protector.  I learn alittle bit at a time about this diagnosis. So information would be great
-6	negative	personality-disorder	Well i did say, things were not going to be easy, at first you want to die, then you live. liven is still hard, for me any way, i'm going to give it every thing i got, guys i wish this on no one, i hope this never happen to you.   NOT YEY        page99
-7	negative	personality-disorder	Well I have 2 older brothers and they are awesome but I hardly talk to them anymore, not to worry though. I have always been the black sheep of the family so it's normal, if anyone has worries about if they are the black sheep of the family, I am always here if anyone needs to talk :D 
-4	negative	personality-disorder	Well, I live in a big city and study in a private school. My mates and friends and everyone I see cares about so trivial things like: money, clothes, grades, social networks, parties, complain about parents I hate them all!!!! I've always been quiet and have good grades, so my mates think i'm a feelingless nerd/geek, cause I am always like that near them;
-1	negative	personality-disorder	Well, it's been about 2 weeks sense the last time I cut.
-14	negative	personality-disorder	Well lately I developed a crush on one of my friends. I look up to him, he's just the perfect role model. I admire him so much that I came to the conclusion that I just have a crush on him. It hard for me because the only place I see him is at church so its hard to open up and express what I feel. Some people just take things too serious so I don't want to start a controversy. I feel like I'm going insane 'cause I tend to think about it ALL the time. I'm slowly gaining control of myself and now I look to be someone that parallels his values and well, just him in general (but NOT exactly the same as him, though). Thanks for reading! 
-6	negative	personality-disorder	Well, let me share my  story. I moved to a new state for a new big project. I work as a Project Manager. 6 months into it I got a DUI, no one was hurt but because it came out in the newspaper I  fired from my job yesterday because of it. This can ruin me financially with the lawyer costscourt fees, not being able to drive, getting a new job with a DUI. Now I am packing up all my belongings and need to drive across 5 states to get bck home. I am FUCKED!
-1	negative	personality-disorder	well partly I am, but only to one person. 
-4	negative	personality-disorder	well this is my first time to doing this but hi i'm 14 years old and currently going through ocd , its starting to ruin my life because everyday i cry and i'm in fear for my life , the thoughts i have are terrible like my mind likes to make me think i hate my mom and i know i don't stuff like this makes me cry everyday sometimes i'm scared to look at my mom or even tell my mom whats wrong because i don't want her to think i really hate her or that i'm crazy (i'm crying as i write this) but i'm pretty sure i'm probably the only person that has these thoughts i even take quizzes to prove i love my mom because i let my mind get the best of me i really need help and it hurts me everyday.. Can someone please tell me i'm not the only one that has thoughts/or problems like this? because i have a fear of hating my mom.. am i crazy or do i really hate my mom , i really hope i don't because i know really love her.. i just know it, but my minds making me think otherwise..
-12	negative	personality-disorder	Wellwhere do I begin. I've always been a clown, I like to be silly. Funny voicesjokesyou get the idea I am sure. And for alot of that I was called "stupid, immature" anything you could tag with that. My mother left when I was 9, looking me in the eye and telling me she wouldn't go. And left me to wake up to ask my father "Where's mom?" To which he replied.."she left" she looked me in the eye and told me she wouldn't, did the opposite, it damaged my ability to trust people. And then I'd put on weight and it plagued me for years all through high school. And n between this, lotta messed up relationships, I am no saint, but had alot of people who claimed that they loved me, do things to me that you don't do to those you love. Sothere it is. If ya want to talk to me about these things. I will. And also just want a new friend. I get lonely alot so..lol 
-9	negative	personality-disorder	well yea i think most people are at my age 23. i especially get afraid due to the fact im a college student and i really cant have kids till i have my life in order. college then career then possibly kids if i can even carry. my boyfriend and i havent been using condoms and ive been on the pill. it still makes me worried so i always have pregnancy tests on hand just in case. 
-7	negative	personality-disorder	WE SKYPED! I always read how happy a text or how Skype makes the day better. and wow I am so happy and just seeing him I know we will be okay. I mean we weren't bad or anything but I was worried. I am so extremely happy. I know tomorrow will be a better day than today now. One day at a time right? they will add up eventually!
-3	negative	personality-disorder	What annoys me the most is when someone squeezes the toothpaste tube like it been in a fight or leaves it open/uncovered. 
-2	negative	personality-disorder	What happens to these people if the person being lied to decide to press chargers??? That's what I'd be worried about just sayin
-14	negative	personality-disorder	What happens when being different around others becomes a daily routine? I feel as if I have to be different when I'm around a different group of people. When I am at school I act confident, together and cool.. When really I am just happy to be accepted by a group of people instead of hated. When I am home and at work.. I have to be more to myself, because honestly .. no one cares enough to think about the type of person I truly am. I make sure to get into anyone's way. If I meet you for the first time, the way you bring yourself determines how my personality will be. My personality differs. My true personality is something nobody will really see.. Unless they want to actually know me, that is.
-13	negative	personality-disorder	What seems crazy to you might seem normal to me and vs. vrs.. It is all in how each individual perceives things. Now when you start to annoy yourself, there is an indication that you might want to back track your thinking process a bit. And ask yourself, why. Where did that thought start. And how do I change that connection. We are constantly thinking. The train never stops. So it might be a little hard to get to the actual root but.you can recognise and swap. You have to swap or switch it with something that makes sence or it will just keep cycling as normal. You can fix negative! But I guess it is all in if you want to or not. Negative might be your comfort zone. Its what you are used to. What you are familiar with. But you also have to remember, you arent the only one in this crazy world. Its not all about you. But im one of the 'nutso cooky' ones too. So dont listen to me. LOL!
-2	negative	personality-disorder	When Im upset i clean. I don't know why but every time someone gets yelled at or someones crying. I just start cleaning and ignore the world. When i clean i have got to get everything perfect. I have a special place for everything. And if my bros mess a little bit i would fix it when they're not looking. Sometime i do it around my friend and i don't even notice.
-1	negative	personality-disorder	When I think about certain things and people I panic and get so scared. I feel like I'm being suffocated and dragged underwater every second I have one. I have them everywhere at Anytime in school at home or any public place. My heart beat increased and I feel it all going.
-8	negative	personality-disorder	When I was a child in primary school, the memories I have are of not being able to verbally express myself very well, of having very few friends and spending a great deal of my lunchtimes sitting on a rock under a tree, imagining fairies and watching the birds. This pattern continued through primary school, I formed friendships with one person at a time, but often found the pressure of relating to be quite great. Although I was able to adapt for a certain amount of time, these friendships ended, usually because of a great lack of verbal and social skills. I was considered an 'oddball', and although not overtly bullied, my intuition told me that I was misunderstood. As a result, I internalised this and came to the conclusion that I must be missing some vital element for relating.
-5	negative	personality-disorder	When I was in school everyone wasn't respectful and they kept on saying I'm stupid because every time I talk to them I would like fake a childish accent so that they would enjoy every word I say, that time my accent is really childish but my attitude was not as childish as them, I just tried to talk like that so that they won't think I'm very rude to them but it turned out to be wrong then my friend told me, "Don't try to change yourself just for people to notice you, just be yourself and have fun." In that time I was very surprised that someone said that because I was not expecting that to happen. So after everything that my friend told me I was at least a little confident to show who I really am and starting to have many friends.
-3	negative	personality-disorder	When my cuts get lonely they need friends So I make them new friends  And the cycle never ends
-5	negative	personality-disorder	When my doctor told me I had anxiety bad and put me on medication I didn't know what to do. I took it a few times when needed but I don't want to take it. I want to control it on my own and slowly I am. My anxiety is holding me back from sleep and going on vacation. Sometimes I cry an because I feel like there is nothing I can do to stop it. Tonight I realized I wasn't alone though and that there is others like me.
-9	negative	personality-disorder	Where do I start? Basically, my life revolves around this disorder as well as social anxiety. While I ride the spectrum, most of the time symptoms make themselves apparent and feel intense. Although, I suspect that there is a genetic link to this, there is no one around me, who understands depression, anxiety, or how it impacts me. Along with GAD, I also have social anxiety, PMDD, and PTSD. I have experience with seeing a psychiatrist and medication, what else can I do, myself? I would like to know what other people's experiences are, and how I can cope with working & interacting with people, in general?
-10	negative	personality-disorder	Whether I am alone, with friends, or at school I always feel that someone somewhere is watching me and judging me at whatever I am doing. Whenever I try and do something I want to, I always think that people are laughing at me or thinking how stupid I am. In school I can barely show my face because I am so scared that people will laugh because I am so uncomfortable with myself.
-20	negative	personality-disorder	Who knew there were so many pregnant womenor that there were so many babies? Moving forward is hard, especially with so many painful reminders. Each time I see a picture of one of my smiling pregnant friends or hear a baby cry, it's like a knife is being shoved through my heart. But I've decided to fake it til I make it. So today I got up, washed my hair, slapped on some mascara and went shopping. Again, who knew there were so many baby shops!? Hubby and i also went for counseling and for the first time I realized how hard this has been on him. All this time he has been wiping my tears and reassuring me when he also needed a little love and attention. So I'm dusting myself off and smiling through my tears because I have to believe that things will get better. The hurt will never go away but it will become manageable. Or so they say
-3	negative	personality-disorder	"Why Are You Still There?" Anyway, one of the big reasons I have for not looking for work elsewhere is having to go through the torture of job interviews.  I should start now trying to figure out the answers to the types of questions I will face.  I might be ready for those interviews in a few years.  By then, I hope to avoid my grandkids asking me, "Why are you still there?"
-12	negative	personality-disorder	Will self harm ever get easier to stop? I cant seem to go one day without any more.i think it some point it stopped being about helping myself get through some things and became a necessity ..the need always seems to be stronger the more alone i am but its not like i can constantly surround myself with people like i used toopeople have their own lives 
-3	negative	personality-disorder	Will the thoughts ever go away? The flashbacks will they ever float away? Will the scars ever fade? Did I deserve this? 
-9	negative	personality-disorder	With me the introvert overrides everything so it dominated my personality.  that with the never ending thinking about why are we here and who am, always made me feel odd man out or just strange.     I often write things down that I think about and send it to my wife who acknowledges but doesn't really get it and that's fine.   Self reflections are just part of who I am but its also a good thing helps me relate to other people and surprising to myself when people are down I find I can feel what they feel and unlike most other people want to try and help that person, help them emotionally if I can, seems to be where I shine the most
-13	negative	personality-disorder	Without going into great detail about medications, therapy, breakdowns, mania, black depression, periods of psychosis and so forth, I feel like I've got this. It's not to say everything is perfect, but I do - I've got this. Well, not always, but enough to see how, despite the grievances, there are some gifts hidden within bipolar disorder. I am insanely (haha) creative and well versed in the arts, I am poetic, I am empathetic, I am so many things that have value. There are a lot of amazing people who have bipolar disorder and brought things into the world never considered before. How many artists experience mood disorders? It has influence on their development and what they create - I know it does. There are terrible, awful days. And there are days of absolute brilliance.
-8	negative	personality-disorder	Yesterday, my uncle (my dad's youngest brother) passed away. Not only I am grieving over his death right now.. His sudden death has triggered off the painful memory of my traumatic loss when I was young. It feels like my parents have died all over again. I thought I am done grieving for their death years ago, but why does it keep on coming back every time i hear a close family member died? Perhaps it's true what this quote says, "Losing someone when you're young is the greatest pain anyone can face". How much time do I need to heal completely? Is there any better way to grieve for my painful childhood loss?

-18	negative	pet-peeves	2 years ago I met a boy called Caleb. After 3 hours he became my best friend as I was VERY lovely at the time. I fell in love with him, really quickly. Recently I got over him and told my best friend Chantelle. 6 days ago she said "Do you still love him?" I replied with, "Yes. I may not be in love with him but I still love him". I told Chantelle I didn't love Caleb only very shortly after I realised myself. For the past 4 months I had been spending a LOT of time with a boy named George. I had slowly, but surely, fell in love all over again. I have been trying to get him to ask out the girl he likes. I know it's not me and I've just realised that no matter how many girlfriends he gets, this is no longer a pathetic little crush. I'm in love with George.

-1	negative	pet-peeves	All of these 'magnificent bastards/bitches'. Atheists who rail on religion/believers who rail on the heathens. Misogynistic women. Brand fetishizers and materialistic fools in general. Free market capitalists. Marketers. Stock brokers. Democrats and republicans. America as personified. Fundamentalists. Hipsters. People who don't know how to argue but insist on arguing. And they all think they're right.
-16	negative	pet-peeves	Almost four years ago I lostsomeone I loved more than life,the day before she died we quarreledand I thought nothing of it, sure that things would blow over and we would be back to normal the next day. therewere no morenext days and for the last four years I have been haunted by the thought that my words somehow contributed to her death, I must say at this point that shedied froman undiagnosed medical condition but at the back of my mind I cant help thinking that Icontributed to her death and on top of that she left without knowing how much I love her. I lock these thoughts away deep in my mind its the only way I can cope, but every year approaching the anniversary I always suffer nightmares and sleepless nights, I'm not the sort of person who doescounselling so I thought writing things here might help. to anyone who might read this please don't takethings for granted and make sure the people you love know it.sorry for being so maudlin its all I ever seem to do here.
-2	negative	pet-peeves	A lot of things.. though I know i have nobody to blame but myself. 
-5	negative	pet-peeves	Alright girls I have a problem. My soldier is in AIT at FT Benning right now and he only has 2 1/2 weeks left. I was admitted to the hospital last night and I have yet to leave. I know that if I tell my soldier he will worry, big time. I don't want to worry him or distract him but honestly he is the only person I want to talk to right now. My mom is planning on coming up this weekend but I don't want her here. I just want him. I just want to talk to him about it and I'm afraid that that's the worst thing I could do for him. He tells me that he thinks of me 24/7 already. I don't want him getting hurt or something because I'm a distraction. What do I do?Do I tell him and just pray it won't affect him too badly? Or do I keep it to myself?

-5	negative	pet-peeves	and I followed the truck on my bike trying to stay in the cloud.  lots of kids did it.  glad i did not diebut now as i age i regret that i did this because somehow it may come back to haunt me like give me some syndrome or something.
-6	negative	pet-peeves	And it always made me feel sick to lie. I knew I would be caught in the end and if I wasn't then how could I be okay with myself for doing wrong and getting away with it so I know how some liars feel. I have lied and been lied to. I hate the feeling when I realize someone is not being honest with me its a mix of anger and sadness. I just think we all should work on being honest
-10	negative	pet-peeves	And then there was one. I get up and I wish the sun would never rise again. When I wish I had shot myself when I had the chance but I can't even do that right. Everytime I see a couple kissing, it makes me sick. And when I lose everything because I was too stupid and believed that someone actually cared. I have nothing left. There is no love in my life, so I replaced it with hate. Constant hate, it's all I got left. Nothing else could love me. And if I lose that, then I've come full circle, it'd be time for me to die. I couldn't live in a world like that after what I endured.
-3	negative	pet-peeves	And while my first response was from someone really nice and told me not to give up, the second was from a troll who thinks it's funny to flame people who just want advice. Then she got a buddy to join her and kept replying to her comment and ugh I'll probably do another  post on this because I need to.

-7	negative	pet-peeves	As a pedestrian I find it very helpful to know if drivers are turning or not. It can even be to the driver's advantage as I will often yield to turning cars if there are only a few of them. But If they don't signal I can only assume they are going to go straight. Also drivers really need to look both ways before crossing through an intersection. Also the stop line is where you stop, not the crosswalk. I could go on for days
-4	negative	pet-peeves	As a victim of bullying myself, I know beyond a doubt that bullying is absolutely awful. I've grown strong enough now that if I see anyone doing it, I will personally go help the victim out. NO TOLERANCE!
-10	negative	pet-peeves	As you can probably guess from my other stories though I'm sometimes a hypocrite I dislike when people make fun or disrespect a big group of people. I know a lot of people personally that make fun of certain people above everyone else except maybe Muslims and that's people who are disabled. I thought this group was good to join for that because of knowing them and all the times I've been in the hospital with one of them and he or she was snickering next to me at a disabled person sitting on the other side of the room obviously uncomfortable about sitting near us because of it. 
-3	negative	pet-peeves	Atheism is the result of a general lack of imagination. You can't be 100% shure there are no divine powers. Weak people who NEED to know the answer to EVERYTHING because they are afraid of the unknown, the mystical. It takes the magic out of life.
-5	negative	pet-peeves	At least, that's why I assume my family does it.  I suspect this is because on some level, they still see me as a dumb kid. I know that I'm the least competent member of the household, but I'd like to be able to figure some things out by myself.
-5	negative	pet-peeves	Aww look at the cute ba..NO Whenever my baby cousin comes over who is fat and ugly we have to lock my dog outside just because he might violently lick her.Doesnt help he is a pit bull and trust me he is such a big softy.Also the door to the backyard is see through so he is sitting there crying while my baby cousin just sits there laughing
-10	negative	pet-peeves	Backstabbing, lying and trying to take advantage and manipulate is the worst thing a person can do to me. I have cut people off my life for good when they've wronged me. I used to hold grudges and wasn't too forgiving of people. But I'm working on this.I always tell people "tell me the truth even if it hurts me" I would rather know the truthas painful as it is then to not know or be lied. I respect a person that is honest an upright with me because that's the type of person I try to be.

That shes stupid for trying to do it while we were in the house? That shes so stupid for letting our brothers see her? shes so fvcking stupid!! im still soo mad at her cuz she didnt think that i wont be able to sleep months after that and that her little brothers will always see that picture of how much blood there was,that it would kill my parents if she succeded. she didnt think!  i love her and i cant describe how happy i am that shes still alive and i cant explain,but she killed me that day.

-7	negative	pet-peeves	Did you know there is a classification of individual called the Highly Sensitive Person or HSP?  I didn't until the past couple of years when I stumbled upon the online quiz and took it.  My score was over 90%oh yeah, there's no doubt!  Now, what was it? Having a peaceful and quiet home is important to me; with HSP and PTSD it's imperative!  You can look for my story on PTSD if you're interested.
-1	negative	pet-peeves	Disability is not brought on them, but it is a tragic situation that they find themselves in. It is hurtful to even witness the fun and bullying that the disabled have to endure. In addition to their suffering, we need to take it upon ourselves to explain tmore children at a much younger age so that they do not grow up to bullies.

-7	negative	pet-peeves	Everybody around me, all of the background conversations, they make me cringe. I'm not arrogant I simply think that today's youth is concerned with such petty little matters that it sickens me. Whenever I'm at school, I mentally face palm at least  seven times.  I stay under the radar and I've even been accused of being a snotty hermit. No, love. It's not that I don't like to socialize, it's that I'd rather eat my own thumb than hang out with idiots that talk about nothing other than the new ios7 and Miley Cyrus' VMA performance. 
-1	negative	pet-peeves	everyone has fears that taunt them. My worse fear is the fear of the 8 legged spider. ewwwwwwww!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Those things give me the hebbie gebbies. How am I suppose to face my fears of spider. I want to be able to over come my fear of them but for right now until I find away I will still be squilling like a little girl sqashing them with a broom flinging it half way across the world and duck for cover
-1	negative	pet-peeves	Ex was a liar and a cheater. Claimed he was faithful. Then he filed for divorce and filed a harassment injunction so that my legal representation and I could not ask for the reason of divorce.  5. Liars and Cheaters are usually very hard to tell what they are. Listen to your inner voice if someone gives you the vibe that they lie and cheat go away from them. 
-3	negative	pet-peeves	Feb 19, '12 was the last day I remember being truly happy..I don't remember what that feels like anymore. Some days I feel sad, maybe a twinge of anger when certain things come to mind..but most days I just feel nothing. Recently my nightly panic attacks & anxiety completely stoppedI've become unusually calm. I've never been calm like this before. Guess I truly have become numb.

-11	negative	pet-peeves	For me eating is a waste of time. Yes it's a necessity but the amount of time some people spend eating is astounding. Not only do I find it a waste of time I find it slows me down, the worst feeling in the world is the one after eating too much.  If I could live without food I would. I hate it, it's a waste of time and effort and I really needed to get that off my chest. I don't think it's unhealthy, after all not eating helps clears my head and helps me focus whereas food slows me down and leaves me feeling sluggish. 
-6	negative	pet-peeves	For Who will hear Me now, I am alone and alone I shall be. Where I sulk in nostalgia on these Treasured Memories Memories of where it was, of what could of been, of how it turned out. For the cry of Midnight is heard by me,  An owl in the trees, The wind in The leaves, The Silence and echoes, It Bellows. But Last and least, Myself. The one who is breathing quietly and deeply. The insignificance of My Life, It's so short. What meaning can I bring to It. Shall I ramble on forever.

-5	negative	pet-peeves	Got a score of 28, which explains quite a lot.  My teddy bear would score much higher.  He should take the Huggable Quotient test too, if there is such a thing.   Diagnosis of anything, in my experience, has been very inconsistent and unpredictable. 
-9	negative	pet-peeves	Growing up for some odd reason special kids liked me. Like when in church once a special needed kid need help with something so they asked me to come out and try to help. Of course I some how found out what was wrong with him. His family was moving and he didn't know how to express it. At my age now I know other kids who delicate there time to these kids. One of my former travel team's high school coach every day he sits next to them at lunch. Now that's a true friend right there. So don't make fun of special need kids. What if you were them how would you feel? They are just God's special children.

I have yet to know what is it like to have a friend, to have somebody to talk toabout anything. For some reason I still have a cell phone, the oldest thing you could imagine, and there the only contact that will answer is my mom. I am outgoing, will looove to go out, anywhere, and do anything, I have tried going by myself, to bars, movies, parks, restaurants and so on, and it was the worst possible idea ever, I jus felt really bad, only in public this time. Nice people online tell me that eventually I will find someone.sure
-7	negative	pet-peeves	Hello everyone  I am new to this site so I just wanted to put my story out there. My boyfriend of two and half years left for bootcamp two days ago, and naturally im absolutely heart broken because i miss him to pieces. I just recently turned 19 and he turns 19 in about two months. He graduates from Parris Island in April and I am already counting the days! I have already written him a letter and I am so anxious to send them  Did anyone else's boyfriend/fiancee/husband just leave for bootcamp?  Thank you all!
-12	negative	pet-peeves	Hello everyone! I'm new to this site and happy to write. I've never written anything anonymously, but it seems like a good outlet. My best friend told me about three weeks ago she has been wanting to kill herself for the past three years. I have done everything I can think of, researching, calling around, talking to her about it. I feel like, despite my best efforts, I'm not helping the way a friend should. I feel like any second I'm going to get a phone call that she's gone through with it and it scares me. I'm the only person she's told and she refuses to let me tell anyone, and I haven't. I know I should tell someone, but I couldn't forgive myself if it backfired. She tries to explain how it feels but, try as I might, I can't relate the way I wish I could. I've never been suicidal or depressed like her, and I feel like I'm thinking us both into a hole. Any suggestions? Thank you for anything, even if you only read this

If I din't know better I would say he was a police dog with all the training. He is greatly missed and could only be replaced by Whitney, a Lahsa Alpso with a heart of gold for one person.
-8	negative	pet-peeves	He was so controlling. I had to give up my friends cause he didn't like them or he didn't even trust girls cause they know guys. I couldn't go out wit my family. And if I did I had to call him and have him on the phone the whole time and if my phone dies I have to call him exactly at 9 when I get home. I couldn't wear anything I wanted.

-11	negative	pet-peeves	Hi everyone i just found out i have polyfragmented DID. I truly believe i have one if the worst cases. I most definetly have thousands of parts. And a hanful of personality clusters most i do not really think i know. It is very confusing living like this. I have a part of me for literally every task i have to accomplish a day. That includes walking writing everything just everything. I also never know who i am. I always feel disconected from people even ones i know and am constantly switching when i see a person or even an animal. So it is quite literally impossible to form relationships with anyone atm. I am 17 yrs old. Trama started 12-16. I also have little to  no feelings or emotions for my old life nor any of my friends. Basicaly my question is that is anyone else going throughthe same thing? DID is one thing but because i have so many parts i cant really get to know my other personality clusters. I feel very lonely with this at times. A response would be greatly appreciated

-6	negative	pet-peeves	how they come across online? Seems I can't go more than a few minutes without seeing another EP story, status update, or forum comment that is absolutely painful to read due to the following: -TEXT TYPE! This one irritates me perhaps the most. Do you really need to shorten words that are already short? Will it take that much more time to type one or two more letters so we can, you know, read what you typed without wanting to kill ourselves? Are we seriously that rushed nowadays (or that lazy) that we can't afford the extra fraction of a second it would take to type the whole word?
-9	negative	pet-peeves	How would you feel if you have just withdrawn funds over the ATM to buy something and just realized you lost the money, you dropped it? You were at the mall so obviously, you wont get your money cause someone has already picked it up?  Turn negative experience to a positive one! I thank God that i wasnt hurt when i lost the bills. And i appreciated the other things i still have. Promise muself i will be more careful next time.
-11	negative	pet-peeves	I absolutely cannot believe some people. I am a ridiculously non-judge mental person; it's how I was brought up to be and it has made me many friends over the years. But wow some people.has anyone seen the movie Shallow Hal? The one with jack black? Well I didn't believe until now that some people are actually like that; selfish and vain.      Now know this-I have absolutely no negative feelings towards her but much towards her behavior. First of all I am of Creole and Italian descent. I may look Mexican and there may be some in me but only very little. But why should that matter?  What reason does anyone have to judge anyone? I realize that it isn't in the nature of some people to be accepting of everyone like it is in mine but really. Just why?
-24	negative	pet-peeves	I am 15 years old. I have just recently lost my mom. it was 18 days after my 15th birthday so she has been gone for almost 6 months now and its killing me. I didnt lose her cancer or another illness but to suicide. I remember the day, it was a Monday (sadly) and i was gonna go to my boyfriend (now ex) house so i was coming home from the bus stop when i noticed that my dads car was in drive way and not my moms so i thought she went to the store and i thought my dad had an early day off so i was pretty happy. I lost it. I am still heart broken. I miss her so much. She was my best friend. I could talk to her about anything and everything. We went shopping together and got our nails and stuff done together. This has been such a large impact on my life. She was my world and mow she is gone from me. I sometimes think if she even loved me enough. How could she leave me like that? I will never know.

-9	negative	pet-peeves	I am annoyed by how my mother acts around my step dad. Before they met she could go out drink and have fun with friends or my brothers and I. But now it's like she is a totally different person and she doesn't have fun anymore, she is so much stricter and not very chill like she used to be. My step dad left for a week for a hunting trip and my mom has been so much fun and less strict and more laid back. I love it so much and she actually seems happy for once. 
-10	negative	pet-peeves	I am a person who believes in simple living and high thinking.I try my best not to be judgemental.But unfortunately I have always found myself surrounded by shallow people and it suffocates me.I feel like running away from everything to a place where I can spend the rest of my life around like minded people,where I can think differently and freely,where I can be myself, where its not difficult for people to appreciate and thank God for whatever He has given themI wish there was such a place  
-6	negative	pet-peeves	I am a really tall teenage girl and I've been made fun of ever since primary school. But I started my modelling class in January and I love it. I am naturally very shy and I just started modelling. I shouldn't be able to get a modelling job this early, but I am so tall that I've already done 5 shows and 2 photoshoots. I was also the best scorer in my school's girl's basketball team. So being tall has its good side.
-7	negative	pet-peeves	I am a science student in university, I want to be a doctor really bad but don`t know if I have the grades for it. My friends don`t think i am and its hard to talk to them about it.
-4	negative	pet-peeves	I am human. I make mistakes. And yes I have done things I'm not proud of. I've hurt people. I've kept secrets. I've lied. I am human. I make mistakes.
-2	negative	pet-peeves	i am lonely due to depression that is very common with epilepsy i worry a lot i take medication to ease both problems which does help.
-2	negative	pet-peeves	I am new to this site, but I couldn't be more happier to have found this page and these women! It's been 4 months since my soldier has been away, not including HBL. I realized before my boyfriend actually left how hopeless and alone I would feel with him away and no one around me to understand this experience fully, until now!! :D JocelynCierra

-2	negative	pet-peeves	I am one in a million. Trust me when I say you've never met a girl like me before.
-3	negative	pet-peeves	I am really quiet and shy, and when I go to parties I feel so awkward and bad about myself. I feel like I have no hope for meeting my potential love and new friends because I am so awkward. I have been going through a tough time and I thought going to a party tonight would help me feel better, but now I feel much worse. I feel sad about myself and who I am as a person and no matter how hard I try I cant change. I just feel like giving up. I should love going to parties and having fun considering I'm 19. What's wrong with me? I am really upset. 
-3	negative	pet-peeves	I am scared. I am terrified of the future. I am scared of tomorrow. I am scared because I know that they will notice that I shouldn't be here and that they will correct me. I am scared that sometime soon someone will notice and kill me before I can do it for them. I am scared and the only reason I am still alive is because I have rituals. Because I save myself with walks, with touching certain things, thinking certain things.
-9	negative	pet-peeves	I am turning 24 this summer. I am a female phd student at a great school.. I am traumatized by the fact that my emotionally abusive boyfriend left me. Deep down I know we are incompatible, and that I will be closer to who I want to be when without him, but it is so hard to be single again.. I fear that I would end up alone because honestly I will be spending the next few years in school, and by the time I graduate, I will be old, and ppl say you can't find pure real love when you are older..
-12	negative	pet-peeves	I became friends with someone online late last year, and we really hit it off.  Got to know each other very well and we had so much in common and so much to talk about.  After a few months, we got together in person, and it was just like online.  We could talk about anything and everything and time would just fly by. A bit over two weeks ago, she discovered that we had gotten together to have coffee recently because she was sneaking through his emails.  He's now cut off our friendship, and I feel this huge hole in my heart.  We wrote almost daily, and now there's nothing.  I'm angry at her for being so jealous that she couldn't even tolerate him having a friend, and I'm angry at him for giving in to her yet again.  It depresses me that I'll probably never hear from him again because of her jealousy, but I think it's even worse knowing that he doesn't realize what a healthy relationship looks like and so he'll probably continue to put up with this treatment for the rest of his life.
-2	negative	pet-peeves	I can't bear small talk, 'banter', having to fake laugh when speakers make jokes in presentations. It exhausts me.
-4	negative	pet-peeves	I can't believe it's been two months since you passed away. It seems like just yesterday you were making fun of my butterfly clip on my visor at work. I've tried to take it off since then, but I just can't. It means too much to get rid of it now. Love, No One
-1	negative	pet-peeves	I can't bring myself to hate a liar unless they are purposely trying to hurt someone I care about. If you think about it, liars have their reasons: self-consciousness, doubt, fear etc. I don't think it is fair to hate compulsive liars, either, because they have made a habit out of lying that is hard to break free from. Hate is a strong word. It is cruel to say you hate a liar, because they may simply have lied because they didn't want to be hated.
-1	negative	pet-peeves	I can't wen go outside now because my FRICKING DADS girlfriend says I can't and he just goes along with it!!! I can't go out past 8!!!!
-1	negative	pet-peeves	I could just be sitting there watching TV, or on my laptop, and 
-1	negative	pet-peeves	I didn't know there is a name for people like me. In fact, for a long time I thought there was just something wrong with me. Then about three years ago, after some intense google searching trying to diagnose myself with some kind of mental disorder I came across the expression Introvert. Ok so that explains why I can't make new friends or hold down a job for more than a week. Sometimes I can't even go to the grocery store without getting a minor panic attack. To me, introversion is a curse. I don't want to be this way, but I can't change. I've just had to learn how to adapt my life around it.
-2	negative	pet-peeves	I dislike my sister in law, she is very superficial and materialistic. She uses men and breaks their hearts :/  She is a wh! Gosh, I can't stand her voice, it's like a diabolical screeching cat's voice She has a twisted mind of hatred.  Sigh.  Enough. Bye.
-1	negative	pet-peeves	I'd like a friend to just talk to and get to know better 
-1	negative	pet-peeves	I'd love to kill, everybody in the world. 
-5	negative	pet-peeves	I do not text ppl very much not to bother them but When I do and they don't text back it kills me I have a friend which we usually talk in whatsapp, whenever she's alone sends msg and I reply back as soon I could but when I send msg she replies so late
-1	negative	pet-peeves	I don't drive, but I can feel the annoyance drivers have from people who don't signal. We see it too!. Please watch out for all fellow riders 
-3	negative	pet-peeves	I don't exactly understand why people make fun of things that nobody can change ( unless they have a lot of money ) like their nose , eyes,ears . Things that you were BORN with . You can't help but to have that / be that. You didn't choose it so why must you make fun of it?
-6	negative	pet-peeves	I don't hate old people I just get annoyed off sometimes by the ones who are really snobby and think they are the most important It annoys me sometimes when they slag off the entire younger generation. Yes kids were better behaved back then, Yes there a lot of younger people who think they have swag about causing mischief but not all of the younger generation are like that!!
-2	negative	pet-peeves	I don't know if I have gullible written on my head or something but I always get stuck with a friend who lies ALL THE TIME. I'm to nice I swear.
-5	negative	pet-peeves	I don't knowit been hard lately. I have no time to see my boyfriend or friends. I know it sounds stupidbut I feel alone. I can't go to school anymore because of my increasingly difficult hard to handle depression. Which sounds amazing to most, but it gets lonely after a while. And most weekdays I have therapy, which leaves me absolutely no time to see anyoneit's silly, I know.
-1	negative	pet-peeves	I don't know why.. But I want to cuddle and make out right now but I am alone in my cold bed..
-8	negative	pet-peeves	I don't know why it is but every time someone is talking one if my friends has to be rude and start talking over them and changes the subject. He's so rude he has a loud laugh and acts so over dramatic it's ridiculous. It's like all the attention is on him, and that's not even half of it! 
-2	negative	pet-peeves	I don't like that about myself. When im presenting in class im like "i can do this" but once im up there all of a sudden i forget what im going too say and uuugh its so frustrating!!! Then i start shaking and jeez i need to stop being so shy. Ive missed a lot of opportunities in my life fir being so shy 
-6	negative	pet-peeves	I don't like watching pro sports. So boring, i can think of a million other things i could be watching or a dozen other things i could be doing instead. I only put up with it during holidays because i know that it is unavoidable in that period. My dad is all sports all the time. Especially football and basketball. He also watches college basketball and football too.I don't mind olympic sports at least those athletes are pursuing a worthy dream in my opinion.
-1	negative	pet-peeves	I don't mind being lonely, but I hate when I open up Facebook and see people I know doing things. It makes me feel like it's not okay to enjoy being by myself, even though I know it's fine.
-2	negative	pet-peeves	I don't remember the last time I told anyone, "I love you." Not to my mother or father, to my sister, to my closest friends. I love my family and friends very much, but I can bring myself to say anything nice. Ever. I'm just neutral. I'm never very upset at anyone. I only make neutral comments and replies. I feel like this is what causes the sadness in my life, but I feel like I can't do anything about it. I feel so empty because of it.
-8	negative	pet-peeves	I drink smoke have done drugs and had some of the lowest and best times of my life using them. Every weekend i go out meet men and women and go home with some of them but then I will go to church the very next morning, sometimes even reading or teaching, and they do not know what I have been doing. Nobody knows the true me. Only the side I allow them to see.
-8	negative	pet-peeves	I feel like i have waited forever for this holiday, well i have really over 3 years its took us to save. This time last year i sat here saying omg just a year to go and now its only 5 days to go. I am surprised how patient i have been because i am not the most patient person really but i guess i had no choice but to wait lol. I think when i have to wait for something these days i kinda switch off and try not to think about it, half the time i don't believe it will happen till it does anyways. I don't get excited till i am there doing whatever i planned to do because i hate feeling let down if it does't happen.  I can't believe its only 5 days now, but my anxiety knows about it i tell ya!  x
-4	negative	pet-peeves	I feel like I met the right man just at the wrong time. Has anyone experienced this? I hope it works out down the road when the time is right. We both want our next relationship to be marriage Just scared to be hurt. We've each been through a lot.
-6	negative	pet-peeves	I feel more strongly on this than anything else in the world. People with disabilities should not be made fun of! I see kids around my school laughing at others with disabilities and I just get so worked up when I tell them to leave the kid alone. I used to have a panic/anxiety disorder before I started taking medication, so I knows what it feels like to not be able to   control your own mind and body. Let me tell you it is not fun, there were numerous times a week I would wake up screaming and wondering if life was worth it. So I STRONGLY believe that disabled people have enough to deal with without people laughing at them for things they can't control.
-10	negative	pet-peeves	if i ever watch too much tv or netflix(as of recently), i hear voices of the people i was just hearing. not saying any exact lines from whatever they were from, just them, talking. i find myself listening to them more than i think to myself. when i do catch myself listening i think, "i wonder if this makes me crazy" just tuning into something that isn't real. i'm diagnosed schizoaffective, which is like schizophrenia and bipolar disorder combines, but is that an excuse? i feel stuck.  i'm loving my life right now, but i HATE myself.
-5	negative	pet-peeves	I find humans does allot of stupid things.  Between drinking, smoking, harming the environment,  wars and many other things we don't need in the world.  But allot of humans don't care. They want their pleasure, they want their power and they don't care if it may cause harm to them self or others. This is what makes most humans stupid!
-10	negative	pet-peeves	I find it very mess up how there many schools out there how teachers make fun of disabled child.  This also happen to myself during my childhood.  Sometimes age does not matter as there people will never build decency no matter what age they are.   The adults that contribute to this can effect a child for the rest of their lives.  If I think about the life I had and many other people I know that haves disability, there not many people out there trying to make things better for people with disabilities. 
-5	negative	pet-peeves	I f n hate it when service is poor. Yeah, that's you EP. You are obviously experiencing difficulties. Is it too much to ask for a "sorry we're working on the problem" message from this EPAllie chick that was all up on my junk as soon as I joined? Oh, waitthat's a questionYOU PROBABLY CAN'T F N ANSWER IT!!!!!
-1	negative	pet-peeves	I found out that my crush is moving next week. I'll only be able to see her again once before she moves and I likely never see her again. 
-2	negative	pet-peeves	If someone wants to become frnd with me i would like it . I'm glad to have one I like to have friends but i can't make one
-8	negative	pet-peeves	I go for runs around my neighborhood about 3 times a week. There are these two kids, probably about 11 or 12 years old, who ride around on bikes, and every time they pass me they yell something rude or profane at me. The first few times, I ignored it. Today I snapped and yelled something back. I actually do feel somewhat threatened since I'm sort of small in size and there are two of them, but so far they haven't tried to physically harm me. I know I should probably just ignore them, but are there any suggestions of a different way to handle it?
-6	negative	pet-peeves	I go to a college with 22,000 people so I'm almost never actually alone. I get along easily with most people and am fairly outgoing; I have a fair share of friends. Yet I feel that there is no one that I truly connect with. We have shallow conversations and I force on a smile and interest to avoid actually being alone.
-3	negative	pet-peeves	I had a seizure and collapsed in the street on my way home from work, several months ago. I managed to get up after a few minutes and get to a clinic, but I was very disoriented and had a hard time filling out the medical info form that they required.
-14	negative	pet-peeves	I had terrible panic attacks that kept me from going to work and interacting with people. They were completely disabling.  My heart would be pounding out of my chest,  my hands would shake,  I could hardly speak,  my thoughts would race and my mind would constantly be looking for an exit. I thought I would be stuck with this curse forever.  I told my doctor about my situation and he prescribed me a medication called a beta blocker. It controls your blood pressure and keeps your heart from racing.  It took away all the physical symptoms of a panic attack.  I can now do my job with confidence and not worry about having a panic attack.  This has been such a great help to me and if you suffer from anxiety and panic attacks please ask your doctor if a beta blocker would benefit you. It honestly changed my life.  
-5	negative	pet-peeves	I had to have a lung transplant a few months back because of a rare lung disorder. Believe me, breathing air into healthy lungs and blowing it back out feels amazing!!! Walking up a flight of stairs without huffing and puffing makes me want to laugh. Seeing a group of people standing outside smoking  makes me want to throw things at them. I just don't understand why people want to ruin perfectly good lungs when they don't have to. Makes no sense to me. 
-2	negative	pet-peeves	I hate eating because I get tired as if I'm running, and then my jaw start to hurt too ..& its a waste of time too
-2	negative	pet-peeves	I hate it so much , i don't lie to others so why do they lie to me ? I cant even listen to them without thinking if they are Lying to me or not. I would love it if they just did not lie and told me the truth, I am a nice person and I do forgive. 
-3	negative	pet-peeves	I hate it when I'm having a bad day and I know he could cheer me up, but he's gone and can't talk to me. But his basic graduation is coming up!
-4	negative	pet-peeves	i hate liars this one boy always lie lie lie and i forgive forgive forgive and he abuse that part about me he lies does something and comes back saying sorry over and over again and i am so stupid to just say its fine . now hes crossed my line of forgiveness and i just feel so angry i feel like punching him until he lays on the ground gasping for air. this is the first time a boy has made me so mad that made me wanna punch him so hard -_-
-4	negative	pet-peeves	I hate texting. It has to be the stupidest form of communicating. My son texts his girlfriend while we are between jobs on the road. I driving of course. And he will ask me how to spell a word so he can text it to her. I always ask him why don't you just call her and either ask her how to spell it or just tell her the word? Not that she would know how to spell any word he didn't know how to spell.
-10	negative	pet-peeves	I hate that Facebook and iMessage tell when your message has been seen or delivered, because it makes my feelings for you seem so obsessive. You must know by now that it's hard for me even to trust someone anymore, let alone like them or love them. And you know I do. So why play with me like this? It feels like I'm just part of the bill that you've written off, said there must have been a mistake, that the mistake was me, and you will take no responsibility in it. I feel like a stone, cast down a river, skipping the one, two, and three times that you looped me in and then let me go, letting me sink to the bottom of the ocean that is our relationship. And can you even call it that when you skip the bill, and leave it written off when all is said and done?
-3	negative	pet-peeves	I hate the word "retarded" it drives me crazy when someone says that about a handicap or disabled person..it's so rude..I hear it everyday and it makes me so mad
-2	negative	pet-peeves	I hate this. It makes me feel like I've messed up , said the wrong thing. Or maybe they just got tired of me.
-4	negative	pet-peeves	I hate washing dishes cuz seem like eveytime i turn around there is another dish to wash and i notice my hands feel they are so dried out..i  will put on some music now and  i guess i better go do some dishes now.
-1	negative	pet-peeves	I hate when people just open up their mouths, as wide as humanly possibly, in public, just so they can inhale deeply. It's fine to yawn. Just don't open your mouth wide enough so it becomes the majority of your face. It's unattractive and unnecessary. It's a really weird, confusing pet peeve of mine, but a pet peeve nonetheless.
-3	negative	pet-peeves	I hate when people mix up to, as in "I'm going TO swim.", and too, as in "I love you TOO." Idk why it bothers me so much it just does. 
-1	negative	pet-peeves	I hate with a passion when i am accused of something i didn't do  it frustrates me NO end!!! I would rather hold my hands up and fess up. I am not a good liar so you would know if i was lying straight away anyway. x
-3	negative	pet-peeves	I have 1 friend. I woke up suddenly and realised, I want someone to be there with me every step of the way, to chat to, to care about and to just generally be around.
-9	negative	pet-peeves	I have 6 sisters and 5 brothers. My 2nd oldest brother has cerebral palsy. He can t speak like me and you but we no what hes saying. His hands and legs don t work well either. He can t swollow his spit very well and carries a wash cloth to catch the extra running down his chin. Well on the way out ,in the parking lot a person come by us and told the person they were with (that some people should leave there retarded kids at home. Thats all it took. All the older kids ran to those people and started saying things to them that made them hurry to there car and leave. From that day on if any one even looked at him wrong. They had a problem on there hands because you did nt make fun of are brother. With out having us kids in your face. 
-2	negative	pet-peeves	i have a cousin with down syndrome. actually my cousins daughter but i love her just the same. not much else to say about it.
-3	negative	pet-peeves	I have a fair bit to be rejected for, hopefully I'll find someone who will accept.
-1	negative	pet-peeves	I have a good amount of it and it grosses me out honestly -.-
-1	negative	pet-peeves	I have a lot of stories with them, Oh God they're so annoying !!
-4	negative	pet-peeves	I have always been described as responsible and dependable. Through age, I have come to resent this as people often take advantage of those traits. So if you know a responsible, strong type who is always there for others, remember a hug or a thoughtful gesture towards them may make all the difference. As sometimes, us responsible people need to be shown some love too.
-4	negative	pet-peeves	I have always loved this little excerpt, it says to me to honor also the darkness in my life that has made me who I am.. 
-6	negative	pet-peeves	I have a tendency to worry and get paranoid about every little thing and I can't stand it. Not even just in my relationship but with friends and stuff too, I always end up losing people somehow, and my boyfriend is the last person I want it happening with and I just get so scared. I know he won't ever do anything against me like that, but i've never been so scared to lose someone before. I get worried over the stupidest things, like literally the littlest things and I know its stupid but no matter how hard I try to think different and stuff I just can't change it. I can't take constantly worrying, who thought being in love could be so amazing but so scary at the same time gah 
-3	negative	pet-peeves	I have a very small family.  Just me a sister and two brothers.  We are not close at all.  I  have had to fight all my life and I guess to some to appear hard, which is so far from the truth.  Trusting people is difficult, i'm really loyal and have a tough time when it is not returned.  
-4	negative	pet-peeves	I have become offended at the term 'retarded' in recent years due to my best friend having a son with autism. The word is thrown around as if it has careless meaning, but it does and can be a very painful word to those with mental disabilities.
-4	negative	pet-peeves	I have been actively searching for a new job for 2 years now.  Before that I ran my own business and before that I ran my own division with 20 people working for me.  Substantial by our industry's standard.  Unfortunately my business was too small to absorb the economic changes (we are entirely dependent on people buying or selling homes and/or condos), like a row boat crushed under the wave of a heavy squall.  Luckily my credit didn't take too much of a hit (I was the sole guarantor).  However, with the increase reservations of lending institutions, I cannot get enough capital to restart, even as former customers call for estimates. 
-12	negative	pet-peeves	I have been a support of no abortion, however I do understand sometimes the woman believes there is no other option. That minute I try and show compassion to someone who has had an abortion, I am a cold heartless person, why is this? I am not there to judge them or to upset them I simply want to support them. Why is abortion is a no go conversation?
-3	negative	pet-peeves	I have been bullied for a while now, everyone seems to hate me. Cyber bulling is the main thing that happens in my case, all over the internet. I don't get it with these people, what's wrong with me??? I have tried suicide and cut and it's horrible, I need help!!!!
-10	negative	pet-peeves	I have been foolish enough to send naked pictures to guys because I craved their approval but it wasnt of me for who I am their approval was of my body that's all they cared about. I am better now I know who I am and don't care what others think!
-8	negative	pet-peeves	I have been married to my husband for almost 18 years in March. He was already in when we met, which was a blind date to the Marine Corps Ball. It was set up by a friend of his  and his wife that I worked with at the enlisted club on Camp Pendleton. Four months later we were married. It's had it's ups and downs, but would not change anything about our military life. He has been out since 2005, and is now in the Army Reserve, but will always consider myself a Marine wife.
-1	negative	pet-peeves	I have been taken for granted by almost everybody during my life, all my life why ? is this the tax you pay for being nice ? is this my punishment for always helping ? always being able to deliver ? so please, if you have a loved person that's always there for you, don't take them for granted because it will hurt them and if you lose them they're irreplaceable.
-8	negative	pet-peeves	I have been with my boyfriend for 2 1/2 years. We love each other dearly. But we have been fighting with his mom for 2 1/2 years now. The moment she met me she couldn't stand me. She has a son from my boyfriends dad and he is pretty much the golden child. When his brother was in middle school he was dating someone. His mom and the girl he was dating were very close. Barely knew each other and they were BFF. They would do things together and not include me.  How can I fix this mess? 
-1	negative	pet-peeves	I have been without a decent job.  
-5	negative	pet-peeves	I have decided to walk away from the phone, from facebook, from anywhere i can find someone i know  i want to escape, no turning back, go to the country, to the mountains. live alone. get away from the people that dont want me
-5	negative	pet-peeves	I have done something despicable. Something I will never be proud of in my whole life. I murdered my 17 year old neighbor. It was out of jealousy. I will never forgive myself. Ever. I still have nightmares. I just want to die now. I am an awful, disgusting person.
-2	negative	pet-peeves	I have family and friends who have disabilities and there some of the nicest people in the world so don't judge a book by it's cover
-4	negative	pet-peeves	I have fear inside about everything about my life. I'm scared to face my life after being betrayed by many people until now. Fear inside the mind will lead to negative thoughts, in turn more failures may occur. I want courage and be fearless to face this world.  Hope God will help me to come out of this situation. 
-1	negative	pet-peeves	I have gotten them my whole life. Got exposed as a baby, probably by my mom.  Oh well. 
-5	negative	pet-peeves	I have lost everything that means anything to me in life. I have lost my beloved Amy and I am not allowed to see my children, due to a vindictive ex. I live in a world of grey but try to better myself as a person every day! And I hope and dream of being reunited with my gorgeous Amy and my awesome girls!
-4	negative	pet-peeves	I have made plenty of mistakes in my life, and I continue to make plenty more each and every day. I don't keep making the same mistakes, granted. I'm not that stubborn. I prefer to make all new mistakes instead. I'm of the mentality that, as humans, we have the benefit of learning from our mistakes. Therefore I don't see my mistakes as mistakes at all. Instead I choose to see them as opportunities for me to grow a little bit more with each passing day.
-1	negative	pet-peeves	I have never been bullied, but I have seen the effects of it and it is not pretty
-1	negative	pet-peeves	I have no problem with humans, but I feel like humans are to evil by instinct, all they do is destroy, not destroy for the good of the environment, but destroy for their own needs, not considering other species.  They also have a habit of blaming things on certain animals when it's really their fault. Humans aren't that bad, they just are indistinctly and sociably "weird". Humans also like to copy other people's life, to make themselves feel "normal".    
-12	negative	pet-peeves	I have recently been interested in Demons I have no idea why but i have done research (You Tube Wikipedia Etc.) I was recently watching a You Tube video it was about a girl who was possessed and she was speaking a different language I don't know why I shared this. If you can translate this video it would be nice the video is on ProphecyFilm1's channel
-1	negative	pet-peeves	I have regrets.   Interesting to write it out. 
-9	negative	pet-peeves	I have seen this happen first hand. My bf's mom has a nerve condition and her head shakes. It's not parkinsons but she has notices it is adults that seem to make comments or stare. She understands that kids may not understand why it  happens. But it hurts her feelings when people point or stare. The thing is when I first met her I never give it a thought or looked at her any different because of her condition,just loved her for her great personality. She always has a way of turning a negative around and usually looks on the bright side,but that's bout the only thong that bugs her.
-8	negative	pet-peeves	I have six sisters so it's like my room is always being raided and my stuff is always getting stolen! I don't understand it though, why not just ask me? I'm not selfish I'll let you borrow my stuff, but I will want it back at some point. My sisters take my stuff and then hide it and never use it! Like you're not even using it because you know i'l confront you- so you steal so I can't use my stuff? I hope my sisters grow out of this! Some have learned to ask, but there's just one sister who I've confronted and she now lies about it and continues to steal. I'm so getting myself more locks for my stuff for xmas!
-1	negative	pet-peeves	I have so many things just wanting to burst out of me. But I can't get them out all that happens if I end up in tears.!             Not the best solution  
-8	negative	pet-peeves	I have to say there are lots of mistakes I have made big and small, I regret them so much, especially one, sometimes it hurts. At the end of the day I can't go back an change my mistakes but I can try and learn from them and in the future make a better job of it, or at least try. No matter how much I get judged in my mistakes and I know I do, I'm the one who has to live with it, not people who judge me, and you should never judge someone until you have walked around in their shoes. It's not fair. Life isn't fair, but if we keep our chin up and stay hopeful, things tend to look up.  Learn from your mistakes don't dwell on them too much
-7	negative	pet-peeves	I have worked in disabilities for many years and couldn't think of anything more fulfilling to do for work. Some of the best people I have known I met through this work. Two of my sons have disabilities and every day is a struggle, but I wouldn't change it for anything. They are beautiful just as they are. I have learned so much from so many people who are considered different. I love different. I am different because of you. Thank you to the different ones who made me feel like I was home!
-3	negative	pet-peeves	I just get really annoyed by people really easily. Sometimes it doesn't show but I do. It gets really bad sometimes. Like I'll get really annoyed that I'll even get upset or angry. Most of the time it's my family that annoys me. A lot of the time after I calm down I feel like it's for nothing but later on or the next day it's the same thing :/
-16	negative	pet-peeves	i just got off the phone with my sailor, and tonight i was seriously reminded of how incredibly important i am in my mans life. im his everything, the person who is always there for him, the one connection he has to home and the one who has constantly supported him since he left last march. today was a really hard day for him, some confusion with his new training command and long story short he got yelled at for about two hours so loud that the people mustering outside could hear. and although my man isnt one to cry or breakdown or be upset i could hear it in his voice that he was just so burnt out and so down. he needed me, he always needs me. hearing him say that it meant the world to him that i was there to always make him smile and stay by his side was just such an amazing feeling.  
-5	negative	pet-peeves	I just lost my rabbit, BunBun. I had had him for only 2 years- not nearly long enough. I had looked forward to a long time with my sweet little friend.R.I.P., my precious little boy
-3	negative	pet-peeves	I just started mood stabilizers and Zoloft. I know it's supposed to take some time for these to take effect, but I felt really good for the past two days. Almost back to my normal self, pre-outbursts and memory return. I have been miserable with anxiety all day and I can't sleep. Anyone have experience with meds like these?
-1	negative	pet-peeves	I just want a friend, preferably female
-1	negative	pet-peeves	I just want someone to talk to me a lot and actually care instead of talking to me and leaving.
-1	negative	pet-peeves	I just want to feel wanted
-7	negative	pet-peeves	I know a liar who likes to Smear and Shame Victims.  Even if that meant she would use Violence. At the time she was probably the worst person I thought I had met..   
-1	negative	pet-peeves	I know a lot of people that r disabled but when people bully them, I get down and dirty
-1	negative	pet-peeves	I know he used me, but I can't help but love him. 
-2	negative	pet-peeves	I know I'm still considered young but I still have a lot of regrets. Those idiotic and stupid mistakes.
-3	negative	pet-peeves	I laugh at simple mistakes and sometimes, I just laugh for no reason. But one thing that I would never forgive is laughing at people who are physically and mentally challenged.What is terrible about our human nature is we tend to seek pleasure from the misery and shortcomings of others.
-23	negative	pet-peeves	I learned life isn't promised with how many loved ones I've lost, I learned love isn't always real when he walked out that door. I learned family may not always be there when she picked drugs over me. I learned I wasn't as strong when the cuts started too become deeper or when the cravings hard started. I learned I didn't want too live anymore, when I took them pills. I cried when I wasn't successful, I was tired of the pain. I grew depressed by looking myself in the mirror, because I started too think I was the one who wasn't good enough.. Sooner or later, I decided too get help and when the help came, little by little I was realizing I was better than this life, I could break the circle. Today, I learned that nothing bad last forever & you could make it, if you really want too. I learned not too regret because everything you been there & did only made you the strong person that you are today (:
-1	negative	pet-peeves	I long to be wanted and needed, to be missed and being in someones mind when Im not around. I want to give myself away to someone who is willing to do the same for me. I want to be tangled up in a bond that no distance, no time and no doubt can break. A beacon pointing towards the better days.
-2	negative	pet-peeves	I look at what they have written and I can't read it. It reminds me of custom license plates and trying to decipher those. I just can't read most of then easily. So, I say grow up and learn proper English. 
-12	negative	pet-peeves	I lost David, the love of my life, my soul mate, my dream come true in May of 2012.  It was sudden and unexpected and completely ripped my heart out of my chest.  Someone told me several months ago that Pennies were from Heaven, I really didn't think anything of it until I actually started noticing more and more pennies in my path.  Used to be I would only pick a penny up if it were on Heads, LolChild hood idea.  But now, I look at it this way.  David throws them in my path.  When I find one, I pick it up and look up to Heaven and just smile and sometimes wink.as if to say "I am thinking about you too"  I came home one day to find about 4 pennies scattered on my kitchen floor, which to my knowledge, I had never seen before.  It was kind of cool.  So, now when I find a penny, no matter where I am, it gets picked up and stays with me.  I believe in Pennies from Heavenwithout a doubt.
-3	negative	pet-peeves	I love seeing terrorist attacks.  Plagues.  Famine.  Totalitarian governments.  Rampage shootings.  It all gives me a little hope that maybe, one day, we can wipe ourselves out.  This planet would benefit greatly from our subtraction from the equation of life. I dream of genocide.
-6	negative	pet-peeves	I'm 13 and i'm 5'5 I'm currently in 7th, I'm Latina and most Latinos are known for being short. Anyway, most people in my grade are in the 4's-5'3s. I feel so huge and uncomfortable. I just wish i was short . And everywhere i go i seem to be taller than everyone else. 
-9	negative	pet-peeves	I'm 13.. My mom is being abusive and mean to me. She takes everything from me. She thinks I'm doing bad thing witch I'm not! I'm at my breaking point. She scared away my bestfriend.. That was who helped me with everything. I just need someone to talk to or help me figure out something for me to do
-12	negative	pet-peeves	I'm 16 . I have " friends " and in that girl at school people see as the one his never lonely . Always having fun , never sad , never cries. They put this image of me in their minds & I feel I have I be that person , so I am . To them and at school at least . But being that girl gets lonely .. You have so many people that surround themselves around you but , than again you have nobody . Most of them don't know I have A's & B's . Or that I plan to go to college . I'm just that " pretty girl " .. That's all I am to them . A trophy .,
-2	negative	pet-peeves	I'm actually very quiet and reserved I'd rather answer questions than ask I'm not good on giving advise but I'm a good listener I tend to not talk to people in person I'm a loner / wallsflower but I wanna open up more I'm not shy theoretically just very reserved :/ just wanted to say some things about me!
-1	negative	pet-peeves	I'm affiliated with a bullying resource center in my area sponsors support circles to youth who experience bullying. As a facilitator to those groups, I have the training to advise and support children and youth who are in need. If anyone has any problems with bullying, please don't hesitate to inbox me.
-5	negative	pet-peeves	I'm afraid that if I try to help someone of if I try to open up that someone will tell me too shut up or that I'm a drama queen.
-5	negative	pet-peeves	I'm a little underweight and lacking vitamins and stuff, but only by a little bit. My doc says that I can take food supplements to help a little bit, but I don't have to, since my lack of vitamins is so small that it won't really affect anything, and it'll be alright as soon as my weight is alright. But to my mum, anything the doc suggests, even if he says I don't have to, becomes compulsory. She bugs me all the time after I have dinner to take a tablet, and it's so annoying. It tastes horrible and I hate swallowing tablets with water. And I hate when I'm just a little ill - like a 24 hour cold, and my mum keeps insisting that I have paracetamol. Even though I have syrup paracetamol, it tastes rancid. Ewww @.@

-4	negative	pet-peeves	I met him a year and eight days ago. We were best friends for a long time. But then I did something stupid. Now, if I'm lucky, we talk every few months.
-1	negative	pet-peeves	The REPUBLICAN 4G NETWORK!
-2	negative	pet-peeves	I'm hoping that with your experience's, that maybe you all could help me answer a question that's been going around my mind all day today. Thank you and i have enjoyed reading all your beautiful stories  xx
-3	negative	pet-peeves	I'm looking to talk to some girls. Ages 16-25. Any kind of girl. It doesn't matter about what she's into.
-1	negative	pet-peeves	I'm miserable..  Someone please talk to me.
-7	negative	pet-peeves	I'm no stranger to loss. I've lost things, contacts, or friends. But I have especially experienced a lot of deaths. I've lost most of my closest friends and family over the years. By about a couple of years ago, all my best friends and closest friends from high school had died. (I'm just 33.) All my grandparents are gone, my father, many of my uncles and my closest ones, other good friends and neighbors, my pets, and in this age, some of my closest on line friends have passed away as well. My childhood sweetheart recently passed away. One of my cousins was murdered when she was about 21, we were the same age and had the same first name but were both called by shortened nicknames. My best friend and my cousins wife, who was a mother of six, both died waiting for transplants.
-13	negative	pet-peeves	I'm not against online relationships but i prefer someone that lives in oregon USA like me. Well to start off I know what I want. I'm super picky. I know that that's bad. But I want to have a bf that I'm attractive to. So lets see: I want a boyfriend that is at least 5'8. Thin-average weight, medium-long hair, preferably a metalhead (I listen to all kinds of metal, so would be great to be able to listen to that kinda music together), I'm sorry to say thisbut I'm really only attracted to white skin guys (sorry of that sounds racist. I'm not racist I have friends of all colors)! So that's pretty much all for the look part of a bf. oh glasses would be a mega plus! yer, down to earth, not afraid to be crazy and weird in front of people. That's pretty much I can think of!
-3	negative	pet-peeves	Im so annoyed at my mum again! as mwntioned in previous bloody posts her total owing to me has GONE UP 100 DUE TO HER BEING SKINT AND TO MAKE IT WORSE ITS FRICKING OVERDRAWN IN MY ACCOUNT ALL OF IT SO IRRITATING! My sister then borrowed money from me too for a party, im like.. not like I have to fricking live! SO ANNOYING! ANYHOW NOW THEY ARE FIGHTING AND MUM WENT FOR MY SISTER. IT TOOK ALL MY STRENGTH NOT TO STOP HER! EURGGHH
-2	negative	pet-peeves	I'm so depressed, I have had her for so long.I'm crying my heart out at the moment. I feel like I am going to die
-3	negative	pet-peeves	I'm Southern. I have a very thick accent at times. When non-southerners hear this, they automatically assume I'm a backwoods, idgit. They actually speak slower like I may not understand them. It's obnoxious. Usually I wait for their insulting speech to end and then I come back at them like an auctioneer. I finish with, "Did ya get all that, darlin'?"
-5	negative	pet-peeves	I'm standing guard what I said of me starting to not liking people. The only living things I like is nature and animals. 
-5	negative	pet-peeves	I'm still in school and one of my biggest problems is feeling like I'm less important or "cool" than some people, especially older people! Like a grade or two above me. Maybe it's just me! But when I'm around them I feel like I'm so stupid and weird, and I don't know why! Some of them think they are better too.. I know we are all equal but at that time and place when I'm  with them, I don't feel equal.
-1	negative	pet-peeves	I'm tired. Tired of never being good enough. Never being skinny enough. Never being smart enough. Never being pretty enough. When will I ever be enough? For anyone?  
-3	negative	pet-peeves	I'm TOW, but unlike others' experiences here, I dont want to keep him.  I want him to go back to his family.  I don't want to see him hurt, torn, and tormented.  I never wanted him to leave his wife for me, and told him so.  Maybe because I'm more realistic than most, because deep down inside, I probably know that he wouldn't have left his family anyway, regardless of what he said.  I don't think he meant to lie or lead me on.  I know that he himself doesn't even know then that he wouldn't have the strength for it. 
-1	negative	pet-peeves	I must have sneezed, on knees I freezeyer_detailpage&v=I348b5FUDFQ
-3	negative	pet-peeves	I'm very very pale and white with brown hair. For some reason, people always are trying to figure out what race I am because apparently I look "exotic"???
-5	negative	pet-peeves	In a previous story I discussed the dangers of remaining silent when a victim is confronted with bullying. Outcomes such as social anxiety, PTSD and even death are very likely when bullying is concerned. This time however I want to look at bullying from the bystanders perspective. As usual check out the full article @  Now updated daily on weekdays!
-2	negative	pet-peeves	;( I need a gf. I wish I was good enough to have one. I just want to end it. My suicide note is written so idk maybe soon. I'm so sorry I'm going to break my best friends heart. I love her so much. I wish I could have her.  I Needed to vent so ya
-6	negative	pet-peeves	I need help paying my electric bill. Its due today or will be shut off. Im not asking anyone to give me money directly. Im not trying to scam anyone. You can go to green Mountain energy website. Im located in texas. My user name is eruiz11 and pw is R0B9X7T7. You will see im not lying about it being due. Please help on there with any amount. Please anyone who can help. Dont do it for me but for my kids. May God bless you! 
-8	negative	pet-peeves	I need some advicehow do you help friends who lost a child? A couple who is dear to me have just lost their daughtershe was born premature but was doing fine until she developed an infection and was not able to heal from itshe lived 12 daysthey just had the funeral last week thank you
-8	negative	pet-peeves	I need to know that there is hope, I've been lying for years and years. I am only 21 years old and I  I'm in an extremely serious relationship with a girl that literally means everything to me.. But of course lying has gotten in the way. Tonight she told me words meant nothing from me. Completely broke my heart because I couldn't blame her. I know I have a problem and I know I want to fix it. Please help, advice please. Thanks
-1	negative	pet-peeves	I never had a birthday party 
-1	negative	pet-peeves	I never thought i would feel this loneliness. Once i had my house full noise. How i miss that. Im divorced, children are big and family members moved away. I battle sadly every day. I come home from work to be alone. I cry in my bed every day. How I wish i could hear that noise again.
-4	negative	pet-peeves	In my email this morning were 15 messages from Psychic Source offering me 50% off their online psychic readings.If they were REALLY psychic, wouldnt they already know I dont want their crap?
-8	negative	pet-peeves	In my younger days, I was even stupider than I am now. I loved the thrill of danger. I did a few more drugs than I probably should have. The same applies to women. It made me who I am today. Without that life, I wouldn't have my kids, though. God truly can use evil to show his goodness and mercy.
-2	negative	pet-peeves	Inside bullying hides every other kind of abuse just waiting to crawl out it is the monster in the closet and the cold breath on your neck that makes you shiver in it's presence. The better person doesn't bully and the best person stops it when they see it. 
-1	negative	pet-peeves	Interesting how bullies are cool ( bad behavior by choice) but disabled people are not respected  (they were BORN disabled , NO CHOICE). The human stupidity is the final proof that the Devil exist , someone must whisper those nonsense in our ears .
-4	negative	pet-peeves	In the past, when I try to let my feelings out, especially to my family, I am always told that I am making too much out of nothing and ruining everyone's time, even if the problem is tearing me up inside. So to get along. I pretend to be okay. If I didn't, I'd have no relationships with anyone in my family.
-6	negative	pet-peeves	I often wish I could run away from everything I know and go to some isolated place where no one knows who I am. Where I don't have responsibilities and can forget all of my memories. I could be alone if I wanted to and no one would bother me. Even though I have friends and memories that I like, there isn't anything that keeps me here except for the fact that I'm too young to go anywhere.  I know that if I'm not happy here, I won't be happy anywhere else. Yet I still imagine it's possible. I just wish I could breathe again. I don't think I ever knew what that felt like.
-7	negative	pet-peeves	I once joined a debate forum online. It was fun at first, but the people really didn't know how to debate. They mostly just threw around insults and were very immature. I left the site, and then they eventually closed it.  I've noticed that some of the people on this site can be like that, too :p. But some are intelligent. Sometimes it's quite entertaining to watch people fighting on the Internet if they sound stupid enough :p.
-4	negative	pet-peeves	I once lies to my wonderful small group leaders! I said I prayed for my old friends uncle to be healthy but I didn't! I cannot believe I even shared that! They actually believed me too.
-5	negative	pet-peeves	I once met this guy on eHarmony He seemed like a real Prince charming:  kind. educated, phD Prof., employed, very nice to my daughter  I married him Only to discover he never loved me or cared about my daughter.  He is a transvestite, who was only interested in me for my clothes and a cover. He didn't bother to apologize for lying either or for being caught posting ads on craigslist for other men.
-8	negative	pet-peeves	I ordered something two day delivery from Chicago to Frederick, Md.  I ordered it December 17.  USPS lost it in Illinois.  It showed up in town on Christmas Eve.  Mark at the Frederick post office said it was on its way to my house.  It never showed up.  They ruined a nice part of my daughter's Christmas.  Shame on them.  They lied to me enough on Christmas just enough so I didn't run out and get a replacement.
-1	negative	pet-peeves	I really do the title says it all. One thing can  just tick me off
-1	negative	pet-peeves	I really miss my mom. She was 48, had me when she was 24. I'm 26, she passed when I was 23. I miss her, I want to tell her I love her.
-5	negative	pet-peeves	I regret being being too afraid of what will happen to take chances. My friend had a party last night, and I was in the last group to be leaving. Only I know that I've started to fall for him. It sounds really silly, but I regret not hugging him. I had the perfect opportunity, but I was too scared of what he would think to do it; however, it's possible that I was more awkward in the way I walked away than if I would have just went for it. In all actuality, he probably would not have thought anything about it, but I just could not bring myself to do it, for the second time now. I really wish I knew the way his arms feel around me though, so next time I have already made up my mind to do it without a second thought.
-5	negative	pet-peeves	I remember in 3rd grade, the whole class hated me (why? I have no idea). The teacher stepped out, and almost every boy got up out if their seat and chased me around the class. They caught me and beat me up. Punching and kicking and name calling.  Kids are soo mean
-5	negative	pet-peeves	I see bullying everyday  to some kid in my class but I never get bullied because I could beat up every kid in my class even boys but I'm to shy and babyish to say anything but I was bullied one time but I beat the crap out of that boy but now were friends
-2	negative	pet-peeves	I seem to have more people lying to me.. :/ they are like "oh no I haven't been talking to anyone, check my fb if u don't believe me" *logs into their fb account* 5 new messages.. Well well well what a surprise. Sick of being lied to. :/
-8	negative	pet-peeves	I see this happen all the time. My cousin has downsyndrom and I try spending as much time with her as I can. I see people walk by and laugh at some things she says, or look at her like she doesn't belong. She's a human being just like everyone else on this earth. There's plenty of people like her and people need to learn to accept people like her and other children with disabilities because they're going to see people like her all the time. She's just like everyone else, maybe slower, but she wants nth if more than to be excepted.
-5	negative	pet-peeves	I sent a package of important documents to Hawaii by Priority Air Mail from southern California. It got delivered 2 weeks later because it was shipped by Ocean freight!! I asked how it could happen and asked for a refund and was told that Priority Mail is not really guaranteed 2-3 days delivery. So no refund, even though someone obviously made a mistake by placing it on the wrong bin.
-10	negative	pet-peeves	I seriously can't stand it! I know this boy who was born with something wrong with him. A lot of people was very cruel to him but a couple of us always took up for him. He was honestly my best friend for many of years now. A lot of people just didn't have patience to try to take time to get to understand him, but if you just listened to him you would understand everything. Just because someone may have been born with something wrong with them doesn't mean they are not any different from the rest of us. They may just need people to show them more love, more attetion, and show them that people actually cares about them, and people actually just need just understand them, they are just normal people like the rest of us.
-6	negative	pet-peeves	I shared seven short, sweet years with Emma. I lost my Emma, but I am the one who feels alone. She lies in an eternal dreamy sleep and I'm part of a waking nightmare. Together for short lives.
-1	negative	pet-peeves	Is it wrong for me to want someone to love. Someone to hold my hand, tell me I'm pretty and actually think that. Someone to I can late night convos with and sends me morning texts. Is that so wrong for me to want?
-3	negative	pet-peeves	I spend a lot of time in my room because I'm tired of pretending to happy. In my room I can just listen to music and ignore everyone else
-16	negative	pet-peeves	I spend a lot of time working with special needs children and adults and I enjoy every second of it. It's a huge part of my life and probably the best one too. It makes me a better person and all I can hope is that it makes them a little happier every day too. Sure people make fun of them and usually it just bums me out that someone my age would be making fun of people who can't really defend themselves. But I know there are more people who are supportive out there and I think it's better to focus on that.
-1	negative	pet-peeves	Is seriously the worst household chore! Yucky poo
-8	negative	pet-peeves	It hates me, I know it does, it wakes me up every morning before I am ready to get up. So I slap it, and without fail it will wake me up again 9 minutes later!! Devil's spawn I know it.
-2	negative	pet-peeves	I think everyone does at some point in there life,
-5	negative	pet-peeves	I think far too many people take me for granted and one day i want to disappear and then they will realize how much they took me for granted. People expect too much of me at times and i hate it. If i was't about would they miss me or just my presence?  I think my problem i care to much for others and not enough about myself. I think in life people do take other people for granted a lot, they don't appropriate others enough which is so sad, but i guess that is life!! x
-7	negative	pet-peeves	I think I concur with many others who feel as if they wish they could start over with someone brand new.  Since my break up almost three months ago, it has been a hard and tedious journey, just to reach the goal of meeting the right woman.   This year, I was very close to my dream of marriage.  However, it wasn't meant to be.  I am hopeful and prayerful that in the coming year or years, my moment will finally arrive, and I will have the love that I have heard so much about from others who have found the love of their life. 
-2	negative	pet-peeves	I think I just accidently did the same, I was boiling water in a teflon pan and the next day I woke up to my bird dead, but the other bird seems fine, so how can I be sure it was my fault? I so distressed.. 
-12	negative	pet-peeves	I think I like this girl in school. In my first year of school, I met her in this club I joined. But I didn't had the chance to talk to her. The most was just saying hi and bye. But since she quitted whenever i see her, we just walk past each other not saying anything. But I always got this feel, like nervous or something when I see her. But we're graduating soon, and I'm afraid that I won't be able to see her again. I'm an introvert and I'm really bad at starting conversations and continuing it. What should I do
-4	negative	pet-peeves	I think I realize a key factor in what may be triggering my panic attacks. I am an emotional empath. I am strongly influenced by other peoples thoughts, energy, & emotions. I can feel what other people feel. I do not yet know how to control this ability, it is rampant & unorganized. It is a gift I do not want to loose, as I can help heal others emotional stress, but at the cost of my own. I need to learn more about myself & my inert ability. As it is becoming more prominent with age. I can make this work.
-1	negative	pet-peeves	I think it is absolutely disgusting.
-2	negative	pet-peeves	I think it's so sad that people are bullied, period. I've actually cried when watching the news about this young generation committing suicide b/c of bullying.  Maybe this is for a different experience but nonetheless, I feel very strongly about ANY ONE making fun of another human being for ANY THING, EVER.
-4	negative	pet-peeves	I think most people have a dark side it's just finding your dark side. I see my dark side not as evil but a kind of second me that occasionally comes out in things I do in life eg some of my music tastes.
-6	negative	pet-peeves	i think most people have done things they're not proud of.in the past i have cheated girlfriends,done drugs,gotten really drunk,been a rubbish father.just to name a few.you have to put these things behind you,move on & hopefully learn from these experiences.your past is history,forget about it & improve 
-7	negative	pet-peeves	I think people might be taking me for granted. They are thinking that I will always be doing that, or always be doing this. And it got me thinking, what if I died in that car accident? Then what would people be doing without me.
-1	negative	pet-peeves	It's been a tough couple of months. With the divorce finalizing, the kids starting school, me returning to work. I haven't been working at my studies like I should of. I failed psychology of learning. Bombed. Flunked. I feel terrible.
-8	negative	pet-peeves	It's been more than a year since I lost my stepmother to uterine cancer.And I would be lying to you and to myself if I said losing her didn't hurt.Well,it does.A few minutes ago I added another member to my circle who had lost her daughter to cancer at age 7,and I'm sure she's thinking about missing her child every waking and sleeping moment of her life the same way I'm thinking about the loss of my stepmother.
-10	negative	pet-peeves	It's endemic in this area! If you've ever been to Europe, you'll know old towns are full of tight bends and narrow streets. There you go round a corner and what do you see in your path? A car some idiot decided to park where it is not safe and not permitted!I can understand a badly parked delivery van. If you've got a tight schedule and deliver things for a living, carrying heavy stuff from the parking lot may not be a pleasant thing to do. Work is work. But there's no excuse for other cases. Especially when a lazily parked car will slow down or stop emergency vehicles.
-1	negative	pet-peeves	It's good to mend things up with love and care, no matter how much distance has been created. Sometimes, walking away is the best solution.  
-2	negative	pet-peeves	It's not cool. Be nice. You have no idea what people are going through.
-5	negative	pet-peeves	It's not even that I want a relationship necessarily. It just seems as though everyone has a 'best friend' or a really close group of friends, that's all I want really. Well, it would be nice.
-2	negative	pet-peeves	It's totally irrational and probably childish but it drives me to distraction if I am dialing a number I don't know manually,  and it is then engagedDon't they know I am calling, really, and if I do get through do not andIi mean DO NOT force me to listen to elevator music  I would rather watch paint dry or stick a chilli in my eye. Silly little things but they drive me to the point of mad distraction - don't figure as nothing else ever phases me
-8	negative	pet-peeves	Its wrong to make fun of other people no matter what. I had a friend in high school that dropped out cause of people picking on him for his size. He was an awesome person. Funny, charming, honest, and caring. After he dropped out we lost contact.  When I see an elderly person in a store and there trying to get something off the shelf Ill ask them if they need help. I do that alot no matter if Im in a hurry or not. My youngest daughter is starting to do it too.
-5	negative	pet-peeves	It was 2 months ago. I was at my monthly gum scaling for my gum disease. Well this time my dentist decided to not numb me. As I cried he cut my gums. Not cool bro.
-10	negative	pet-peeves	I unfortunately underestimated a liar. This liar swore that everything that came out of his mouth was the truth and I let him go on without stopping him. I brought this person into my life thinking that he would be a good friend. Now I'm dealing with the consequences. So my advice is cut them out of your life before it escalates like my situation did. I not only lost a good friend but I am also emotionally drained because of this person.
-2	negative	pet-peeves	I used to get close to people quickly now I don't, the fear of being blissfully happy installs fear and dread inside me incase it's taken from me again.
-4	negative	pet-peeves	I used to have Bels palsy (half of my face wouldn't move), and I know first hand that it hurts to be made fun of for something wrong with you. I am now Bels palsy free, and soo happy. But anyone else out there with diseases or are disabled shouldn't be treated with disrespect.
-5	negative	pet-peeves	I used to volunteer at an equestrian center where people with disabilities could ride horses and gain motor and social skills. Working with the autistic kids was the highlight of my dayjust getting to see them smile laugh and have a good time always made me feel better and know I was doing something good.
-12	negative	pet-peeves	I use to do it and looking back at old messages, I can't even read them. I have trouble reading other people's messages when they use text speak. What is so hard about taking an extra second to type properly? I'm not talking about typos I'm talking about whn ppl tlk lik ths bc thy to lzy to typ out wrds and whn thy use ur. Took me 2 minutes to type that. It makes people look uneducated. When someone messages me and says "how was ur day" I automatically think "great an idiot" I probably am too judgmental but it's very annoying. Speak the bloody queens English!!!
-3	negative	pet-peeves	I'v been bullied,  You know your time has come! 
-4	negative	pet-peeves	I've always been afraid of sunflowers. They give me the creeps. They give me goose bumps. I think they're ugly. I always have. I just think because I have an overactive imagination, growing up I always thought the middle would turn into a pencil sharpener and eat my face. Plus the middle is so I don't know. Ew. I just really am repulsed by them.
-4	negative	pet-peeves	I've always felt alone. Even at times with a crowd of friends, I still am alone within myself. I function within this world but don't feel I'm a part of it.
-4	negative	pet-peeves	I've always told the Truth because I have no reason to lie, and I know technically bending the Truth or leaving out Facts is borderline lying, but I realistically only do that to protect someone, or keep an important secret. Generally I'm not afraid to be blunt or express myself, and I expect the same of others. I am polite around family, friends, and in public, I'm not one of those people who acts blunt everywhere to be rude or start something.
-3	negative	pet-peeves	I've been a beach girl my whole life. I'm pale and burn so easy but I love the sun and warmth of it. I like to lay in the sand and just soak up vitamin D.
-9	negative	pet-peeves	I've been bullied. And I stood up for a girl once cause they knocked her over and stepped on her books. I told them to stop, and after that I got bullied more. All I was trying to do was to stand up for the girl. What did she do? Nothing. They just didn't like the way she looked, and that she was in special ed classes. Were all human and should be treated the same.
-6	negative	pet-peeves	I've been going through some particularly difficult times at the moment in the usual infj ways but it always gives me so much comfort to rediscover my infj-ness here and it makes me remember that it's a pretty unique and special world to inhabit.  at times it can be hard not to despair and become caught up with the endless anxiety and suffering we stir up in ourselves but knowing there are others out there who just get like me is pretty wonderful 
-4	negative	pet-peeves	i've been thinking and i found that i am so selfish, rude and arrogantno wonder why most people dont like me.
-2	negative	pet-peeves	I've been waiting for my dealer for 3 days now. Please, will him to call me.
-4	negative	pet-peeves	I've learned in my life that no matter how much women claim to love unconditionally, they are full of crap. I've tested a lot of women and every one of then loved my personality, my character, my charisma and said I knew how to turn them on like nobody's business. However, once I show them a picture of me, their whole thought process changes and I'm immediately demoted to garbage status. I refuse to ever send a fake pic of myself but I also wait to send my real one. I don't use anything to deceive or give any false impression that I'm some hot guy but I just be myself.
-4	negative	pet-peeves	I've never been on a gym before i am 5'3 at 160 pounds i want to weigh 120 by July this year. Can someone give me advise on what to eat and exercises to do.
-7	negative	pet-peeves	I want to get out of here. Out of my house, city, school, everything. I don't feel like I belong here, and I wish I could just move to a new city and start over. People know things about my past and assume things about me or think I am weak. They think I'm still sick. They think I'm fragile. They see my scars and they run away. They stare. I think if I could get away people would judge me for me, not my past.
-17	negative	pet-peeves	I want to like them. And I doat a distance. But I don't think I'll ever get over the disappointment that always seems to follow after someone opens their mouth and starts talking to me. I suppose it's a lot better than being sneered at by people I don't know whenever I go somewhere, which is usually the case, but barely. People are just so unfriendly, and then the people that actually do come up and try to talk to me are self-absorbed a-holes or complete lunatics. I would like people a whole lot more if they weren't so full of themselves and weren't trying so hard to impress other people all of the time. I have absolutely no interest in conversation with strangers anymore because of this.or people in general really, even the ones I know. I already know it won't be a conversation but rather a sales pitch to try and get me to buy into thinking that whoever is talking to me is cooler than everyone else I know or will know. It's painful to watch really.and quite boring. 
-12	negative	pet-peeves	I was bullied in primary school. Not for the whole time I was there, but for quite a while and it was all because I put on weight. I had 3 friends and then that slowly turned into 2. None of the other girls in my class liked me. No one wanted to work with me. No one wanted me on their team in p.e. it was two boys in particular who used to call me fat all the time and they would always make fun of me and no one would stick up for me which then lead to me having no confidence which still effects me today. I hate myself because I have no self esteem and this is all because of those two boys in my primary school.
-10	negative	pet-peeves	I was bullied physically and mentally when I was younger. School is supposed to be a safe place for kids to learn and grow with friends, and that's why I think my bullying was the hardest on my mother. She couldn't do anything about the fact that I came home crying everyday. As many calls and visits to the school as she made, nothing ever changed until I left. I'm better now, for the most part. It was a long time ago. That's why I hate bullying.
-20	negative	pet-peeves	I was diagnosed with PTSD in 2009 after I was shot by my ex boyfriend and then watched him kill himself. I was one of those people who believed only soldiers could get something like that. Boy was I ever wrong I have nightmares, sweats, daymares ( lol ), insomnia, anger with no cut off point. The list could really go on. I never really knew how bad it was until I started seeing my ex everywhere, everything people said were like words coming out of his mouth. I replayed that night countless times. I became another personI haven't been the same since. The person I am now is ready to battle the world if I have to. I think I'm mad all the time. I do have problems being at home alone and in places alone full of strangers. At times I feel like one of my children, needing someone to hold their hand. I constantly think and feel like someone is after me. There is not a day that goes by that I don't. I've enrolled in college, but my daily battle isn't going to let me go I don't belive.
-7	negative	pet-peeves	I was fired from a job because inappropriate behavior but it all really started because I distanced myself from the crowd.  I unfriended three people from a social media site because seeing their business was starting to hurt me.  I felt like I was saving myself from the temptation of stalking them but they saw if as me being rude and hurtful.   I regret the lost of this one woman who was really there for me and there's nothing I can do to get her friendship back.  She I wish that I could find a way to tell her sorry and that I really wished that we could be friends again.  I really don't think she'd care though.
-18	negative	pet-peeves	I was in a relationship and I had went to Florida with a friend my ex girlfriend was back home where I lived and I found out, she cheated on me with my guy bestfriend. He called me crying telling me what happen, and how it all went down. Then I had asked her and she lied to me about it and said it never happened I knew she lied about it cause he send me screen shots of the conversation after it all happen. I also caught her when I came back from Florida that my guy bestfriend was In the back of my house and she came over, saw him and was like " isn't that the hat I saw when I was in your room" I looked at her and asked her "when was you in his room" she responded "don't worry about it, it wasnt that serious" we got into a huge argument and I just wanted away. Till this day she says it never happened But why lie when I already know the truth?
-6	negative	pet-peeves	I was left home alone for like 3 hours this morning and I decided why not try decorate a little. So I did. I liked it. It was nice. And pretty. Anyways. My parents come home and go ew take it down. It doesn't match. It looks ugly. Like what the heck. Okay. I don't need this I went to my room and I'm still giving my mom a little attitude. Seriously? I should've never tried to help.
-4	negative	pet-peeves	I was not born in America but I have to say, but I am a legal citizen and I have paid my dues to be an American! People who are not legal really need to go back to where they came from! Come on, you douchebags! I don't want to see you taking my jobs away from me! It's unfair and you don't belong in this country!
-3	negative	pet-peeves	I was sitting around recently and I got to thinking and came to one conclusion: It must be rough to be a moderator on a large social media or forum ba It's at the bottom of the front page!
-3	negative	pet-peeves	I was tracking my package on amazon, & it said that the Postal Office in my own city had received it. Expecting it the next day, I was saddened not to see it on my doorstep. Where was it? In the  city 40 minutes away. Apparently the transfer was to there, for no absolute reason. Delaying my package for another week.  Never again. 
-10	negative	pet-peeves	I was very little, and like most preschoolers, I was learning the ropes of life. I went to the park with my mom. I lived in a fairly young neighborhood, and when I say that I am talking about the people who inhabited it. That being said the creature I saw in front of me was quite unusual. The was a very tall man standing in front of me,  only his hair seemed to be missing. I laughed and pointed and screamed and probably cried a little. I was screaming at him and at my mom like he was a monster. Now, fast forwarding 10 years, I think back and feel overwhelmingly bad for this man, because he had recently gone through chemo, and I probably made him feel incredibly depressed. When I tell my friends about this we all joke around about how it wasn't that bad, but really this stranger was probably heart broken/ devastated by me and my indecency. I still feel remorse after another 10 years.
-8	negative	pet-peeves	I was walking down the street a little girl bumped into me and she kep on staring at me and I asked r u ok then she started cried and she ran.then I asked wat did I do
-4	negative	pet-peeves	I weigh 106 pounds but I still feel fat! and I've been bulimic before I just want to get to like at least 98 pounds, can someone help me, I eat healthy and stay fit so it won't be unhealthy.. does anyone have any tips or something that might help?
-4	negative	pet-peeves	I went to the cinema alone today. No one else was there by themselves I felt so lonely  Does anyone else go to the cinema alone?
-2	negative	pet-peeves	I wish i could start over i miss my ex i cry over her ever night even tho she has moved on and its been a year my depression slowly takes over but i dont think i can hold on i wish i could start over do everything over with her agin
-11	negative	pet-peeves	I wont lie, I am having the hardest time being away from my marine.  THEN, My marine started asking me the other dayif I would ever get married and move to Cali with him. Of course I was straight freaking out, breathing got heavy, mind got foggy, butterflies going crazy, and smiling like a maniac. I know he was probably just feeling things out so I wont jump the gun but I also have never had a bf that thinks about getting married more than I do. He justmakes me feel special. 
-19	negative	pet-peeves	I would love to go on a date but do it my way. When im a little older and I have money like I know I am, I wanna go to a bar and find a man and ask him out. He's hopefully gonna say yes and I will get his number and leave. Then a couple weeks later call him up and tell him to put on something nice cause we're going out. Ill go pick him and knock on the door walk to the car open his side let him get in and then i'll get in and drive to the fanciest restaurant around. (not red lobster either) I mean F A N C Y ! We'll eat, I'll pay the bill and we can drive around or go to the beach or to a bar and just talk and get to know each other. I'll take him home, get out the car open his door walk him all the way to the door and drive home. I wanna be the perfect gentlemen type lady if that makes sense lol. But next time I expect that from him! That's my dream date to take a man out. 
-2	negative	pet-peeves	I wouldn't say i regret it . I have definitely learned over the years that we all can make mistakes , and its okay. I learn from the past and work for the present hoping fir the best . Thats the recipe for success ^^
-7	negative	pet-peeves	I would tell the little girl I was to be brave. I would tell her the beatings won't last forever and one day freedom will be yours. You'll wake up to home that is your own, with no one to make you cower in fear. I'd tell her to to remember to remain fearless and love without holding back.
-10	negative	pet-peeves	Just got off of Skype with my amazing soldier. &lt;3 He always finds a way to put a smile on my face no matter what! His sergeant (who calls me kitkat lol) is requesting that I send them a ton of kitkats for valentines day. haha I lovee how supportive & helpful his unit has been to not only me but to Brandon. They help him out SO much with everything its ridiculous. The bond between a soldier and their unit is incredible. I can't wait till they all come home in December and I get to personally meet every one of them finally  
-4	negative	pet-peeves	Just had a panic attack. That thing hurts. It's time to make a trip to the doctor bc they are getting worst. I felt it in my chest n I began trembling
-2	negative	pet-peeves	Just took the 41q.com personality test with the result: Outgoing and with people skills, it is very true, but i still dont like people..
-3	negative	pet-peeves	Kids, now what comes to mind when you think of kids, not goats. I'm sick of sitting having a coffee, while kids are climbing over everything, including the counters and tables.
-4	negative	pet-peeves	Last summer when my best friend and I watching movies we kissed and touched but then I told him to left my house I feels guilty
-9	negative	pet-peeves	Last week I took about 40 various pills in hopes to kill myself but I dozed off and woke up throwing up everywhere. I told my family I ate something bad and it must have made me sick. I only told 2 people what really happened but they seem to think it was by accident and I didn't want to die. I'll just let them think that but they are in for a big surprise..
-2	negative	pet-peeves	Last year my best friend committed suicide, she was beautiful and the one person who was truly there for me 24/7  I miss you so much, Kathryn you were such a great person and I'm happy as long as you are happy &lt;3 you gorgeous x
-4	negative	pet-peeves	Lately it just feels like I have no one to talk to. My friends and family are usually supportive but, it feels like they're getting sick of my constant mopeyness. I need someone who want judge me
-3	negative	pet-peeves	Lately I've been really annoyed with myself and everyone around me. I'm not sure why. Perhaps I'm in need of a change. School is coming up and i'm not so happy about that. Nothing okay anymore and i just need some new friends.
-2	negative	pet-peeves	Liar Liar pants on fire.. you make me want to puke. 
-1	negative	pet-peeves	Like really?? What if that was you? Think of how it feels
-6	negative	pet-peeves	Living in fear is not something anyone wants to do. Especially when it comes to finances. Not having the money to pay rent. Not having the money to pay for schooling. Not having the money for transportation. Not having the money to purchase food. Not having money to provide for your family You work hard, day after day, only to have to spend your hard earned money on bills and taxes, not being able to afford the things you need I just thought to share my experience, as it is not just me who can attain this goal, but anyone with the will to do so, and quite frankly, I want to be the one to help anyone who needs it. Just ask me about it, I'd love to help you out ^_^
-2	negative	pet-peeves	Lost my brother, my best friend to cancer. It will be 8 years this August. It hurts so much! I miss him so badly!! 
-1	negative	pet-peeves	MAJORITY of the time I don't know why we are all full of ourselves XD but by not talking sometimes we could solve many issues problem is some people never shut up.
-2	negative	pet-peeves	making friends here is harder than we think! 
-2	negative	pet-peeves	Man I just hate them they r so annoying and if u lie to me I will figure it out and block u right away sorry but that is the truth
-2	negative	pet-peeves	Mean people used to see their original face and identity before this mirror.They just see their own mental disability before before this mirrors.  
-3	negative	pet-peeves	Most people on EP prefer money over love. I'd like to shove my arm way up these people's arses. They're exactly what makes me lose hope in humanity.
-4	negative	pet-peeves	Most repeated or bodily noises irritate me extremely easily but silence makes me just as irritated.  What is my life !?
-4	negative	pet-peeves	My aunt is a compulsive liar. I hate it. About 90% of what she says is a lie. If there's anything I hate worse than ANYTHING, it's liars. I still have to pretend to love her, and deep down I do, because she's actually a pretty decent person other than that. If you look past her addictions. Ugh my family is so dysfunctional. And I love this website. 
-3	negative	pet-peeves	My aunt is mentally retarded, and there are several kids at my school with disabilities. The kids I know are so sweet and kind, and it makes me so sad to see anyone treat another human badly. Disabled people need our help, and we can't start by making fun of them.
-9	negative	pet-peeves	My best friend died of Leukemia last April, and I found this post on her Facebook wall not too long ago. It made me cry, and it really hit home for me, because I feel this way all the time "Since when have our lives become so routine? The same thing, everyday. What happened to the magic, to the wonder of each day? My childhood is already fading away and I never even noticed until my best friend said something. One last question remains in the end. Can we ever return to the view we had as a small child, that every day is an adventure just waiting to be found?" She had such wisdom, and I always admired her for it. I wish I could talk to her again, even if just one more time It hurts to know that she'll never have the chance to find new wonder and beauty in life, and find her childhood feelings again. But I'm going to try. For her. For me. For both of us. Rest in peace my sweet guardian angel!!!!
-7	negative	pet-peeves	My best friend is moving to Canada in 2 days. He is not only my best friend but the love of my life. We spend every single day together. He lives with me. I have no idea how I am going to handle this. I thought I would be ok and had accepted it. But the past 2 days every time he hugs me I just start balling. I really don't think I will ever meet such a person. I want him to be happy and follow his dreams but I don't know how to live my life with out him. It feels like I won't be living my life with out him here.
-4	negative	pet-peeves	My best friends daughter is disabled. Long before her I've always had a soft spot for this topic. We as society should be helping each other. I love the term "it takes a village"
-2	negative	pet-peeves	My bf of 9 months lied to me and cheated on me for 4 months! I had never felt so used and heart broken in my life!
-5	negative	pet-peeves	My boyfriend accused me of lying about going to a job interview because I didn't come home with any papers from them. They are supposed to be calling me to set up orientation because they offered me the job. He said, "Yeah, I'll believe that when I see it"
-11	negative	pet-peeves	My boyfriend has been in San Diego for almost a month now and I can't tell you how excited I am to get to see him graduate. The letters are what keeps me going these days. And when it comes to graduation, I've been looking up dress code ALOT. I know the proper attire from the USMC site and everyone here says go comfy. Personally I'm a converse kind of girl anyway, so shoes isn't my problem, the rest of the outfit is. I'm stuck between a dress or just a normal outfit. (Jeans, a nice shirt, etc.) help! I don't know if I should maybe get a cute dress and just save it for the graduation day? 
-5	negative	pet-peeves	My boyfriend lost someone very close to him a few months ago to suicide (we think). I have no idea what to say or how to help. He keeps everything bottled inside so I never really know what's wrong. I get impatient sometimes and try to push him to get over it for my own selfish purposes. I miss us being happy all the time. He's not depressed all the time but it's the majority of time. What can I say/do to maybe help him feel better? Other than sit by and be his shoulder to cry on, I have no idea what to do. It's very frustrating at times and the death of his friend has kind of put a wedge between us.
-3	negative	pet-peeves	My boyfriend usually makes me wait whenever we're going to meetso i let him wait too whenever i go to washroom at malls :D i don't intend to do it, i really am just one of the queens who used to stay long at washrooms and take a bath for as long as 2 hoursminimum of 30 mins as my fastest in which i can only do shampoo my hair and that's all :D if i wash my bodyit would take more than 30 minutes :D (back to my boyfriend) the reason for this is because he will always ask me if i'm in one specific place where he will only go when i get there already. Althoughfor almost 3 years of us being togetherhe's now practicing to be as early as possible. He's considering the traffic, but always late, still!
-6	negative	pet-peeves	My brother has been bullied all through his years in school and me being older, I hated never being able to do anything about it. I just honestly never understood why my brother never did anything about it. I mean i'm sure he was half the kid's size. He would always just say he didn't want to be like they were. He's a good kid and people who bully need to open their eyes and realize that the attitude they have isn't going to get them anywhere in life..
-2	negative	pet-peeves	My brother keeps telling me to commit suicide  Like 100 times a day, no exaggeration.
-10	negative	pet-peeves	My cat Sonny was 13 (104 in cat years) when he died on March 24, 2013. I still remember when we first got him 9 years ago, his owners across the street couldn't keep him when they moved so they asked us to keep him. I remember how he thought he was so tough because he beat up all the other cats in the neighborhood. I remember when we kept him outside in a mini cat bed/house and he would keep us up with his whining to come in. I remember how 6 days ago he was perfectly finethen 4 days later things didn't look so good. I remember when my parents came home that night and said they had to put him down.        Kittens128
-14	negative	pet-peeves	My cousin Charlie just passed away. I'm having a really hard time. He was a great, funny, amazing guy. He was only 18. He didn't deserve to pass that way. I basically grew up with him. Ever since we were little Charlie always had a nickname for me. "Hey Little Rainy." His voice still in my head. The times and memories we shared play through my head. As soon as i get close to forgetting about what happened it comes right back. To think my life couldn't hate me anymore than it didnow i have to live without my cousin &lt;3.   R.I.P. Charlie &lt;3 I love you &lt;3
-2	negative	pet-peeves	My dearest friend in the whole world lives on the other side of the planet - literally. 12-13 hour time difference, depending on whether we're in Daylight Saving Time here in the USA. But we hang in there. No obstacle is insurmountable if you want it badly enough.
-1	negative	pet-peeves	My Dell notebook computer was stolen a year ago. I bought two 2nd hand ones before getting a Toshiba notebook for a fair price. I need a computer expert to help me.
-6	negative	pet-peeves	My ex-girlfriend did that. It annoyed the crap out of me. She sometimes ended up misspelling simple words. I told her about it and it slowed, but it didn't stop. So I stopped responding to her "text-talks". Things didn't end well. Oh well.
-8	negative	pet-peeves	My friend, you are one of the smartest guys I know. But there are a few things I need to tell you. If you think it doesnt hurt to not talk to you, youre wrong. If you think my heart doesnt ache to see you and not say anything, youre wrong. If you think I dont notice when you log on and off, youre wrong. If you think that I dont stare at your name, hoping youll just say hi, hoping somehow, you can understand what I'm thinking, youre wrong. Me
-1	negative	pet-peeves	My hubby and precious soulmate of 43 years passed away 4 months ago.        Great expectation of reuniting with my one and forever. Sweet heart.
-4	negative	pet-peeves	My husband likes to look at other women online. We have only been married 5 months and hes done it countless times (that I know of) iv spoken to him and told him how it makes me feel and he seems sorry only to do it again. I suggested watching it together but he said no. I feel less and less attractive every day and more and more anger towards him for how he's making me feel. Am I wrong to be upset?
-2	negative	pet-peeves	My husband of 14 years died on March 15, 2013 of a massive heart attack the kid's and I found him we have a 12 and a 9 year old together the pain that we feel is over whelming w e didn't know when we woke up that morning are whole lives where gonna change forever he is my best friend the only man I will truly love forever 
-17	negative	pet-peeves	My junior year in highschool I met this girl Sam. She's really pretty, fun to be around and all that. We'd been talking for a couple months and one afternoon she asked me "How would you feel if you got put in the friend zone?". Me being the idiot, i thought she was asking a general question. So i said it wouldn't bother me too much. 2 weeks later I tried to tell her how i felt about her and she told me it was too late because of what i said before. I just graduated high school 2 months ago and it still hurts me to think about it.  She has a boyfriend, she moved on a LONG time ago and I know I should have but I just cant. I feel like the only way to get over the situation is to meet new people but I'm really shy and i just don't know how to solve this.
-5	negative	pet-peeves	My little sister is 6 years old and has become accustomed her "lying stage". No matter what comes out of her mouth these days it's a lie. My father's (yes i have two dads) and my siblings and I are trying to just ignore what she says but it's horrible how she tries to blame people and lie about people behind their backs nowadays. I don't know what to do. I can't wait until she's a little more mature and then maybe we'll get along more when she stops lying. This is one of my biggest pet peeves: LYING!
-6	negative	pet-peeves	My man is in Afghanistan now and won't be back until October. Some call it crazy, but I call it love. There are good days and bad days. Even good minutes and bad minutes. I think it's shameful when girls pretend they love a military man when all they do is complain and cheat. Be supportive and faithful! He's a hero. He should be yours.
-11	negative	pet-peeves	My mom and two of my siblings are borderline. None of them are willing to get help for it. And they feed off from each other on a daily basis. Unfortunately I am disabled and very dependent on them for help day to day. I try to find ways to separate myself from them (activities outside of the home) but because of my condition, I can no longer drive very often on my own so it is pointless to have my own car. My mom is very manipulative about allowing me to use hers. Things like this (as I am sure anyone here can contest) is what just adds to my daily stress of having to deal with them. The thing is they all act like they don't even seem to care that I am very sick and the way they act is making me worse. I don't know what to do. I've tried going to therapy, reading books. I think the only way I am going to get away from them is if I get into a relationship but its hard enough to date when you aren't sick
-1	negative	pet-peeves	My mom left me when I was 10 and people hate me and I smetimes cut myself and have no friends..
-3	negative	pet-peeves	My mother passed on 08/14/13 this past Wednesday . This morning as I was walking up the steps to my office I found a penny on heads..  who knew that a penny could bring so much joy! 
-2	negative	pet-peeves	My name is Wilder my sister is Lennox and my brother is Finnegan (Finn) lol i will never get a keychane with my name
-22	negative	pet-peeves	My older brother Raphael passed away when I was 12 and he was 14. I remember that day so well. It was one of the times that our father had kicked us out of the house. My other brothers were at work, so it was just me and him. It had been snowing all day and the temperature was well below freezing even though it was only about noon. Neither of us had our coats, we had been shoved out the door before we could get them. Raph was tough, he wanted to stick it out in the shed in the back yard, but I insisted that we go somewhere warm. I eventually wore him down and we decided to walk the half-mile from our house to the auto shop where our older brother Michael worked. When it was slow he would sneak us in the back and let us sit in the room where they stored the parts.  If you actually managed to get to the end of this thing, I thank you. I have never actually told anyone all of this, in all of this detail. It's good for me I think. 
-2	negative	pet-peeves	My only wish is to go back in time and set my life straight. Impossible wish.
-1	negative	pet-peeves	My parents are great at these.  Not referring to anyone on here, just a couple of people I know in real life!
-2	negative	pet-peeves	My partner eats really unhealthy food and it  annoys me that he doesn't bother that much about his well being. Do I have grounds to actually find that annoying? Or am I being unnecessarily fussy.
-3	negative	pet-peeves	My reason for hating people who make fun of disabled kids might be just alittle biased. I am disabled myself. I have been blind since birth. I have been the kids' tormented object. I have been pushed, laughed at, made fun of, and many other things. This is not about me however. I believe that no one deserves to be stared at, and made fun of. Least of all disabled people. As the world becomes more knoledgeble you would think people wouldn't be so rude, and ignorant. They still don't understand change. The only change they get are the ones on facebook. Kids aren't judged as much for the color of their skin anymore. Why can't disabled people have a civil rights movement? Why can't we fight back?
-11	negative	pet-peeves	My sister is special needs and I am the oldest. My parents have said I will take care of her when they're gone. And, I want it that way. I do not want her in a home. I love her.  I would die for her.  I would. My mom has said, "she's not your responsibility." And I know what she's saying but I can't abandon my sister. At the same time, I want to do things. I want to travel, establish a career, be successful. I was the first person in my family to get a college degree. I want to build on that.  I want to take care of her but I want things for myself. Is that selfish? Can I do both? Take care of my sister and still be the woman I want to be? I feel my life has been chosen for me.
-4	negative	pet-peeves	My step sister isn't my cup of tea. She's always trying to make me jealous of her and she always has to rub the slightest things in. I'm not one to get jealous anyway but she's so competitive and even tries hurting me if she lost against me at something. I don't know whether to tell her about all my lovely holidays over the past to make her jealous (she gets jealous very easily) or just tell her I'm not jealous of you and never will be. Please give me advice on what to do, it's getting me down a bit because I always feel like she's going to brag whenever I see her. Any help will be very good xx
-4	negative	pet-peeves	My teenaged son and I were at Walmart and a physicaly disabled woman was trying as hard as she could to push a cart she had a caregiver with her. We stepped aside and yeilded the right of way to both of them. A girl of 10 or 11 mocked the way the disabled woman walkedand her mother laughed. I hope I never see that woman or her rude daughter again.
-11	negative	pet-peeves	My younger sister was adopted at birth.  Her and my brother were twins.  My parents decided to keep Nathan and they literally abandoned Lee in hospital when she was a baby.  Lee found us at the beginning of the year, unfortunately soon after she found us she was diagnosed with cancer and she passed away in April.  I never got to know her.  Nathan spent a bit of time with her before her death.  I came back to South Africa on the 1st of June and on his way to the airport to pick me up Nathan died in a car accident.  I am completely devastated.  Both of them are gone and I never had the opportunity to say goodbye.  
-1	negative	pet-peeves	Nobody asked to born like that..
-1	negative	pet-peeves	Nobody really knows the real me&nbsp;
-2	negative	pet-peeves	No one should be used to being broken up with, it should be a heart breaking experience and something that happens. I've been left so many times that I'm used to it. And that's sad
-1	negative	pet-peeves	no, patience is not one of my features has never been and it will never be If i want something, i want it NOW
-3	negative	pet-peeves	Not gonna lie, I read some peoples stories and wanna tell them how amazing they are for being able to get through what they do but I get lazy and just end up heart-ing it. As a matter of fact this is kinda long for me now. Lol phones and texting  id rather talk lol
-1	negative	pet-peeves	Nothing good ever comes from a bucket. That is all there is there to say. 
-3	negative	pet-peeves	I was never bullied until I reached High School, my first experience with other children my age. I feel like this describes the experience pretty well.
-2	negative	pet-peeves	October 15,2010 and January 12,2012 is the saddiest day in my life. Because on October 15,2010 my lab. Dog Swetty was died because she was hit by car. And last night my terrier puppy named pacman/paccy was also gone because he was sick and ofcourse I'm trying not to cry but I can't stop not to cry. And for me it's really hurt when you lose someone in your life and now Eventhough I'm deeply sad and hurt. I'm just pretending that Im going to be ok and everybodys gonna be fine.
-1	negative	pet-peeves	Oh how my heart aches today! When are you going to figure this out?
-12	negative	pet-peeves	Okay, might be an old saying, like super old like ancient. BUT it totally applies here. What would you want someone to do if you were in that case? Answer your text right? Like respond? Like saying something? LIKE NOT LEAVE YOU FREAKING HANGING FOR HOURS IF NOT DAYS??? *sigh* Okay sorry, rant done. lol Look, I understand that people get busy. Work, school, emergencies, etc. They totally happen. But, except for the last example there, there is always that little period at the end of the day right before bed when you should CHECK YOUR PHONE and see if anyone was trying to get in touch with you. And then, here's the kicker, answer. Not a long answer, not anything elaborate. You're tired, you need sleep, long day. Yeah, fine, makes sense. But ANSWER! Say, "Hey, nice to hear from you" or "Sorry, I really need some sleep, I'll text you tomorrow" or "LOL Texting is fun! But I'm done for the day, sorry. ttyt". Not so hard right? Right? Good! Then do it!!! Thank you, that is all. :p
-6	negative	pet-peeves	Ok it's not the worst thing but what really gets me mad is when it says the person has read or opened your message and they don't message back. It's like really!!!!
-10	negative	pet-peeves	Omg yes! I hate dishes especially after I just wash them. Like one minute I was dishes and then the next minute there's a whole bunch of dirty dishes. I'm like what the heck really?! It's so funny because my mom is like an expert at washing dishes. I take forever but at least I still wash them. Unfornately my dish washer doesn't work so I wash dishes by hand.
-2	negative	pet-peeves	one might argue we're not that valuable.  so you have to ask yourself: where does your control begin and end ? do you even have any kind of control ?
-1	negative	pet-peeves	One of my closest girlfriends has 3 daughters under the age of 4 which is quite a handful at the best of times. However her kids do not understand the words 'no, don't touch, please, thank you, stop it or do as your told'. In fact they completely run amok whether they are at home, in public or visiting. 
-2	negative	pet-peeves	One thing I can't stand about most parties that it all about drinking.  This is why they don't interest me.  Yes I know there is some parties there no drinking going on but this is very rare.
-1	negative	pet-peeves	One week ago my cat passed away in an accident No idea how I am going to make it past this 27 hours or so  beginning from now.
-3	negative	pet-peeves	Online bullies, you know who you are. You sit behind a computer because you think you have the anonymity to sit behind a computer screen and type your poison at people who've never done you any harm. How 'brave' you are! such courage! NOT! 
-1	negative	pet-peeves	Or just one or two people in particular. Otherwise I have no restrictions. I don't have many things people would like to touch anyway.
-11	negative	pet-peeves	Other peoples kids The other night I took my girls to church for family night.  Generally the kids are a little excited, but I thought they behaved respectfully  Last night I was asked to help out as 1 worker did not show up, and boy were my eyes opened.  I must say, my girls 7 & 5 were very good, but some of the other kids were terrible. I was amazed if any of my kids had behaved even a fraction of this way, we would have made a long trip to the bathroom to discuss it.  I am still in shock.  I told my girls how proud I was that they behaved.
-11	negative	pet-peeves	Our beloved Booker , less than a year old died on Friday 6/25/10. It is like a horrible dream and I hear the sound of the impact in my head over and over. I am asking God for peace and comfort in this time , but I know it will be with me forever. He was the sweetest 80 pound pit bull/ yellow lab/ German Shepard. What a mix. I went to walk him and before I could get the leash on him he bolted into the street because he saw the dog park on the other side.Totally my fault and my wife and son are paying the price. I love you Booker and I am sorry
-4	negative	pet-peeves	People always assume I watch sports because I play so many. Watching sports gets so boring. I barely even watch the big event ones like Super Bowl or World Series.. I mean these events aren't an every-day/week thing so they don't get as boring, but it's still the same thing--Sitting and watching people who get paid millions of dollars to play a sport and still make stupid and annoying mistakes. No fun. Lol. 
-2	negative	pet-peeves	People annoy me. Enough said -.-
-10	negative	pet-peeves	People follow a strict series of protocols and procedures when interacting, and i HATE those protocols, it means i have to listen to trivialities before having a real conversation, and get stuck when i have to leave, i have to listen to things i dont care about, have to wait whilst others talk etc. I am not great with the protocol, i know the protocol, but where others navigate it, i stumble along, so i often miss avenues that others go through.
-9	negative	pet-peeves	People lie to take the easiest path possible. Whether that path leads to avoiding conflict, getting away with something that's wrong, or gaining something undeserved, it's all the same. They don't have the guts to go about things in an honest, albeit harder way. I think to lie to someone is showing them the utmost disrespect. And once you're lied to it's very hard to regain trust. Most people are good and aside from the occasional little white lie, are honest. If you ever meet someone who lies about little things, A LOT, more than likely this person is lying about big things also. Always trust your instincts. That's a hard habit to break and you're better off getting away from that person. I learned that the hard way.
-1	negative	pet-peeves	People on this planet are just
-7	negative	pet-peeves	People teases me everyday because I have freckles and I were glasses.They would call me names and all,but now people love me freckles and I'm glad
-2	negative	pet-peeves	Pet peeves in this area: 2 - People who tell me to be more assertive - but then get all bent out of shape when I'm assertive with THEM.
-11	negative	pet-peeves	Please I would seriously appreciate any financial help I can get. I am in a desperate situation, no light, gas, water. All utilities have been cut off. Rent due on the 1st of December. Nowhere to go to. I am totally broke nothing left in my life. Please, please someone help me out, I am not a lazy person, I use to make 5figure income when I took ill, THANK GOD  am alive today, had a brain aneurysm ,had to learn how to walk again. In the process lost my job. I am looking for a job as well. Any help will be greatly appreciated. I have nowhere else to go. This medium is my last resort. 
-3	negative	pet-peeves	Por qu no puedo ser feliz? eh? cmo es que siempre hay esa persona que te quita la felicidad && aplasta delante de usted?
-2	negative	pet-peeves	Pretty much almost everything annoys me Anywho, take care`.
-1	negative	pet-peeves	Pretty sure every human being annoys me in some way. Hahah Maybe not that intense but I'm definitely annoyed easily.
-9	negative	pet-peeves	Ranger school is almost over!! Hopefully he passes Florida phase and graduates later in January. So what's next? PCS to Fort Bragg, airborne training, deployment. We've talked about getting engaged and me moving up to Bragg with him but that won't be til he gets back from being deployed and we are together a little longer. It's all so exciting and scary all at once. But for the first time my heart and head both tell me the same thing, be patient and great things are in the future 
-2	negative	pet-peeves	Rather conservative with pet peeves, but if I had to mention one it would be hair left in a sink.
-3	negative	pet-peeves	Recently my grandmother passed away, it was reminder that life on this Earth is not forever, cherish the ones you love while you can today, because tomorrow might be too late There they will always be the same.
-4	negative	pet-peeves	Recently one of my close friends asked me out (I said no because I'm just not into her like that) and she hasn't talk to since thenshould I try starting a conversation with her? I just don't want thing to be awkward between us
-6	negative	pet-peeves	Saying they are interested, they really want to know me and its okay whatever it is cause they will still accept me then Okay when i confess the truth about what i am, they dont like anymore. See, now i know who is true and really want to be my friend. I dont see any wrong to be holy! So they want me to live normal doing sin in moral?.
-1	negative	pet-peeves	School was a torment for me. I wasn't popular - I was overweight - Wore glasses - Had acne - Enjoyed studying - Wasn't into sports - Didn't fit into any particular group - Was from the wrong side of the tracks - Came from an insane family Moral to the story? Don't bully! Treat others as you would like them to treat you - cuz ya never know when that person just might be in a position to exact revenge. It's better to "kill em with kindness" and ensure you never have to wonder
-1	negative	pet-peeves	Seeing my solider in 12 days he comes home for Christmas!!! Yayayaya!! 
-3	negative	pet-peeves	Seems like when I talk to him on the phone or face time it may actually make me miss him more  I just can't wait until I know if he can come home or not :/
-4	negative	pet-peeves	SMH  another lonely weekend night with nothing to do & nobody to do nothing with :P I thought by now I'd be use to it but yet there is still an emptiness in my chest. BLAH :P oh well maybe I'll watch a movie 
-1	negative	pet-peeves	So 3 days ago. My boyfriends house caught fire. Not the whole house though. The fire department showed up and put out the crawlspace. No actual damage was done to the house, they didn't lose anything, no one was hurt, and they are in the midst of 4-5 days FREE at a hotel. I don't understand why your complaining. Go jump in the pool and kindly shut the * up. Please. Thank you.
-6	negative	pet-peeves	So i have had this mainecoon kitten since march. His name was legion and he was already 14lbs! Well I am a sucker for cats and my mom and his previous owner decided to give him to a new family. He was taken at 6:00 pm. i have been going through a hard time and have lost a lot of frieds along the way. Legion was my best friend and when he left it felt like a hole was punched through my chest. Unfortunately i had lost a pet already this week. I am young and i don't know what to do I lost my best friend and baby. How do I feel better? 
-3	negative	pet-peeves	So i really love getting drunk on the weekends and it seems as if i can never control myself when i do. I can never reach that perfect amount of drunkness and just go straight to wasted. I always make a fool of my self, just saying things I dont mean, or want anyone to know. Also i always end up hooking up with guys who are never mature enough to let it go and leave me alone about when i do sober up!
-7	negative	pet-peeves	So, it gets annoying when people always ask me bluntly like "So, hey what is your race, your look is so different but unique" or like "You look like a Native American" im like really!!!!! & half Russian from my mom's side her parents were from Russia but she is also mixed with some native blood in her by her mom. it's very weird but that is what im half of.. my mother's maiden last name is actually pretty awesome.. 
-14	negative	pet-peeves	So I was talking to this girl I know who always lies and she told me she was pregnant, it wasn't till she had her '12 week scan' that she told me she lost it. She then sent me a photo of her 'baby' but forgot about the date, which said 2009. Point is this shows how far she was willing to go to cover her lies.
-2	negative	pet-peeves	Some kids carry on like a baby, just about every time I go to a shop there seems to be a kid screaming and yelling and I'm getting sick of it, I feel liked going up to the parent and say: "Control your child!" But it's really annoying but I know I can't do anything to the kid. Arrrr just so god dam annoying.
-4	negative	pet-peeves	Someone who can look into my eyes and see a story. Believes and connects on a strong level of one's soul. Slightest touch can set them off. Love to nuzzle me just as much as I love to nuzzle back. Understanding. Open minded. Fierce in love. Intense. Real in my thoughts and feelings. Gentle and kind. Sure.
-9	negative	pet-peeves	Sometimes I think I'm very ugly other times I think I have body dysmorphia. People have told me I'm ugly and people have told me I'm attractive. I just want to accept who I am looks wise because it's really confusing when you don't know if people are staring at you because they think you're cute or because I look hideous or fat.
-14	negative	pet-peeves	Sometimes i think that i am the only person different from rest of the world. Its hard but yes i m different. I speak my heart n i don't know how to manipulate people. I can see my marriage is failing but feeling handicapped that i cant walk away from it.  I feel like i die everyday when my husband kind of ignores me..i m a new mom n i want to b loved by my family which i m but dont know bout my husband..i married for love n its gone. I lament that why did i let go of my past relationships n y was not i so serious.. There were lovers who loved me deeply but i chose to ignore n walk away.. May b its bad karma but i ask god was why so much pain in my heart n tears everyday..
-3	negative	pet-peeves	Sometimes I want to share my life and my thoughts with friends or family members, but I don't think they really understand me. I am really sensitive and every time I try to share anything with anyone I just get criticized and I just end up feeling stupid and dumb.
-3	negative	pet-peeves	Sometimes i wish i could leave everything behind n run away 2 a peaceful place where its free frm assignments n reports hahahaha..
-6	negative	pet-peeves	Sometimes. Sometimes I'm not. Most of the time though I'm on my own, even in crowds. You know those more-whatever moments. Frustrating. Painful. Disappointing. Boring. It all depends on who knows, and could be many things, including accepted, embraced, appreciated, and even rewarding. The learning mind works wonders. It makes true company that much more rewarding. Ahhh
-7	negative	pet-peeves	So my ex of 2 years is now begging to have me back, missing me like crazy. Friend and family say i am better of without, i mean i am no angel in this on off relationship. I have dropped 2 dress sizes and hate being skinny. Everytime i speak with him i feel stressed. I dont know anymore.
-13	negative	pet-peeves	So my little cousin is 5 like my little sister and she always crys about everything! My little sister pushes  her a lil and she starts crying like if someone punch her in the face. Btw this is wat happend i was doing a girls makeover and let me tell you wat I let her pick her own colors and design that she wanted so wen i make it beautiful she dosent like it and she starts to cry to her mom!!! i just wanted to punch her in the face (BTW THIS HAPPEND TODAY!!)
-8	negative	pet-peeves	So my little sister is five years old and my cousin is the same age as her but sense she is skinnier and a little bit more prettier people like her more. But she always complain and my little sister dosent like her but they are like bff so i dont get it they fight all the time and then start playing again! I love my sister and some people ignore her to be with the pther one so my cousin takes advantage of that!!!
-3	negative	pet-peeves	Soooo tired. I work 7 days a week trying to get ends to meet and i just want a break.  at least some different people to talk to if nothing else
-2	negative	pet-peeves	So, sometimes someone can just say something thats part of a lyric.. like, someone says "too late" and instantly I am thrown into Bohemian Rhapsody. Its a sad sad life lol.. but a very lyrical one!
-5	negative	pet-peeves	So, so, so painful! It starts off with waves, but then becomes excruciating pangs of pain! My whole stomach hurts, my back is sore, my legs feel numb and tingly, and the pain only increases by the hour. I'm so glad this only lasts one day, and usually the first day of my period. Chocolate, please, please distract me and soothe me! Haha.
-6	negative	pet-peeves	So yeah I think Im borderline psycho. I have different personalities. They have names. They like different kinds of food and stuff. I dont know if I really do have multiple perosnalities or its just my excuse for my lack of ability in decision making lol.
-3	negative	pet-peeves	SWEETHEART Also I believe that because I have a disability so I'm not exactly attractive or good looking but I'm really nice and friendly to make up for the looks so people should go for my personality!
-2	negative	pet-peeves	Take a look at the mountains Romans 10: 9-13 if you want to be saved.
-4	negative	pet-peeves	Tear after tear and a bit more of pain trying to find comfort and once again failed. such a big void in my heart Im afraid to love again the hurt the confusion will you be there for me? I asked him he said yes but today i'm alone  and im telling him "you left" now here I am wishing I could overcome this pain 
-2	negative	pet-peeves	That's right! I say frick frack to washing dishes. They never freakin' end! It's a constant and I hate doing them by the end of the night. I literally get to the point I feel I will vomit dish soap. LOL Frick frack!
-15	negative	pet-peeves	The girl next door. The girl I always wanted to be. Let's call her Jance Jr. She had the prettiest aurbren hair. Her emrald eyes sparkled like the crystal clear water. Jance Jr was the girl of my dreams. What I didnt know, is that Jance Jr hated her life - and was fully prepared to end it right then. The smile she wore was fake. I didnt know this. I admired her. I loved her. I wanted her to know, that no matter what, she had a friend. 
-6	negative	pet-peeves	The only sports I ever found interesting enough to watch were show jumping and chess. Show jumping is a beautiful example of the symbiosis of man and animal which is not seen elsewhere. Chess is not seen on TV now as far as I know, but there was such a show in the 70's that I used to watch. 
-4	negative	pet-peeves	There are children and babies everywhere. I hate when they cry or smell. I'm a dog person and my dog smells better and hardly ever barks. I go to church and the moms don't shut there children up plus there is too many children in one spot.  I say "Just kill me now!".  Babies and children are brats.
-1	negative	pet-peeves	There are different types of liars: The type of lie I hate the most is "Lying by Ommission". Especially when in a relationship 
-1	negative	pet-peeves	There are disabled kids with Down syndrome and retardation in my gym class. They're very kind and super caring. I play with them all the time 
-18	negative	pet-peeves	There is a guy i know and sometimes talk to, and he wants attention so he says stuff like "My sister was just murdered omg" i believed him at first but then he said stuff like "My sister came back to life omfg" that made me think he is either mentally unstable or just wanting attention. Yesterday he said his house was bombed and his dad died. But i know he lives in a pefectly fine calm neighbor hood. It just argravtes me so much all the lying!!
-1	negative	pet-peeves	There is an alternative beauty so different to the shallow beauty everyone sees that it may be beyond full comprehension. Those who belittle this are both strange and aberrant.
-2	negative	pet-peeves	There is one lie that bothers me more than all the others.  I'm not sure who the liar behind it is.  Ignorance is probably the cause of its prevalence, but somewhere at somepoint there was a liar or group of liars behind it.  I hate this lie because of it's so commonly held and because it's used to control people.   The lie: EP wouldn't let me post my opinion as part of this storyno matter how much I modified it, so I've posted it as the first response to this story.  
-14	negative	pet-peeves	There is something I will never tolerate. Nor will I turn a blind eye. We are all souls living a human life. Some are blessed through compassion and some are blessed through experience. Intolerable madness is ruining this planet. Heartless apathetic souls that can not put themselves in the shoes of others. We all have a purpose and responsibility to our fellow man. Whether they understand or not. It's not about these bodies. It's not about what one lacks. Because we all lack something. Outwardly, it's just a trivial idea of what false truths we have distastefuly made for humanity. Because someone bares a handicap or disability, does not mean they lack a heart and drive to have dreams and full lives. My son is Autistic. He is beautiful, courageous and a blessing to anyone who meets him. He is a long sufferer, but will never show it. An example to all who shut there eyes to benevolence. We all have something. We are all disabled.

-12	negative	pet-peeves	They always say, when one door closes another door opens But what if you dont want to try the next door. What if you have tried so many doors in the past you dont want to try another in fear. Or that the doors that you do open, only lead you to misery and pain. I want out of this house of doors. But to leave this house of doors, I have to open one last door. What happens if I cant even do that?  I have friends around me, my family and even a boyfriend but even in a full room i always feel alone. I just want to be myself again. 
-8	negative	pet-peeves	They weren't given a choice to be like that and some of those adults fought for your freedom, some of them risked life and limb and a lot lost one or both, i honestly admire the ones that continue on living despite what they have lost it reminds me what it means to be human, to be human  means to endure, to survive despite the odds or loss.
-5	negative	pet-peeves	This hurts me bc I have a cousin who is only 10 years old and is disabled/ autistic(I'm sorry if they're not the same idk) but I would really help them and keep them happy.
-8	negative	pet-peeves	This is going to be short and simple. I am a mutt, like EVERYONE in America. However, I am a Black Woman. When people ask me, 'What are you?', I look at them with a very catatonic look and ask them, "If I were to answer your question, would it please you? Would you treat me differently? If I gave you a certain answer, would you treat me accordingly to whatever race I give you?' It is really offensive to ask people this question. I am a person, at the end of the dayjust like you. 
-8	negative	pet-peeves	This is no longer a concern of mine.  When you find someone who you love, respect, and are devoted to - the fear of being alone vanishes.  The fear of losing her is there for me, but she's a good woman with a loving heart.  I'm always concerned with losing those I love more because of a health issue or accident due to past experiences I've had.  Will I end up alone in the future?  I don't believe so - not now.  :-)
-2	negative	pet-peeves	This is the end This is the end
-6	negative	pet-peeves	This Mistake Is By Far The Worst I've made many mistakes throughout my life, but recently, I've made the biggest mistake I've ever made. I hurt someone I care about dearly, and I'm afraid they hate me now. I really messed up this time. by trying to protect myself from more heartache, I ended up hurting the person I care about most. I'm hoping I'll get another chance to fix it before the damage is permanent. 
-7	negative	pet-peeves	This morning at 6:30 I went to the drugstore.  I was approaching the entrance at the same time as another lady so I waited for her to go in first and followed behind her.  She was about my age and I had never seen her before in my life.   Who acts like this? Honestly?  Is it just hatred or could it be drugs or something else?
-8	negative	pet-peeves	This past year Wyoming's Dept. of Health has been harassing providers for people with mental disabilities. It is a shame what the state has been doing! It has been past time to stand up! I appreciate all the work Wyoming Parents Empowering Parents and providers have been doing to stand up to these bullies! Thank you for working to keep people who have disabilities safe.
-5	negative	pet-peeves	This weekend I got into an argument on a gaming forum. Simply put, I disagreed with what they said and made it clear. I guess (s)he didn't like what I said because they immediately became defensive and called me a bully as a result. This put me into an awkward position not only because I have an anti-bully website but I also sincerely wanted to make fun of this person. People are so quick to state that it's their opinion; assuming that it's infallible. Of course I didn't make fun of them and rerouted that energy into an article. As usual check out my website for the complete article: we.arepeople2.com/for-the-record-opinions-and-bullying/
-1	negative	pet-peeves	Title pretty much says it all. Hate that with a passion. I just do not find a tatted up girl with metal crap in her face attractive in the slightest. If that makes me close-minded, so be it.
-2	negative	pet-peeves	Today a EPer sent me a message thanking me for helping her in some way. When I had time I read her page every story question comment and found no contribution by me at all. I hate liars and the games they play.
-16	negative	pet-peeves	Today during modeling this girl was disabled but she was trying out to be one of the top 30 models. She had a lot of self confidence. When she got on stage it blew my mind of how amazing she did. The judges are very cruel when it comes to picking the top people. When they were calling the names of who won she was one of them. Honestly she did more better then most of us did and I'm not just saying that. Even tho I didn't make the top 30 (they were over a hundred people there) she did. I was so happy for her tho. Se was amazing and she acted like shes done it forever! She acted like a professinal! She proved to many of us today that just because your disabled doesn't mean you can't do stuff like this they can do anything! It has made me really think about life a differnt way after seeing her model today! Never ever judge someone just because they are disable!!!!!
-1	negative	pet-peeves	Today I did a persuasive speech about bullying and I don't think no one in my class understood how bad bullying is
-17	negative	pet-peeves	Today I rebelled against my parents for the first time in my life. I have realized that their overprotection is a bit too much for a 27 year old. They are very nice people and have always supported me the best way they can but I have not been able to do the things I wanted to because they think it's wrong or not required. I have never been on dates( Sneaked out a few times though), I have never gone on trips with friends or seen places. This morning I just asked them if I can stay with a female friend for 2 days as our school is ending and we won't see each other after that. And Oh BOY they went berserk. Gosh I am 27 and I can't stay with my friend ????I am really frustrated. I told them I am gonna do it no matter what they say and from now on nothing can stop me. I am a human too and it's not that I am doing some terrible stuff. I always got the best grades in school and did what they wanted. But it's my life and I am taking the control back from them.
-3	negative	pet-peeves	Today I will address "make"I don't like to hear others speak of "making" someone else do or be this or that. It has very bossy sound that is very off putting. Let us try the word "inspire" shall we. 
-1	negative	pet-peeves	Today, my friend started to txt me but I didn't answer and keep calling and calling and calling me. That stuff just get on my nerves
-5	negative	pet-peeves	Today my grandmother accused me of being a liar saying I was "kissing a girl with my hood on" when I was in the bathroom and the worse part is I didn't have a hood on I had a thermal on
-1	negative	pet-peeves	Today's peeve is the disrespect shown to a loaf of bread.Please do not put my baggies of apples, oranges, and bananas on top of my bread. I'm mindful enough to place my loaves at the end of my purchases in order for them to be the last packed. What is it that causes you to then grab it up first and smoosh it with my other groceries? Help me understand this, please. 
-2	negative	pet-peeves	To prove my point when someone's really just harassing me with the tailgating, sometimes I just brake. *snickers*
-3	negative	pet-peeves	Trying to let go of the hurt my future SIL has caused me. Things are civil now, but just looking at her still makes me sick to my stomach. How can I let go of the hurt and tolerate being around her at family gatherings? It's so hard at Christmas time.  With all this said, I think the probability of another big blowup happening soon is relatively small. Nothing huge (only passive aggressive) has happened since her wedding. I really want to let go and be happy for her and welcome this baby into the world, but I still feel so terribly hurt by everything that has happened. I can't stand knowing that she doesn't like me for no reason. I've never been in a situation like this before.
-3	negative	pet-peeves	Very happy that my school has a great special education program and the kids are really not made fun of at all. It's considered a "loser" thing to do if you make fun of or mock a child with severe autism or Down syndrome in my school. One of the few winning qualities about the people I'm with every day.
-7	negative	pet-peeves	Wanting to have a relationship but knowing it's a bad idea. I'm at a place right now where I am trying to heal. I do not want a 'White Knight' to save me. If I ever get into a relationship it would have to be because I trust that person a lot and they have accepted me for me. I was asked out recently but I said no. I feel bad about it but I just didn't like him the same way he liked me. I'm just not ready for a relationship but at the same time I feel very, very lonely.
-2	negative	pet-peeves	Was small for my age and am identical twin. Because of this I was bullied a lot, hated it.
-4	negative	pet-peeves	We all deserve to be happy. Don't let anyone take your happiness. No one can take your pain. I don't know any of you but I'm here for all of you because everyone needs someone to care.
-5	negative	pet-peeves	We don't use the dishwasher because there's only two of us, so not many dishes, pots, and eating utensils go in the sink like in big families. Nonetheless it is time consuming. And I don't have cleaning gloves, yuck! I hate it when junk floats in the water I soaked the dishes in. It's like the suspended load of a stream or river. And the bristles of the scrubber sometimes flick the food particles around. How do some people conclude that I like doing this?
-3	negative	pet-peeves	Well here I am, single again for the second time. I didn't even have an official breakup, but it seems to me that he has left me for his ex girlfriend because he is talking to her but has ignored all of my messages and hasn't said a single word to me for like 6 weeks.
-4	negative	pet-peeves	Well, I like this guy at my school. He sits behind my friend who sits to the right of me, and we talk a little bit.;
-12	negative	pet-peeves	well i moved away 1 month ago and my bf is in Germany and I'm here in England he had the idea of a long distant relationship and i love him. so we started off good but then he never had time and was never there for meand this new guy came and he was always there for me and he confessed yesterday which made me rly happy and i don't know if i should break it of with my bf.but i think of him the whole time just i am not happy.
-14	negative	pet-peeves	Well loneliness.. I am lonely and i feel lonely quite often.. But I like it, I love it! Do you know why? Maybe because it gives me time to be honest with my own self.. You can't be yourself within society, you cover yourself with shield and fight for your goal.. It can be anything: make friends, give a good expression about yourself, show yourself as a good person, cover your flaws, don't do anything that goes against the rule of society and many many others.. But you are only true yourself when you are alone drowning in your own thoughts with no goal with no one around That's why I always say I love to be myself. It's just because i love the time being spent with my own self without any distraction in thoughts. And Experience Project is the notepad for my thoughts that flows in when I am alone and true to myself..
-4	negative	pet-peeves	Well, thank God I've never witnessed this first hand, but I have seen results. Take a look at some of our homeless, and you'll see what I mean.
-1	negative	pet-peeves	& we will float like angels together.
-3	negative	pet-peeves	What annoys me the most is when someone squeezes the toothpaste tube like it been in a fight or leaves it open/uncovered. 
-8	negative	pet-peeves	What determines success? Is it intelligence? Is it popularity? No, its not. Like it or not, a disabled person is just as capable as you. If you believe you can, you probably can. There's nothing holding them back, and you certainly shouldn't try.  I would also like to point out that there is no physical or mental disability that can hold someone back from having a decent life. However, those who would put others down so they can raise themselves back up, are destined to be failures they're entire lives. 
-5	negative	pet-peeves	What if your bully tells you that he bullied you to try to stop his feelings towards you ? What if your bully actually loves you ? What if you used to love your bully ? What would you do ? Would you forgive the person ? I'm lost.
-3	negative	pet-peeves	When alone or need someone to talk to. Does it seem like the equivalent of neck deep in water and thirsty
-1	negative	pet-peeves	When I get angry or upset I can always lift twice as much weight as normal, I get these dark thoughts of dif. Things ( don't want to go into detail) I am a psychic and I can feel spirits clearer, I always wanted to know what it's like to kill someone and feel the knife sink into someone's body, I can't control my thoughts or anger an have punched a couple holes in my wall
-2	negative	pet-peeves	When I'm speaking to someone, she constantly clicks her nails on the table to add to her story, and more then half the time, I stop listening, because she is driving me crazy.
-1	negative	pet-peeves	when i never got any response nor explanation. so we are done 
-2	negative	pet-peeves	When I told my husband I was pregnant in May 2012, with his child no doubt, he proceeded to cry and tell at me as if it was all my fault He did not want another child. The fear of what might happen if I stood up for what I wanted paralyzed meJuly 5 2013 we aborted. Since then nothing has been the same, every second of every day is filled with resentment, hate and sorrow.
-1	negative	pet-peeves	When I was about 10 years old, I lived in Germany with my dad and brother. My father had PTSD and went crazy. Left us alone for long periods of time. I ate out of trash cans. (Bagel shops have the best) have any of you ever been truly hungry?
-4	negative	pet-peeves	When I was a boy my father use to call me lots of names, when he wasn't beating me with his slipper. One name was the most hurtful, and that name was "RETARDED"
-12	negative	pet-peeves	When I was in elementary school there was a special needs class attached to the grounds. It had two kids in wheelchairs, one child on crutches for life, and several that had different mental/learning disabilities. One day I came across a child that had taken the little girls crutch from her and was playing keep away with it.It still makes me mad enough to want to get physically involved when I see someone hassling anyone with a disability, especially a kid. I think that any one that gives someone disabled a hard time should have the crap kicked out of them repeatedly. 
-4	negative	pet-peeves	When I was younger I was overweight. Just a little. My entire family is a little on the heavy side. That was in February and ever since then I have been struggling with eating. My friends opinions are important to me. They never intended for me to hear that, but I did. I didn't get them in trouble because I was embarrassed. I've lost ten pounds. I'm currently 12, 113 lbs, and 5'2". Maybe 5'3". Whenever I'm hungry it makes me feel happy and in control. I don't like eating because I feel like a pig no matter how little I eat. I absolutely HATE eating in public. It makes me scared when I'm not hungry. 
-6	negative	pet-peeves	When I was young, my grandmother had a friend who was very close to our family.  He was, I found out later, a college teacher and my aunt was one of his students at some point. He may not be family (in the literal sense), but I miss him very much.  And I hope that, if he were here, he would be proud of me.
-4	negative	pet-peeves	When people ask what it's like to be lonely, I can really only describe it as missing someone you've never met and a place you've never been.
-4	negative	pet-peeves	When she/he: selfish..this is the most annoying attitude. BUT, for me, everyone have this personality. Even I am. Please get rid of this habit. Cause life is beautiful when we can serve people sincerely without asking back.
-13	negative	pet-peeves	When someone has been rejected so many times it can take a toll on you mentallyif you reject me, it does not affect me because someone else will care for me,  however if you suffer with years of rejections you have too figure out a way too leave the negative.  If you decide too ask a woman or man out and they say nolearn too move on.    If he or she TRULY wants you.you will not be rejected.   It is amazing how rejection can really control someones lifewith me you won't be rejected because there will be better communication, i will know what you want from me, you will know what i want from you (which is not very much).    If i say something too youyou will be secure enough too know i am not rejecting you i simply do not agree with what you are saying sometimes.     With me you will know the difference between rejection and simply not agreeing.     I know how too make you secure.
-7	negative	pet-peeves	When you are in a relationship the person that you are with should bring out nothing but the best in you right? While she does bring out the best in me she brings out the worst in me too. I can't help but feeling like i might be happier with someone else but at this point i have no idea how i could possibly tell her that. I feel stuck in this relationship which is perfectly fine when she is bringing out the best in me its the happiest i ever am but when she brings out the worst in me its cataclysmic. I don't know how to figure all of this out and i REALLY have no clue who to talk to about any of this. I just want to be happy.
-1	negative	pet-peeves	Where there are no walmarts
-10	negative	pet-peeves	Whether I am alone, with friends, or at school I always feel that someone somewhere is watching me and judging me at whatever I am doing. Whenever I try and do something I want to, I always think that people are laughing at me or thinking how stupid I am. In school I can barely show my face because I am so scared that people will laugh because I am so uncomfortable with myself.
-3	negative	pet-peeves	While I have a cocktail of disabilities myself, most of them related to ADHD or on the autistic scale, my twin sister is physically crippled. She's quadroplegic, legally blind, unable to speak, eplieptic, narcoleptic, and half a dozen other things I can never keep track of. I love my sister dearly, and anyone who crosses her has to go through me first.  Comment if you can identify or have a similar situation.
-1	negative	pet-peeves	Who has a soldier doing basic training in Ft Sill O.K.?
-1	negative	pet-peeves	Who hasn't ? Perfection shouldn't even be considered a word .
-9	negative	pet-peeves	Who here had to quit some friendships? I did. The guy that was my 'best friend' had some serious narcissistic charactaristics. He would only talk about himself, all the time. He was super direct and rude. Everything he did was in order to be superior then others. He was always super awkward in social groups and that made me tired. I don't know why I put up with him for so long. But I could not take it anymore. If you deny yourself in a friendship, you never truly connect with someone.  Making new friends is pretty hard, especially if you have to start over again later in life. I wish 10 years ago I knew what good friends are really about, then I would have picked some other people to build relationships with
-3	negative	pet-peeves	Why can't everyone be like Europeans are? Everyone I know from Europe eats all of their food with a fork, even French fries. Don't pick food up with your fingers.  The worst part when I see someone eating Cheetos and they lick their fingers afterwards
-4	negative	pet-peeves	Why do lies so easily spill out ones mouth like vomit?!!  Why forgive?  Why love? Why even care?  I'm no way perfect, but it's obvious that I attract deceitful, harmful and careless people.  I trust what's being told me when the truth was never an option to say.  However, yet another lesson for me to learn.  Not sure what's to come from this?  Don't trust?  Don't care?  Stop believing that this world & I was made with love.  That to want to inspire others, believe in their strength that God blessed them with, put others needs before my wants will only open the door for hurt and deceit?   
-1	negative	pet-peeves	Why do people when stopping  in traffic do not pull up behind the car in front of them? They leave anywhere from 1 car length to 3 or 4 car lengths distance between them.   Less cars get through the light, less cars get to the turn lane and makes for bigger backups.
-4	negative	pet-peeves	Why do you hate humans? I do not understand. Sure we have our bad things, we're greedy selfish bastards, but who cares? You should instead look at what the humans really are. Intelligent animals capable of the most complex emotions and mental capabilities.So answer me one question: What makes the actions that humans and other animals take that only makes the humans despicable scum? (or whatever humans are called nowadays)
-3	negative	pet-peeves	Why do you think they're mean? All meanies need help.
-3	negative	pet-peeves	Why is it so hard now a days to speak the truth you said something before, it's now  out in the open it's like you got amnesia I dislike people like that
-6	negative	pet-peeves	why people act the way they do? that is really good question, I believe there are 2 kinds of people. One kind - people scared of big world and second group - people scared of themselves That is how I see people around me. But remember, we are all humans, nobody is perfect
-3	negative	pet-peeves	Will the thoughts ever go away? The flashbacks will they ever float away? Will the scars ever fade? Did I deserve this? 
-1	negative	pet-peeves	yep I just cant be around them of a while.  when I feel hurt.  there are some that have been shut out forever and other that when they want to know how to get back in . 
-3	negative	pet-peeves	Yes, I had the same song stuck in my head for 3 years. My mom loved the long too so she didn't mind, but after a while she started asking me if there was something wrong with me. lol
-4	negative	pet-peeves	Yess I do but who doesn't and if you want you can get to no both sides of me (;
-5	negative	pet-peeves	Yesterday, I was matched with a very cute girl whose profile caught my attention :D After what I've been going through these last few weeks, I pray this is a sign that my luck is turning around for the better.

-5	negative	pet-peeves	you can say I'm an animal lover, but there are just some that really freaks me out..  hmm.. maybe i should have made it shorter =(
-3	negative	pet-peeves	You told me to be social and make friends You know I don't know how and I'm so scared.. How do I talk to people.. You wanted me to talk to boys.. You're my therapist.. You're supposed to help me! To teach me how! :'(
-5	negative	pet-peeves	You want to help them but you can't because they don't understand that they need help,they are in their world,and there they want to stay. And sometimes they creat problems to other people,because of their attitude.
-4	negative	pet-peeves	You would think if one of your best friends has recently just attempted suicide and is currently lying completely paralysed fighting for her life you would think differently about life. But recently I haven't. My thoughts are just getting worse and worse. I always promised Lauren if she ever left me I would follow her, now that I find myself in the situation I feel like I'm breaking her promise.
-4	negative	ptsd	After my husband divorced me,back in 2005, I couldn't watch TV shows or movies that had to do with marriage, divorces, couples fighting, or even weddings. I still look away when I see people kissing on TV.. though I feel sad when I see couples walking hand in hand out in public. 
-8	negative	ptsd	A great love? It's when you shed tears and still you care for her, it's when she ignores you and still you long for her, it's when she begins to love another and yet you still smile and say, I'm happy for you
-9	negative	ptsd	All my friends and classmates have this direction to walk into and their lives are taking the shape they want it to, and I am still at the same point I was when I got out of school. I feel like a failure in life and I fear I will end up doing nothing. It scares me more than death. I have this talent and I dont know what to do with it. I have tried making things happen and something always happens and all my efforts go to waste. If you have some suggestions please do share them. Thank you.
-1	negative	ptsd	A lot of things I should've done in regards to having a career vs. a job.  Oh well, can only keep pushing on.
-7	negative	ptsd	A month ago, I had a really bad falling-out with a close female friend/crush that came out of nowhere.  We were really close, and I helped her out so much (especially when she went to the hospital in October)I don't know why she would hurt me this badly. It's been a month and I'm still struggling to get over her. I've been trying to concentrate on other hobbies. But recently, with returning to classes at university & my job, I've been suffering bouts of anxiety and depression due to lingering memories with her these places remind me.
-9	negative	ptsd	Anger is an emotion, we learn from an early age how to handle emotions. We build a response that works for us at that young age. Violence worked well in the playground, so bullies were kept at bay or became bullies themselves but as people age, they grow out of their childhood things and are expected to become adults. It is much better to deal with the anger responses at source with new learnings so there will never been a time when your anger danger comes out to play. 
-3	negative	ptsd	Any word i say, any word that comes out of my mouth might exasperate him. I always have to watch my mouth. And when i do that he beats me and yells my mom for that. He accuses her for me being wrong. I just wanna leave the house but i cant because i am under age and me and my mother need his money for living and i cant talk to anyone because i dont know how they would react. I am hurt inside. I just feel awful.
-1	negative	ptsd	As much as I am sick of it, I haven't found someone worth tring things out with here, can't wait to start my career and hopefully move to a different state
-3	negative	ptsd	At age 24. The most I can say about him is that he was a sociopath. 
-5	negative	ptsd	At first I just used scratching and rubber bands to keep down my stress from bullying but then when the idea of burning came into my head it wouldn't leave. It's the farthest I have gone and will go since I do not want to deal with blood. The only downside to it I think is that I don't see as much noticeable scarring as when i used to make deep scratches with plastic knives. I've only been doing it since March I believe, but I don't do it very often. I only self-harm when I'm in my deepest fits of depression and stress.
-12	negative	ptsd	At one point I was convinced it did. I thought I had all the right weapons and all the strength I needed. I thought I had done all the work, cried the tears, felt the fears. My therapist told me this would not be a lifelong battle. Then how come I come back to the same point every time I feel I am ready to pick up my life? The symptoms spike, the sleep pattern gets disrupted, the depression comes back and I turn to being my old ogre self.
-22	negative	ptsd	Back a while ago I was in a serious car wreck. It was just my friend driving and I was along for the ride. He decided to go into the country to see how fast he could go. We went faster and faster yet he did not care. Once we took air it was over. The joy had ended and fear was in my eyes. When the car touched down we went towards a tree and he jerked the wheel and the car went into a ditch and started to roll. It rolled on its side for almost half a mile. The whole time I thought I was going to die. My head bashed the window and my arm went out and got rolled on. I woke in the hospital a day later and the world was different. I saw things clear for the first time. I saw that who I thought was my friend really wasn't. He did not care that he had almost killed me nor did he care that it was all his fault. I still to this day have nightmares about that wreck that seem so real it's as if I am living it all over again. This is my story.
-6	negative	ptsd	Basically, I'm 23, had to return home from college and I'm trapped by circumstances just out of my reach. I'm all for being accountable and making your own fortunes but I really am stuck. My anxiety is through the roof and I find myself to be scared of everything. I have panic attacks just by hearing my own family in the house. When I'm in public, I keep myself contained and put on a good show but that ends the moment I'm around my house. I've been home for two years now and each day is a struggle just to get out of bed and get my life together for one day. I didn't used to be like this. When I started college, I was shy but carefree. I had no troubles and couldn't even imagine anything like this would be happening to me. This isn't the way life is supposed to go. I don't know if I can do another year of this; something's got to give.
-8	negative	ptsd	because every time I see that I lost both my legs, I start to panic about why I lost them. Depending on what type of car it is, I panic every time I get into a sedan and when I see an SUV at an intersection I go into panic mode. I shut my eyes and breath deeply and tell whomever is driving to let me know when the SUV has passed. 
-10	negative	ptsd	been smoking for a while actually. my sister was a terrible influence but i have to say smoking weed is probably the best thing she has ever showed me. its one of the biggest stress reliefs i have and i love love getting high. it helps me with my art a bunch too. and it helped me figure out who my friends are. 
-8	negative	ptsd	Between 2004 and 2008 I was in the middle of the biggest ghost possession that I have ever heard of .   I beat my head with my fist  to keep them away I was electrocuted, thrown to the ground, followed, taunted, held down and tortured.   I am now a shell of a person.  Every day after work,  I walk several miles to keep in good health.    I cannot mentally allow myself to get help for a thyroid condition so I walk overheated and shakey the whole way.  I also am afraid to use sunscreen so my skin is not in good shape.  I can only walk down the right side of the street and  stop  and pray several times on my walkeven in a liberal college town , people look at me like I'm crazy.   I could go on and on.    Good luck to anyone suffering from ptsd. 
-7	negative	ptsd	Between my childhood, the army, and my marraige, I've had people try to kill me who were supposed to care. Some should have loved me. But no one does and I have PTSD as punishment. No one believes be, and others say I'm in the wrong for reporting the females in the army.  I want to be free of this burdon, but there is no solution outside accepting my fate and admitting that it's my own fault.
-9	negative	ptsd	but I am crazy about someone with PTSD. He is in the National Guard and it was triggered in his first deployment when he got shot. He told me within a couple of weeks about his disorder and since my uncle has it from his days in 'Nam I really thought that it would be no big deal to me.  Am I really wrong in making these "excuses" for him? Or is this distance normal? This has happened before, and while it has gotten "easier" to deal with I am really not comfortable with the situation. Is there any advise that you guys can offer me?
-1	negative	ptsd	Desparate to find a group of spouses dealing with Complex PTSD partners.  Haven't found one with search bar.  Help?
-7	negative	ptsd	Did you know there is a classification of individual called the Highly Sensitive Person or HSP?  I didn't until the past couple of years when I stumbled upon the online quiz and took it.  My score was over 90%oh yeah, there's no doubt!  Now, what was it? Having a peaceful and quiet home is important to me; with HSP and PTSD it's imperative!  You can look for my story on PTSD if you're interested.
-2	negative	ptsd	Droid phones Can make me go crazy
-7	negative	ptsd	Fatal car accident three years ago that claimed the lives of 2 great people. I have not gotten over it and only by the grace and mercy of God I will get better and be able to live without a burden that has been burning inside me. I question why I survived all the time and I wish i would of taken their places. It hurts daily.
-2	negative	ptsd	Firstly, I would like to say thatmy family is stable and I have had no traumatic events in my life. 
-10	negative	ptsd	For a few years, I lived off unemployment.  I couldn't, for the life of me, find a job after losing mine in 2009. Now I have 2 part-time jobs.  One as a cashier at Party City, the other as a Fan Photographer at Best Buy Theater.  These jobs are very part-time and I'm constantly looking for full time work.  These 2 jobs aren't good enough for my mother.  She is always saying "I wish you can get a full time job!".  When she says that, I find myself turning to her and saying "Don't you think I want the same thing?"  I tend to raise my voice, but don't mean to.  She says it all the time.  Sometimes I want to lie to her to shut her up, but that's not in me, especially with my mother.
-4	negative	ptsd	For those who have in a family someone with PTSD is helpful this program, especially if sufferer refuses to go to a therapist. I was thinking that here are many people in my situation and this program would be helpful. 
-5	negative	ptsd	Have you ever been in love with someone who makes you feel whole. Someone who makes you feel like you are number one all the time. I met and fell in love with a wonderful woman just like that. For over a decade we shared our lives together in love with each other until a few months ago she died trgically in a car accident. My life since then has never been the same. Now i have lost my sister. I am hurting more that anyone will ever know.
-3	negative	ptsd	Hello everyone, I am new to this site and is hoping that there are some good people on here that isn't going to pass judgement on me. I am a 34 year old single mom who is unemployed and looking for work. I am feeling a little down because I can not afford to get my daughter who will be 13 years old August 23rd and starting 8th grade on August 26th the things she need. If someone is out please send me a personal message and I will give you more information about my situation. 
-1	negative	ptsd	Hello Everyone! I started a closed group for those who wish to create another network of support with others also suffering from PTSD! It is open to any form of PTSD. Hope to hear from you soon! 
-9	negative	ptsd	Hello there, I have been currently homeless for a period of 4 months and counting. It's a little sad in my mind I have been looking on the bright side of my situation. I graduated from college with a degree and worked full-time. I had it all; my apartment, my studio, my awesome grades and my health. I was a teaching assistant and a librarian through the school. I was very happy or in better terms comfortable. I had money coming in and putting art out that was well received. But then I graduated, honorary degree and all. But that meant the college jobs had ended, and real life begun.  
-6	negative	ptsd	he was depressed and killed himself when i was only almost 3 years old. i dont remember him much. actually if it wasnt for the only picture i have of him holding me i wouldnt even remember what he looked like :/  i miss him. 3
-8	negative	ptsd	He was my heart. I loved him so much. He was like a son to me. Over 9 years he was with me, then just like that he's gone. I have no choice other than to accept it, because it is what it is, but it's not ok at all. Like that line from that one movie goes, you can't live without your heart 
-3	negative	ptsd	Hi everyone I am new here and thought I would share my story. The officer and my husband at times has also told me that the times when they "rage" and try to drive us away is because deep down they feel like they are horrible people for what they have done, and they don't deserve us or to be happy, so they try to push us away to "protect" us. Screwey huh!!!
-11	negative	ptsd	Hi everyone i just found out i have polyfragmented DID. I truly believe i have one if the worst cases. I most definetly have thousands of parts. And a hanful of personality clusters most i do not really think i know. It is very confusing living like this. I have a part of me for literally every task i have to accomplish a day. That includes walking writing everything just everything. I also never know who i am. I always feel disconected from people even ones i know and am constantly switching when i see a person or even an animal. So it is quite literally impossible to form relationships with anyone atm. I am 17 yrs old. Trama started 12-16. I also have little to  no feelings or emotions for my old life nor any of my friends. Basicaly my question is that is anyone else going throughthe same thing? DID is one thing but because i have so many parts i cant really get to know my other personality clusters. I feel very lonely with this at times. A response would be greatly appreciated 
-5	negative	ptsd	Hi!How are you? Are you interested in making money clicking on ads, making some surveys and tasks? If you are i will teach you the right way to do it  Best Regards
-19	negative	ptsd	Hi I have cptsd and had my last session in therapy yesterday. My therapist could tell that I wasn't too well and asked if I was taking my meds so I told her I had stopped them 2 wks ago I hate taking meds but now I can see why I need them a while longer. I am irritated,  my head feels like it's not mine, I'm extremely jumpy and anxious. I am dissasociating lots and know that I am so close to crashing into crisis I am so down and feel desperate and yet my doc says there are no appointment to get my meds until next week as I have to have blood pressure etc checked b4 I can get some. I'm worried about where my thoughts are and what I could do (to myself) and don't really know what to do other than vent. I haven't made firm descissions on what I want to do yet however my emotions senses and thoughts are in overdrive so I am ( at the moment)  aware aware of what I am thinking. I can't sleep and haven't for 3 days due to nightmares. I am scared :-) 
-2	negative	ptsd	Hi im angie my husband past away on may7th of this year im behind on rent 2 months im in need of help can anyone help me
-5	negative	ptsd	Hi, this goes out to all those that are suffering from panic, fear and agoraphobia, I know some days can feel pretty low but hang in there, there is life after panic attacks. I suffered through occasional panic attacks that later spiraled into a crippling 4 year battle with agoraphobia and constant anxiety but through patience and determination, i got through it and so can you! 
-7	negative	ptsd	Honestly I'm praying I don't wake up . I can't deal with this nightmares and I can't deal with the reality that also makes nightmares. Everything makes me want to scream and run and keep running and never come back. I even feel abandoned on here because no one talks to me like before.  I am alone so what is the point of me staying.
-1	negative	ptsd	how do I change my ways instead of sinking back into my depressing thoughts.
-5	negative	ptsd	How do you take that step and forgive someone that abused you when you were a child? My father verbally assaulted, berated, and belittled me until I was in my 20's. I have grown to be a fearful, self-centered, and depressed man. I feel I was cheated out of forgiveness from him and a removal of all this anger and hate that I have harbored for years. How do you let go of all that venom and start living again?
-1	negative	ptsd	How long will it take for a deep cut on my wrist to turn white?? Or even gone..?
-23	negative	ptsd	Hung out with a guy today other than my MM, first time in 8 months since I spent any alone time with another man. He was very nice and seems to have a lot of qualities I look for in someone to date, but all I can think about now is my MM who's company I love the most, who I'm sure is happily home tonight with his wife and child..  Feeling torn.  Who knows if I will even see todays guy again, I seem to be a one date wonder, but this was the first one in years that had any prospects for a relationship of my own.  Just feeling torn torn torn. Ug!  Maybe the reality of meeting someone I really like right now is just scary, what if I just met the guy I've waited for my whole life and here I am not excited about it because I love someone else.  Someone I have no desire to have any more from than the relationship we have. Maybe I just need time to get excited about todays guy, or maybe he'll never call.  I guess I kinda hope he calls.
-1	negative	ptsd	I almost lost her .  - I've lost a lot of things to situations I could not control
-2	negative	ptsd	I always ask for people to leave me alone even though I don't mean it. I'm starting to miss all of my old friends I think I pushed them all away. I just need someone to make me feel alive again. I just talk to a lot of boys to make me feel wanted even though I know there focus is on one thing
-4	negative	ptsd	I always have had depression and anxiety. It takes a majority of my life experiences. I was just recently diagnosed with PTSD and I want to be able to talk to people and help myself overcome my struggle. growing up without your parents and feeling like a burden your whole life isnt fun. I hate how i have the nightmares even though i have been taking medication.The nightmares are so vivid. and The ones that are memories cause me to wake up screaming.. I hate it
-5	negative	ptsd	I am 14 and am diagnosed with complex ptsd severe depression adhd extreme anxiety inssomnia and extreme anger issues i also cut and have attempted suicide i am seeking therapy now but it is only kindof helping let me know if any one cares what happened to me or is around my age with the same issues
-5	negative	ptsd	I am 23 straight out of college and lost my first real world salaried job after 3 months. The thing is i have never been happier. I do have a business that i have been working on for over a year that is about to launch, but knowing im practically unhirable has never been so refreshing. All I have is my biz and I love it
-1	negative	ptsd	I am 30 yrs old, have a good job, own my house and car but yet still single - I'm wondering if something is wrong with me.  :/.  *open to advice*
-1	negative	ptsd	I am awesome at making things difficult for myself or maybe I'm still pretty naive. I trust the wrong people.actually I trust. I should not. Trust is wasted in this time I think. Though I can not say if trust was ever valued throughout the history of man. Good Luck.
-4	negative	ptsd	i am far from it  but l always encounter people who seriously think they are perfect in every way, like they have no flaws when i can perfectly see them. lt is soo annoying how disillusioned these people are. They need to wake up and look through other people's eyes because they treat me and others like crap because they think they deserve more or better due to their mental block of seeing themselves as perfection. I loathe how shallow and stuck up all these people act, trying to act all superior all the time. i wish these people would just vanish forever!
-2	negative	ptsd	I am feeling worthless.  I became unemployed over a year and a half ago after being a teacher for two years.  I then received a pre-k teacher position at a small organization.  I was shocked when I received a call around Christmas time saying that my services are not needed for better and I feel like I'm an alcoholic.  I crave alcohol everyday and I can't stop until I am drunk.  I feel bad for my son because every morning my son crawls in bed with me and says, "get up mommy. come on mommy wake up". but I don't want to get out of bed I don't want to do anything during the day.  I don't have any health insurance to talk to a doctor.  I just want to feel better and be reassured that my life is going to turn out for the better.  
-5	negative	ptsd	I am going through therapy.  I attend group meetings and whoa lets talk about severe flashbacks happening. I am almost afraid of spending time alone with myself. I need constant distractions to keep my thoughts occupied. Now even that is not working. Poof .just like that. No advance warning without explanation my head is playing a full movie of an event I am not even sure if I lived. It's me but was it an actual event or just my mind playing tricks on me. I don't know and I don't really want to know. I am ok with not paying attention to those unknown issues. I have no problem with denial in this case. I am hopeful I can move onyet seems like moving on means going way back first and if I hid it in a deep dark place. Maybe it just needs to stay there. 
-5	negative	ptsd	I am not having a good day at all today. My mind is racing from bad thought to worse thoughts of the past, and all I seem to be able to do is pace franticly.  I dont want it to seem like Im just bitching and complaining, I just need to get some of this crap out before I totally explode. Probably woupd have helped a lot if I would have gotten more than an hours sleep last night too. 
-1	negative	ptsd	I am not perfect That s all from me..
-1	negative	ptsd	I am not sure if sharing this will help with my grief but I am hoping if everyone else is able to find some solace from this, so will I. 
-6	negative	ptsd	I am now a lot more cautious about who I go out with or if I go to places with many people, I have less faith in the future of humanity and  the planet. When I was younger I worked to party, I knew much much more than I do now, socialised whenever I got the chance, was a lot more hopeful for the world and the future but I was very depressed. Nowadays i work more, I have a lot less hope for the world and humanity, mainly keep to myself, only mix with certain people and am happier.
-6	negative	ptsd	I am so jumpy. Loud noises ( especially men's voices) set me on edge. I read up on the symptoms and I have some but not all of them. I am uninsured and can't really get help at the moment. I am still married to my husband and he's trying to improve. But even when he's yelling (happily) at the football game I just want run and hide. 
-5	negative	ptsd	I am the girlfriend of a wonderful Marine. He just got sent to Japan, and boy, am I hurting. It's really difficult talking to him with the huge change of time. Also, I can't talk to anyone around me because they haven't gone through this long distant of a relationship let alone a military realtionship. It's a real struggle. I'm in college, only 19 years old. I'd love to hear stories, or just get some support or someone to talk to! 
-18	negative	ptsd	I am unemployed and have been for over 12 years now, due to being mentally ill, though I am much better now, I still take meds, I have many skills and I volunteer but I Cant get a job, due to having no good work record for the past 12 years and before that, since I was 22. I am now 56, I would like to set up a business but do not have any capital, I would like to work in hotel reception but I do not know the new type of switchboards they use and must pay to learn, which I dont have the money for.  Other than that I could get a reception job if I had a good work record. But the youth coming into the country from Europe are taking the jobs, I live in the UK. At 56 who will take a chance on me? no one. I am bored stiff so I study with the OU and I have learned web design and do charity websites, but I have no way of earning money. 
-6	negative	ptsd	i cant be online for long..  my real family doesnt want me as their daughter.. im alone. again..  my pimp got really mad.. he beatend up my friends.. my baby's..  so yea i went back to him.. he let them go..  im just here on the streets again. taking some drugs.. doing men..  got my christmass meal yesterday :P they were giving away free food at the train station.. so i got some soup and bread ^^ first time i had food in over 5 days..   i miss u guys..  
-1	negative	ptsd	I cant find a chat room for ptsd and Im about to go off the chain . there r no ptsd chat rooms WTF, I need ta talk to some 1.
-3	negative	ptsd	I can't write coherent sentences so hopefully this will give the idea: i don't know what is going on and what to do, but i am scared out of my mind. even worse, meds do nothing for me, i am between treatment providers, and the staff downstairs tonight is not regular staff but someone filling in. there's no one to go to, no help to get and i can't even relax here because i keep heairng everything in his apartment. i am totally freaking and the only thing i can think to do is take a bottle of pills to just calm it all down!!!!!
-5	negative	ptsd	I contracted post-traumatic-stress-disorder after a particularly violent year in Rio de Janeiro. I was there to stay with my aunt-in-law's mother who was dying. I didn't quite know how long my brother would need me around. Those of you with PSTD, my prayers go out to you. This is simply a test of our Lord- you can and will make it through with the love of your friends and family. God bless.
-1	negative	ptsd	I didn't know there is a name for people like me. In fact, for a long time I thought there was just something wrong with me. Then about three years ago, after some intense google searching trying to diagnose myself with some kind of mental disorder I came across the expression Introvert. Ok so that explains why I can't make new friends or hold down a job for more than a week. Sometimes I can't even go to the grocery store without getting a minor panic attack. To me, introversion is a curse. I don't want to be this way, but I can't change. I've just had to learn how to adapt my life around it.
-12	negative	ptsd	I do love my mom. She has Huntington's disease. It is really hard to be patient and listen to her talk. She was wry mean when I was younger and didn't fully know how to raise me correctly. I have a hard time being close to her because she barely knows me. Now that she lives with my grandma( who is kicking her out and lied and said she tried killing herself), she has acted different and less mean.. Since the divorce when I was going into sixth grade. She doesn't do much for her hygiene because of her disease. It is hard to hug her and she has random outbursts of irritation but way less than when I was a kid. I sometimes really can't stand being on the phone with her even though she isn't horrible to talk to. I try to have quick convos and I worry I am a both for it. I am so scared of all of my siblings and I getting the disease.. Any of is is what I mean. I act like her when I'm mad and I cry at night sometimes because I am so scared.
-16	negative	ptsd	I don't feel like I fit in anymore!! They're all talking at the table. Whenever I try to talk, I get pushed aside. And if I don't speak, then I just sit there in silence because no one will talk to me. :/ I have recently gotten step sisters, a step brother, and a step dad. But I understand that I can't have memories like they did because I wasn't there. But what bothers me is when my mom even does it too. She won't even notice I'm there. I swear I could walk right out the door and they wouldn't even notice!! I've never felt so out of place before. I mean I have in the past, but not like this:/
-5	negative	ptsd	I don't love my mother I never did like living with her, and I had a troubling home life growing up. I'll start off with that my mother was a single mother bringing up two children, I was the oldest. Does she care? I don't know My mother kicked me down to many times for me to believe whether she is sympathetic or not. But I made it clear I'll never want anything to do with her again.
-8	negative	ptsd	I dont really know where my home is anymore. People say it's where your dearest ones live but thas not true. I moved around quite a lot and this si the 5th town in the 3rd country. I alwaus used to think that my home was where I grew up and spend most of the time but now I really dont know. I miss the place so much it makes me cry sometimes but returning back there makes me feel like an intruder. I feel like I'll never be able to have a home. All this adventure and moving from place to place can be fun but if you have no home to return to then what's the point???
-1	negative	ptsd	I feel dead, broken, tired, exhausted and the list goes on.  Waaaaa 
-2	negative	ptsd	I feel like I'm a big disappointment becuz I never did anything or said anything the way I should have.:- 
-4	negative	ptsd	I feel like the worst type of dark side, is not being a worshiper of Satan, or someone who feels they can murder without regret, buy someone who knows they have a dark side, but doesn't know what it is they're capable of. That is me.
-2	negative	ptsd	I feel really lost at this point and I don't really know how to pick up and move on. I am trying to find another therapist and hope to find one that will help me, but feel discouraged. I feel like my problem will never go away. I know, I know that everyone feels this way when they are the end of their ropes it's just that I don't see real solutions..
-1	negative	ptsd	I feel the same way, ya know sometimes I think to myself that I was born in a wrong family and get treated as some shyt 
-10	negative	ptsd	if i ever watch too much tv or netflix(as of recently), i hear voices of the people i was just hearing. not saying any exact lines from whatever they were from, just them, talking. i find myself listening to them more than i think to myself. when i do catch myself listening i think, "i wonder if this makes me crazy" just tuning into something that isn't real. i'm diagnosed schizoaffective, which is like schizophrenia and bipolar disorder combines, but is that an excuse? i feel stuck.  i'm loving my life right now, but i HATE myself.
-4	negative	ptsd	I filed chapter 7 BK and was discharged over 2 years ago. About 2 weeks ago I was informed by a former employer that I had a pension plan I was unaware of. Since I was unaware of it at the time of the BK I did not disclose it. How much trouble am I in?
-9	negative	ptsd	I found this poem before Buddy passed away and it helped me so much before and after his death. I searched for hours on the internet hoping to find something that would take the pain away as much as possible and this one was the closest. I hope it helps you. Please post any poems here that have helped you out - I'm sure we could all benefit from them
-3	negative	ptsd	If you suffer from PTSD or any form of depression, Ayahuasca can cure you. I have written my Ayahuasca story out on this site. You can read it in my stories. I talk about my childhood abuse, experience with depression and miraculous recovery.
-8	negative	ptsd	I give without receiving. I love without keeping. Every breath I take lacks meaning. My smile can be deceiving. I fake it till I make it, but there is no end, there is always another bend. I find myself wishing I was dead. I hate myself to my core, I want something to soothe my sores. 
-8	negative	ptsd	I got PTSD from having to watch my boyfriend get stabbed and then bleed to death. At first it was just nightmares, making me scared to sleep which then led to depression. But I'm one of those people who are bubbly and doesn't want any attention, so I ignored all the signs even though I had warnings from my doctors. A year later, after I couldn't ignore but depression, I couldn't ignore the anxiety, I couldn't ignore the nightmares and flash backs and I snapped. I broke down and had a massive anxiety attack, it was so bad that I couldn't breathe and had to go to hospital. I still put up my fake personality, the one that makes people think I'm happy and carefree but honestly most of the time I think I'm dying. I got professional help and that helped to some extent but I still struggle so much. I just need someone to talk to, who knows what I'm going through. Help me please? Before I break to the point where I can't be fixed.
-2	negative	ptsd	I guess this one doesn't really "count", as it was a hospital death. Anyways, my grandma had some sort of disease affecting her lungs and she was in a medical ventilator. My family decided to pull the plug, which makes sense as she was pretty much brain dead at the time, and the doctors couldn't do anything to "save" her. So I guess I didn't really watch someone die, I just saw air flow out of a mechanically respirating corpse.
-2	negative	ptsd	I hate myself soooo much.  And my stupid body thinks it good enough but I know in the back of my mind it's really not.
-3	negative	ptsd	I hate that cptsd cannot be officially diagnosed yet but soon it should be in the book the shrinks use to diagnose people. My therapist said he couldn't officially diagnose me but when it is available as a diagnosis he will change my current one. I'm a victim of childhood emotional and physical abuse at the hands of my mother and father. I experience flash backs of emotions that are so overwhelming it's all I can do to keep myself in one piece. I'm also a self injurer. I use it to try to get rid of the emotional pain. I wish the general public knew more about cptsd.
-2	negative	ptsd	I hate when people are like ok just come talk to me when you have a problem  And you're Likeyeah that's why I don't tell anyone
-9	negative	ptsd	I have 3 American Staffordshire Terriers and I love them to pieces.  They are the most sweetest, loving and amazing pets I've ever had. My oldest is 13 years old and has been by my side since he was one, my other 2 are 4 year old sisters that I got when they were puppies.  My dogs have given me some amazing memories that I will cherish for a lifetime. 
-7	negative	ptsd	I have attempted it all. I've taken diet pills, strict diets, trainers, and starving myself. I have only ever gotten one to ever work for me. With the pills, diets, and trainers I've only gotten so far with it before the weight would just stop. No matter what I would try after that I would just start gaining, despite the amount of working out would do for me. So I started to starve myself when I was working two jobs and it worked great. I didn't even notice it happening and next thing you know I'm down to 140 pounds. I felt like I was myself for once. I need a starving buddy! I can't do it by myself. 
-9	negative	ptsd	I have been dealing with my depression for a very long time. It became crippling after I came home from overseas. I just couldn't associate properly with family members. It was as if they were trying to push me out of the family. There were a lot of fights. I show love and respect for my parents but I don't feel it. I try to associate better with my siblings but it's been a long hard road. I can't count the number of times I've left home and my wife just dumbfounded by my actions. Recently I joined a veterans organization because I think I can be of help. But once all of the introductions are finished I'm happier to set alone and be the wall flower. So that's my story for now. 
-2	negative	ptsd	I have been estranged from my parents and sister for almost 15 years. The holidays are very hard. On top of loneliness, I have overwhelming feelings of shame and embarrassment (especially with co-workers, potential friends and prospective partners) surrounding this issue. How do you explain your estrangement to people in your life?
-1	negative	ptsd	I have been suffering with PTDS,Anxiety, 
-7	negative	ptsd	I have been taking care of a sick daughter for 22 years. I have also been the only one in the marriage that worked. My daughter just keeps having more and more problems, medically and they have done horrible things, I mean horrible things to her. She will always need these brain surgeries from time to time, we never know when and I get freaked out. I had a mental breakdown a few years ago and got better, but she had a bad summer and now I am back in the darkness. I can't live like this. I love her so much but don't know how to see her anymore as it is painful. I live with so much anxiety that it is just painful. I feel so alone and don't believe anyone can understand what this like.
-6	negative	ptsd	I have been told time and time again that I cannot work through all of my issues alone. the fact behind that is, trying to battle it alone has gotten me into the hole im currently in today. Today has been a hard day, I have spent most of the time wanting to scream and trying to using breathing to calm myself, but I always fail. my next appointment is Monday, where they will adjust my meds and walk me though a new way of handling every day stress. I just want to make it through the weekend and get to Monday.
-5	negative	ptsd	I have been with to my husband for 13 years. He has PTSD from a trauma suffered during childhood and had only (finally) sought help for his issues last summer. The birth of our son is what finally made him take the steps to getting better. I always thought he had PTSD but since he refused help it was only a guess.  I have rambled on a bit but I hope to connect with toher women feeling the same. 
-12	negative	ptsd	I have gotten diagnosed with PTSD back in the summer of 2012, so last year. I have been bullied all my life due to being different and I also have been bullied to a point where it's been causing me to have nightmares ALL OF THE TIME! When I got diagnosed I felt like my heart kind of sank and my parents both said: "That explains EVERYTHING now!" So they were relieved that we had the proper diagnoses for me. How I cope with the nightmares: I keep it in a dream journal or I write a short story about them and keep them on my computer. It helps a lot.
-2	negative	ptsd	I have had a few therapists suggest that I may have PTSD due to symptoms I experience. I would agree with that, except for the fact that I have no memory of any obvious, severe trauma. I was hit by a car as a child and had other "mildly" traumatic incidents in life, but nothing that feels like a reasonable explanation for my symptoms.  Just wondering if anyone else had a similar experience.
-17	negative	ptsd	I have had PTSD for over 30 years. I did not know that was what I had until I moved out of Canada to the US, and a Doctor who deals with such recognized what was going on , and got me help. Two years in therapy for it, and I was doing so much better. Then a freaking ef5 tornado ran me over.. yup.. you read that right. That was in May of 2011. I thought I had all the tools to work through it, having been in therapy for 2 years. I finally gave in, and went back into therapy. We are now giving EEP therapy a try. It is improving my sleep, and less anxiety over all. www.eeginfo.com for anyone wanting to read up on it.  Update I am now sleeping 8 hours a night every night. This Eeg therapy is really working. Yay n Chit!!!!!!
-19	negative	ptsd	I have known my boyfriend for about 6 years now. We liked each other from day one, but just recently we officially became boyfriend/girlfriend. Since then I have been seeing more and more signs of PTSD. Not surprising since we have been spending more time together. So I decided to talk to him about it. He confessed that he knows he has PTSD and that he tried to hide it from me because he was afraid I would leave him. I have always told him that I will be here for him no matter what and that I want to spend the rest of my life with him. He told me that he is getting discouraged because all the medications that he has tried so far have not worked. I want to help him, so I was wondering what medications have worked for others with PTSD? Things have been worse these past 2 weeks, 3 of his friends were killed in Afghanistan and he feels he should have been there to protect them.
-6	negative	ptsd	I have lost a very close friend, someone online, don't say anything ok. But she was such a good friend I love her so much, she stabbed herself in the lung and died in hospital. I believe although she's biologically dead a soul as beautiful as hers isn't going anywhere just yet.  Love you ellie R.I.P
-9	negative	ptsd	I have made more mistakes than I care to remember. And most of you won't even think they are mistakes , just me being a normal exploring teen. But the way I was raised, what I did was bad.  I know mistakes help you grow and become a better person as long as you learn from them, the problem is I don't always learn. Especially when it comes to the internet. There are just too many temptations and I can't keep pushing against it I am not a bad person or anything and I don't want people to think I have no control, but I have hormones :P Like any other young person. This doesn't mean I am gonna sleep around and get pregnant, but ti does lead to some uncomfortable situations *sigh*   I really wish it was easier not to make mistakes cause at some point you just give up and go with it.  
-3	negative	ptsd	I have one regret, that is that I had to quit Archery because of my physical health issues.
-2	negative	ptsd	I have PTSD and Anxiety due a two year long drama filled with violence and abuse, and not having a safe place, and no help for the one family member that lives here, and of course no money. I did start to write out the full story of what happened to me 2008-2010 yesterday, but it's still painful to go over now, even 3 years later.
-7	negative	ptsd	I have PTSD and Ashamed to call myself a vet before Iraq i used to love to hunt and use a firearm. Now when I hear fireworks i am skiddish and reserved and need to be isolated. I think it would have been better for me to DIE in the battlefield rather then a person who is hypervigilant and scared of fireworks I am still alive but my manhood never left Iraq. 
-3	negative	ptsd	I have PTSD. It doesn't control me anymore. It may wake me up rudely at night several times a week. But not as severely as once before.  I have had some horrific experiences. Seen unspeakable things. But for the most part it has made me stronger. When I first came home I was an absolute mess. I used a massive amount of alcohol to drown my feelings. Not successful. Took me 3 Yeats to start talking about it. Not telling the stories. But talking about the feelings. The fears.  The stories will stay with me.
-1	negative	ptsd	I have severe ptsd and lately my depression is getting worse. I just lay in my bed for hours everyday and stare at the walls. I recently had to leave my work because I was attacked at work and it triggered my already severe ptsd. Now I can barely get myself out of my bedroom to do anything. I dont do anything around the house and I dont do anything with my kids. I cant seem to get myself out of it. I dont know what to do. 
-2	negative	ptsd	I honestly don't think I have anything more to live for. Does anyone have any tips on how to get the courage to do it?
-3	negative	ptsd	I just started mood stabilizers and Zoloft. I know it's supposed to take some time for these to take effect, but I felt really good for the past two days. Almost back to my normal self, pre-outbursts and memory return. I have been miserable with anxiety all day and I can't sleep. Anyone have experience with meds like these?
-15	negative	ptsd	I just wanted to share the story of why I think I have PTSD. Two years ago I was running at my local high school track with one of my good friends and his family. It was dark by the time I left but I only had maybe 3 blocks to walk to get home, so I gave my girlfriend a call. I was only about 30 seconds from my apartment chatting away on the phone when I felt someone punch my in the back of the head. I quickly turn around to see someone in a black skeleton mask, all black clothes and black gloves. This person kept punching me until I was on the ground and when I decided to fight back another person in the same clothing ran up and kicked me in the ribs. They kept beating me until I screamed for help, at which point they ran away, it was in the paper the next day but I don't think the police ever charged anyone. I was wondering if any of you have PTSD because of a similar one time occurrence? 
-7	negative	ptsd	I keep having the similar dream for the past 15 years. i am in my childhood home which i call the house of horror b/c of the physical and mental abuse i suffered. i am an adult but i am seeing myself as a child and cant wait to grow up and leave. i am unable to run in my dream or walk fast. a lot of people say it's because i can't move forward. The dreams doesn't cause any distress but it's reoccurring. 
-7	negative	ptsd	I knew for one week before my baby was taken from me. I woke up Saturday morning at 5am soaked in blood and I knew what had happened. There was no need to try to tell me it's something else. I knew. My baby was gone. I miss my baby being safe inside me and wish my baby would come back to me. It's not fair and I don't understand why I would get the chance to be a mother just for it to be taken away so quickly. 
-2	negative	ptsd	I lost my best friend, lover, soul mate. two and a half years ago. and my life has never been the same. She was beautiful, perfect in my eyes, and special in my heart. I miss her everyday. im so lost without her. she was the greatest most fearless leader I will ever have the pleasure of knowing
-19	negative	ptsd	I lost my brother, by best friend to suicide 8 weeks ago today. The pain has been overwhelming. Not one day goes by without tears flowing from my eyes. Before his death, he hugged me three times and told me that he loved me very much. I knew what he was thinking about because we were that close. He attempted suicide last year, but I found him and called 911 immediately and he survived. This time, I wasn't there for him, I moved out of town. My brother was suffering from severe pain, with a broken back and his diabetes was out of control. He was facing amputation and blindness. His note said that he was tired and his body was tired.
-2	negative	ptsd	I lost my daughter Eloise Madison on October 7th 2013. She was almost 2 months old. We lost her to SIDS. I cannot understand why God had to take her.
-1	negative	ptsd	I lost my Mom June 15, 2013. She was 66 and it was her 35th wedding anniversary with my Dad.  I don't know how to do it without her.
-7	negative	ptsd	I love being happy  I find myself smiling all the time even though I'm depressed I just think of it a se greatest thing ever. It a stranger during one of my darker times who told me to "always bring your own sunshine" and I never really grasped the meaning until a while back now I live by it  helps keep a smile on my face.
-4	negative	ptsd	I love feeling confident health wise. I love to look at my self a see muscles and tan skin. I love being attractive and hate to look unattractive being ignored by other women. Looking great is key for me
-4	negative	ptsd	I love my husband dearly but sometimes i don't feel like I'm strong enough to take on his PTSD. Some days are good but when there bad there bad!! How do u other spouses cope with living with PTSD? What's your outlet? What are something's u do that help ur spouse?
-2	negative	ptsd	I'm afraid of marriage and I always believe that people change after getting married and love dies slowly.
-1	negative	ptsd	im a single 20 year old guy who has never been in a relationship but would like to possibly meet some one here on ep . Maybe thats to much  to ask but hey i  like to try 
-11	negative	ptsd	I met Belle in 1998 when as stray she wondered into my garden and flopped down in front of me. She was a very pretty long haired black and white cat with piercing green eyes. I said goodbye to her in December 2012 when one hot day I found her dying under the neighbours house. She was at least 17 years old. Belle was a cat who truly loved life. I could write for a long time of her adventures,her misadventures and her many friends over the years,both animal and humanmaybe another time. I truly miss my good friend and faithful companion. She gave to me a consistent and unwavering love over the most turmultuous years of my life. She was my rock in a very chaotic time,the one friend who was with me through it all. To be honest,she put up with a lot from me,her nurturer. Though never a lack of love,and in return showed me a devoted love herself. She was a true friend. Rest In Peace Belles, I love you.   
-1	negative	ptsd	I miss my mom. She died when I was 14. I have always wanted a mother / daughter relationship. A mom to share my joy. A mom to spoil. A sweet grandma for my boys. Love ur mom cause when she is gone it is an emptiness that always keeps u down.
-3	negative	ptsd	I'm looking to talk to some girls. Ages 16-25. Any kind of girl. It doesn't matter about what she's into.
-7	negative	ptsd	I'm not a heavy smoker by any means,  I only really smoke 5 a day at the most, unless I'm particularly anxious and/or stressed. But I'm glad I started, when I light up I just feel the stress and anxiety melt away.  It has definitely helped me get through my anxiety.   and every time I light up, it's a nice little pleasure.
-1	negative	ptsd	I'm not sure if I have PTSD and I was wondering if anyone could help me out with something Replies would be appreiated. 
-1	negative	ptsd	I'm really insecure If I see a few girls looking at me I always assume there talking bad. I'm always scared of what guys think of me. I'm insecure about my body, speech, and ears
-9	negative	ptsd	im tired of crying theres just so much going on with me my financial situation is at an all time low im so alone even though i have friends i could never tell them the way things truly are and what im truly going through. I never wanted to have to go through such agony in my life and it feels so much like i dont deserve it. Tears come  at random moments when im alone when i think about where my life is at not only do i want to help myself but also my family . My health is not the best and going to a doctor is like climbing the tallest mountain i feel like my dreams are slipping away due to constant setbacks that just keep occurring and on top of all that i left a girl who i truly do love on an immature whim . Shes engaged now and im pretty sure her love for me is now nothing more than a memory i miss her so much and sometimes the slightest thought or the wrong song sends me into a crying episode i shed so many tears and its tough to bare this life.
-14	negative	ptsd	I need someone to talk to that can maybe understand what Im going through.  If I would actually give you my story then it would take up way too much space on here to type it.  I will try to condense it.  I had a controlling and abusive dad and brother.  I then got married at 18 to the same kind of man and that lasted for 18 years because I had kids and I didnt know how to get out.  My son then decided to take over for his dad when I moved out so I had to make him go back to his dads.  Then my second husband was the worst of all of them.  When I finally almost committed suicide in May I finally got out.  I have lost of help but they arent helping enough.  They say that I have PTSD from years of abuse and that it didnt come out until I was alone because I was so controlled so much that I couldnt have any feelings of my own.  Now I cant handle these feelings.  Can someone help me? 
-1	negative	ptsd	In my darkest hour I felt lost in deep despair,  Thank you.
-1	negative	ptsd	I really hate when a scent sends me back to those moments I wish to forget. Unable to leave those moments in the past, They come from nowhere and I have no control to stop them. I just let them wash over me like the waves at the shore. The only comfort is at some point they will leave like the tide only to return again some other time. 
-8	negative	ptsd	I really need someone to talk to on here cause wellno one gets it. No one gets why I have problems trusting people or why I jump sky high when even someone opens the door. I hate living like this. I hate always have high anxiety and having dreams where I die. Because of this disorder my whole life has been turned upside down. I hate being depressed and not wanting to live anymore just because of what one person did to me when I was 7 and 11 years old. First he attacked me and then he gained my trust and fought for me and then found drugs and became a monster all over again. I'm so tired of missing him but at the same time hating him for all of the things he did to me and my family. He made me feel like I had an advocate and that I wasn't alone and then he made me feel more alone then ever. I don't know how I'll ever trust someone that much again
-7	negative	ptsd	I saw my grandfather dying right in front of me. He was in the last stages of cancer. I held his hand and a few moments later he was gone. It was strange to see him passing away. I couldn't believe he just stopped breathing. But when his skin started to grow sickly pale and cold, I knew his soul wouldn't return back to his body. It must have been a relief for him though. He couldn't walk or eat anything. The tumors had destroyed his back bones from the inside and the pain was unbearable. He was just skin and bones. It's all over now. No more pain and discomfort for him. Rest in peace grandpa. Fly free in the heavens above. I hope to see you again one day.I'll miss you.
-6	negative	ptsd	I see a lot of hokey stories on here , sounds like half of them are just people who have nothing better to do then sit around and complain, i can say that because i use to be one of those people.  Traci 
-10	negative	ptsd	I served in the gulf war in 1991.&nbsp; I have carried memories for nineteen years that are not going away.&nbsp; I witnessed all sorts of horrors over there, but the ones that haunt me are the friendly-fire incidents. We lost eight guys that should by all accounts be here today.&nbsp; Another 50 were injured that night and it wound up being the largest incident of this kind in the war.&nbsp; I don't know what makes it worse having seen it or watching the attempted cover up when it was over. Now years later it is all public knowledge.&nbsp; I am in a trauma recovery program now but no amount of reprogramming can take away the sights and sounds of that evening.&nbsp;&nbsp; The battle of 73 easting/ norfolk line&nbsp; consumes me and my every thought.&nbsp; May they rest in peace, you will not be forgotten.
-19	negative	ptsd	Isn't it funny how we can tell how a person is feeling by looking into their eyes? It's like we can tell by the squinting and the widening of the eye. Or just the dilation of the pupil can say how we are feeling when our own voices have shut us up. It almost seems like our own eyes scream louder than our own voices. Our eyes can sometimes be like our own demons and it seems like when the demon becomes stronger, that is when you have lost all control. But one thing i know that i am positive of, is when you close your eyes, that is when you know you have had enough.
-7	negative	ptsd	I spoke to a old associate of mine today and she said "I am happy things are better for you now" I thanked her, laughed, and in my head I thought "Man I must be getting real good at hiding the way I really feel"  as soon as we finished our conversation and I was alone I curled up in a ball and began to cry, sobb, scream!!!  Dont judge a book by it's cover they always say.  Truth is I am not ok, nothing has chaged, I am no longer warm blooded everything about me is cold-my heart my feelings-everything.  I have become one with my pain!!!  Even when I am laughing it hurts on the inside.
-13	negative	ptsd	I stabbed a man who I was fighting in a bar somewhere in Texas, over a woman. It was a fatal stab and I watched him die. It was about ten seconds of him moaning then five seconds of complete silence then gone. Before people realized  what had truly happened I ran to my truck and drove for a long time. This still haunts me to this day, even though it was years ago. what hurts me the most is that during the last five seconds of this mans life on earth we looked eye to eye and he whispered, I thank I shat mahself
-7	negative	ptsd	I started watching Sassy Pants the other day. I didn't expect it to be so dead on. There were so many scenes that echoed my life exactly. The lines of the mother sounded like things my own mother would say to me.  I shouldn't have watched it alone, but I did anyways. I really could go into more detail about it, I just kind of don't want to. I just started crying halfway through and didn't really stop. 
-6	negative	ptsd	I struggle every day with my PTSD. I was abused as a child and even though I'm a young adult it still lingers. I was also bullied a lot and I had a very traumatic time in highschool, I was ready to commit suicide. I find it hard to sleep, I have bad tinnitus and I often starve myself, but I don't want to go to a doctor because I feel ashamed, I feel like I should be better. I also have fibromyalgia which makes it even worse.  Does anybody else suffer? I'd love to talk to somebody else, it feels good to get it off my chest. 
-5	negative	ptsd	It has been a while since I have posted anything I guess things were good for a while but now we are back to square one again. 
-2	negative	ptsd	I think a good start in helping our beloved  is to document as much and find out the latest research made by specialists. 
-11	negative	ptsd	I think it is part depression and partly I dont know where to start. I started neglecting things, like cleaning and cooking. That turned into avoiding, even avoiding showering, moving or talking. I go through it in my head how I need to atleast try to start doing things again. But it never happens. Its like I cant find the motovation to move. I know what needs to be done and just wont make it happen. I feel stuck in this repetative cycle. Somedays ill pick things up and have a little energy, then others I dont want to deal with the world or my own thoughts. Not sure how to get out of this cycle of, being stuck, or lazy, or depressed, whatever it is, I cant get out.
-2	negative	ptsd	I think I've undergone some trauma
-6	negative	ptsd	I think since the accident he has it. He thinks about it a lot he says. He sees the incident clearly in his mind. He thought i was dead. Since then he's been sensitive. Although the accident wasn't his fault. He still feels responsible for me.
-4	negative	ptsd	I think this is me I make things complicated, I want to run away. It's not easy to love me
-1	negative	ptsd	I thought it was over. It wasn't. And now here I am a mess all over again. I just didn't expect for it to take me so long to put the pieces back together.
-3	negative	ptsd	I took a trip to Maryland to visit my in-laws for the first time. I was extremely nervous but I knew it was important for my husband that we did this.  I have to take it one day at a time. Some days I'm sad and guilty that I couldn't have a good relationship with my in-laws, but most of all I have a lot of anger. Anger with them but anger with myself that I couldn't stand up for me and I let them be so awful to me. I am thankful that I have my family and of course, my wonderful husband who has stood by my side and gave up his family for our relationship. (He no longer speaks to them) Please feel free to comment if bullying is why you have PTSD. 
-19	negative	ptsd	I took back all of those pieces that other people had taken from me.   Some of them had been gone so long that I didn't  even recognize them myself.  But I took them back anyway. As I put them back,  I carefully looked at each one and decided that each experience,  although bad,  had shaped me into the woman I am today.   Surprisingly none of the pieces cut me.  The sharp edges had become blunt over time.   I put them all back together and the whole person was there in front of me.   I looked for flaws and saw only beauty.  I looked for weakness and saw only strength.  The true reflection that looked back at me was a strong woman who has been through a lot.   But I'm not battered. . I'm beautiful.   I'm not damaged I'm desirable. None of those bad experiences define me They shaped me into this wonderfully unique person that I am.   I am all that I am. 
-5	negative	ptsd	It's another year, another year closer to the grave. Why do we spend our lives doing things we really don't want to do? No one wants to go to work, but unless you are independently wealthy it's a necessity. After this goal is accomplished I'll make a new one on my quest for living my life and actually having some enjoyment from it. I'm not ready to get my only satisfaction from my professional endeavors.
-2	negative	ptsd	It's a struggle. My wife and I have a one year old son but I have a five year old daughter from my first marriage, and she has a ten year old son from a previous relationship.  Getting all the kids together for a complete family experience is rarer than we wish and the wife and I are always fighting over how we treat each other's children. Any suggestions on how to successfully do this.
-2	negative	ptsd	Its been 7 weeks and 4 days since my mother passed away . My name is Merna Karam i am 20 years old , and my life will never be the same .
-2	negative	ptsd	It's been an ongoing on/off nightmare for as long as I've lived, but as of late, my situation has become even worse. 
-3	negative	ptsd	It's kinda weird when you stumble upon a post about child psychology and realise that the issue still hasn't been dealt with, and is still affecting you over 15 years later This is a bit rushed (and it's 5am) but I guess I need to vent. This perspective has changed my priorities a bit
-1	negative	ptsd	It's sad to watch someone you love become everything you don't need. It hurts when you're lied toand then they leave without even an explanationthey just go away. I always give my all and get nothing back. Live and learn, I guess.
-1	negative	ptsd	It started out with my soul mate spouse being killed by a medical mistake in a hospital.
-5	negative	ptsd	it totally ran my life.  But after a lot of time working on it, I was able to see through the issues and get the upper hand.  I still have to take care of myself or I can become susceptible to them again, but I think I finally am over these issues for good. So it can be done. have faith in yourself.
-1	negative	ptsd	I've already shared some stories here. 
-5	negative	ptsd	I've always blamed myself for everything. Especially my brother and friends raping me for 6 years straight. And, my ex boyfriend killing himself, I already knew that was my fault because I worried him so much with my issues. These things eat at me constantly because they're my fault. I've always blamed myself.
-7	negative	ptsd	I've always considered myself to be a rational person who despite a traumatic childhood still was pretty sane. However, over the past ten years I  found myself experiencing cracks in the armour so to speak. Every month I would have a reoccurring phase/episode which I entitled"burning the world" id seek out heightened situations fueled by alcohol where I could escape loneliness, boredom, etc.  I have found as good counselor and have decreased my alcohol consumption drastically. However, I feel baffled by all of this and nervous that these "episodes" may continue, has anyone else experienced rt his sort of flair up of PTSD mid life? A Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde experience? I wss only recently was diagnosed with complex ptsd
-8	negative	ptsd	I've always struggled with money. I'm only 18 now and there's always been one thing I've returned to time and time again, making money online. I've spent some of my free time doing this and I've managed to make over $800 with it. It's pretty quick and easy if you've got a computer at home and need money then I definitely reccomend you try it. Click below for more info about it: 
-2	negative	ptsd	I've been dealing with this since May 2012. I finally started therapy on Oct 2013 and
-5	negative	ptsd	I've got PTSD because of past child abuse and from bullying.   If you understand what I'm talking about please give me your comments. I would appreciate them very much.
-8	negative	ptsd	I've had this for a couple months now and it's getting severe as it seems. I'm trying to become a doctor, I was in Afghanistan and dealt with really terrible situations. Some id rather not talk about.  It's difficult to live with. My life should be perfect. School is easy, steady income and a wonderful girlfriend. I just want this to end sometimes. Sometimes I just think 'A gun to my head and it'd be all over.' When I do I imagine my mother and girlfriend crying , that's when I get on the verge of tears. Someone please provide advice.
-4	negative	ptsd	I've made a goal to make new friends With boys My therapist told me to. Wish me luck? It's not going very well right now 
-7	negative	ptsd	I've only been newly diagnosed and my life suddenly makes sense although the complexity of PTSD scares me. My trauma is not what has been done to me rather the powerless I felt watching people I love suffer My dad died when I was 14 then my mum and brother took it pretty hard them my younger brother died also I can't explain how hard it is to watch someone die, u never forget it. I isolate myself though I can be quite sociable but never let people in, it's made me feel very alone. 
-1	negative	ptsd	I've started therapy one and a half years ago. Thanks for giving me a chance to share.
-10	negative	ptsd	I want to start by saying that I actually do not know if I am a shopaholic, but I am starting to feel that way. For me it is not even about latest fashion. I do not care about shoes, clothes or anything like that. For me it is about collecting My Little Ponies. I see ones I love and I have to figure out how to get it. I have run up my credit card, have been half truthful about it with my husband, and I feel guilty, but then I do not want to part with them. I have sold some as a promise to my hubby about it, but I am now looking at trying to buy them back, but more expensive versions I never used to be this way. I used to absolutely refuse to buy myself anything. My husband used to encourage me to buy something, used to tell me it is ok to buy myself something with the money I earn. I finally did and now I am hating myself for it, because I cannot stop myself
-6	negative	ptsd	I was 29 and a single mom of two. I prayed God would send me a man to love me and teach me to love and be loved unselfishly. In August of 2012 my prayer was answered. I know he is still with me. I can smell him, feel his comfort, and I dream about him. I cry everyday for him and miss him like crazy. He was an amazing and caring man. He was the answer to a prayer. 
-10	negative	ptsd	i was diagnosed at 16, am now 32. so i guess that means i'm as used to life with ptsd as without it. you would think it would make it a lot easier. but when it pops up, some of it just always feels so fresh.  recently i got a book on my kindle called all for anna. i didn't know what it was about other than something about a nurse and a girl that had died. it ends up being about ptsd. it was interesting because it was all about how after she got ptsd she just lost the ability to connect to other people. that's how i feel a lot of the time. that even when i think i connect, i don't because i don't even comprehend what true connection is, and that to truly connect you have to open up some of yourself and i cannot do that.
-10	negative	ptsd	I was diagnosed with PTSD about 3 years ago.  I have a great therapist and I work with him weekly to overcome my depression, anxiety and fears. I have had a long list of stressful, painful, fearful and painful experiences starting from when I was a young child and all through my adult life. I struggle with isolation, depression, anger, anxiety, nightmares, dissassociation and other symptoms. Sometimes I feel that I can't go on but my therapist has helped me to cope with my worst days and to look forward to a future where I will be happy and comfortable with my slef and my life. I hope and pray that others who cope with this disaorder can seek out support and make positive changes in their lives too. If I can help by listening, offering positive support or encouragment please turn to me.
-11	negative	ptsd	I was diagnosed with PTSD in 1999 or 2000. I got it because my ex husband beat me and was very verbally and emotionally abusive. I had sinus surgery in 1999 because of trauma he did. I have 2 dogs that help me threw my really bad times. I probably should be in counseling still but that gets so old for so many different reasons. To be honest I like to stay in my apartment with my dogs away from the world. I am disabled and do not work anymore which helps some because I can pretty much control my environment. I just wonder if I will ever get better and no longer have PTSD.
-20	negative	ptsd	I was diagnosed with PTSD in 2009 after I was shot by my ex boyfriend and then watched him kill himself. I was one of those people who believed only soldiers could get something like that. Boy was I ever wrong I have nightmares, sweats, daymares ( lol ), insomnia, anger with no cut off point. The list could really go on. I never really knew how bad it was until I started seeing my ex everywhere, everything people said were like words coming out of his mouth. I replayed that night countless times. I became another personI haven't been the same since. The person I am now is ready to battle the world if I have to. I think I'm mad all the time. I do have problems being at home alone and in places alone full of strangers. At times I feel like one of my children, needing someone to hold their hand. I constantly think and feel like someone is after me. There is not a day that goes by that I don't. I've enrolled in college, but my daily battle isn't going to let me go I don't belive.
-17	negative	ptsd	I was diagnosed with PTSD in 2010. Before that I'd been diagnosed with depression, bipolar, lots of other things. I was 23, I guess? I was all alone there. I was abused as a child.  I'm not really sure for how long or anything.  My mom tells this cute story about how I taught myself how to vomit when I was still in the crib, not old enough to walk, because I figured out that was the way to make them hold me.  Most of my memories are like flashbulbs. Except tv. I remember entire episode of television shows, but as for "real life" I remember seconds at a time and really I'm just seeing them in my mind. I know how old I am in them because of context clues.  I still feel so alone.  About 5 years ago I found a best friend.  He left me on Monday.  He doesn't want to be friends again.  I knew all of this was coming. I was scared I would regress. My shrink assured me I will not.   I just want to be understood.   
-7	negative	ptsd	I was hired for my first job ever a few months. Without any previous experience, everyone was very impressed that I landed a job at a fancy local retail store. I worked very hard and got along well with most of my co-workers.  I can admit I was nowhere close to perfect and did make mistakes, but I tried incredibly hard and was great with customers.  Sorry for such a long story! I needed to vent. This has been one of the worst fridays in quite some time. That is all 
-8	negative	ptsd	I was in a marriage where my ex was a workaholic. The guy I dated afterwards was so needy and couldn't stand up to his ex wife. He is do possessive and is a control freak. I was not to socialize unless I wanted to guarantee the night ending in a fight. All my older friends are from my marriage or have moved away. I feel very alone because the guy I was seeing still tries to control everything using the situation I've been left in.
-7	negative	ptsd	I was in a meeting at Quest Diagnostics(where I was working as a cytoprep technician at the time) and I watched one of my co-workers cry over another co-worker being let go.But not even that could have prepared me for the news that awaited me when I got home that day.My now widowed father gathered me and my siblings to tell us that Shawn had commited suicide.Talk about getting caught off-guard.
-14	negative	ptsd	I was in my mid-30's after a 4 year marriage world down the drain. My ex hubby used to be very abusive mentally and emotionally. He got me into a world of drugs as well. I got sicker and after he divorced me over a false belief that I did something against him. I had anxiety attacks in my sleep and they hurt! I felt like I was buried alive in a straightjacket. Sharp jabbing pain shot up and down my body for a good minute, then I wake up and forget where I am and feel very tired the next day. So I deal with flashbacks and trauma every day. I have this PTSD workbook I bought and started. My therapist was very happy to see that I wanted to help myself in this area.
-10	negative	ptsd	I was medically discharged from the Royal Navy in April 2011 due to a back injury. I was only 23 (I am 25 now, been nearly 2 years) at the time so I decided to enrol in university to complete the final year of my degree (I got a FdEng in the Navy). Between April and September I couldn't get anything, only 1 interview and they looked green when they saw me with a walking stick (the agency forgot to mention it to them). I am registered disabled, I thought I should add that there. In the September I started at uni and graduated this year (July 201 with a First Class Bachelors Degree (Honours) in Mechanical Engineering. Despite this, I can't seen to get a job. I have been told my agencies that I have more qualifications than they know what to do with, yet it doesn't seem to matter, people wont hire me with my back in the state its in. I have been told by companies to contact them when my back is sorted as I am getting surgery in the new year.  R
-11	negative	ptsd	I was on the street with my classmate and with hes mother. We talked about school when a car crashed in the tree and hit my classmates mother. She and the driver died too. We stoped talking and just watched the place few minutes. Aftrr that I put my hand ony classmate  and I sad "Shes gone" when my  classmate started to cry. After that my classmate changes completely and become herselfs oposite side(agressive, fighter, drug dealer , drunk ). That moment changes my life to and from that yime I live myself on my own house to save myself from the same thing.
-1	negative	ptsd	I was verbally and physically abused my fighter pilot father from the mid60's until the early 80's. I also watched him do the same to my mother (turning her to alcoholism).  Thanks
-5	negative	ptsd	I was very conflicted with myself at one point in my life. My heart believed in one thing and my mind chased another. For some reason my mind kept winning the tug of war. I began to feel numb My heart seemed to be missing in the equation. After a series of events unfolded. Then My heart began to beat again
-5	negative	ptsd	I will expand on this later but my old friend passed away while I was in the room. 2nd the nursing home where he was has either stolen or discarded certain items in less than week after the death. Make this a rule NEVER GO INTO A HOME, ask to be put down or commit suicide. 
-1	negative	ptsd	I will live debt free.  I don't want my children to ever know what it is like to live in debt, live with debt.   I will live free from all the above
-1	negative	ptsd	I would love to see myself from another point of view lol
-3	negative	ptsd	Just because I'm 17 & I'm having a hard time dealing with my illness I really do let it refuse to control my future. Even though I can't change or get rid of what I have, I know one day I will accept it. & within that one day I will manage to create an amazing future for myself.  But until then I will be counting the days. 
-3	negative	ptsd	Last week, I lost my job. This is so depressing, I can't even think, everything seems so hopeless. I feel shame which I dont understand, I feel like a failure. I have worked since I was 15 years of age and never experienced this before. Today has got to be the worst day for me, my mind wonders to whats the point of going on with this life that seems so crazy.
-5	negative	ptsd	Lately, I often wondered if that old lunatic of a former neighbor knows where I live? It hurts to remember them. Yet I try to move on and remind myself that he's not around anymore.
-3	negative	ptsd	Life is just a constant rollercoaster. I am relatively happy - it is spring, I am psyched for the Red Sox to be active again and doing well, i am not bored, i have plenty to read, puzzles to do, people to chat with, possessions I like, food I like to cook and eat, etc. I just wish it would be easier for me to find supports. I wish the whole financial situation was easier, I wish things were more stable and secure. I wish I had a social life. I wish I could find more to do with my days. I wish I could sleep better. I wish my health would stabalize. I wish I could find treatment providers who would accept me and work with me. 
-2	negative	ptsd	Living a life that is controlled by my past. Struggling with everyday life. I have no friends. My husband and kids are my life. 
-5	negative	ptsd	Many many moons ago I was the girl with brown hair in pigtails sitting in Mr. Webber's third grade homeroom class. The question of the day was 'What do you want to be when you grow up?'. Will I ever have an answer for old Mr. Webber's question of the day?
-2	negative	ptsd	'Maybe you should just try and be a little more normal for once, why can't you just stop being rational and try, just try to pretend you want to be alive' - Mum That one hurt.
-20	negative	ptsd	Me and my brother are 4 years apart, we weren't always the best of friends but I always looked up to him.  He was a great friend, always so full of lifeI'm not sure what happend. Just days after my brothers birthday he hung himself. He had a family, a job, friends, and no signs of depression. But when my brother drank it was a different story. 08/04/13 was one of those nights, he had been drinking and celebrating is birthday. He walked to the park and hung himself by a swing. I try so hard to understand what he was going through but its so hard. This will be our first holiday with out him and I'm trying to be strong, Thanksgiving just passed and it wasnt the same it was so hard to be thankful when a huge part of my life was missing, I have a million feelings but I constantly have to stay strong because I have a family of my own who needs me. I wish you were still here big bro!! 
-3	negative	ptsd	Michael had a lot of problems from the time he was little.  In kindergarten he got mad at the teacher for telling him he had to put away the blocks, well Michael kicked the teacher in the leg.  His anger was always a problem.  He got sent home that day. 
-3	negative	ptsd	Mine is to be a better me.  No more excuses, be more confident in myself and what I do. To set goals for myself and actually finish them there's so much I wanted to do, but never pushed myself to do them. This year will be the year to do so. And truly mean it.
-1	negative	ptsd	Mom passed away very quickly at home from respiratory failure, just a month ago. xoxo
-8	negative	ptsd	My best friend Ryan committed suicide 2 weeks ago yesterday. He's always been depressed  and talked about it endlessly so I can't say it was a huge shock but it still hit me pretty hard..I'd never been to a funeral or even seen a corpse before and I had to be one of the pall bearers and give his eulogy..We also worked together so it's been tough not seeing him. He was a good man who always put everyone else ahead of himselfI was sad at first..then angryat him and myself for not being able to do anythingI know he was in a lot of pain and I'm hoping now wherever he is, or isn't, he's at peace. I'll miss you Rye guy.
-6	negative	ptsd	My boyfriend has it from a motorcycle accident, our motorcycle accident. I think I might have it too but for different reasons. I keep having dreams, once in a while, about my brother that died. I'm not sure why keep having them. it's weird. most of the time I don't think about it. I I did see him die when I was five but when I'm awake I can hardly remember that. I only remember bits and pieces from my experience. Does anyone know why this is?
-5	negative	ptsd	My boyfriend of 8 years cheated on twice and I took him back. The second time he told me he will change cause he really loves me. We usually spend New Years Eve together every year but this year we both thought we would go away with friends. On NYE he sent me a message saying he doesn't want me anymore and is back with his ex and is also speaking to other girls. I feel so so betrayed and feel like I have no way out!
-4	negative	ptsd	My brother killed his self 10 years ago they say it gets easier but to be honest it doesn't, you've just got to stay strong. When you lose someone its never gonna be easy!. If you lose someone to suicide just don't blame yourself, remember them for who they were and stay strong, lead a happy life for them and yourself .
-16	negative	ptsd	My cat, Sandy, ran away two years ago. It was my fault, because I left the door open without thinking for a few minutes, and when I didn't see her I thought she was sleeping under the couch or something. She had seizures without her medication, and thinking about how she could have died from them scares me. We searched for her for over a month and couldn't find her. I pray that someone found her, got her medicine, and gave her a home. I hope she didn't end up at the shelter, where they would have automatically put her asleep (we did look there, too, but she wasn't there).  I still get tears in my eyes when I see her picture or when I think of her. I definitely have not forgotten her. She was the first cat I had.
-13	negative	ptsd	My Complex PTSD seems to effect me more at times but I've seen my husbands play out with our boys more now that our daughter has been born. He's constantly on top of them berating any "girly" choice they make. I'm just absolutely trapped inside my head at times to the point I don't hear the kids or what's going on around me. My husband had one traumatic event playout and had to live with the perpetrator for years after the fact.  My trauma is being investigated by the UN as a violation of the Treaty on Child's RIghts and Treaty against Torture for nearly 10 consecutive years. So I really can't help him or my children through this because I'm the one that needs a crutch most of the time. I wish we could afford counseling but we cannot and we don't have insurance. I'm afraid our kids will have secondary PTSD because of this and I hope that I'm wrong because we're trying to do everything right with all the wrong tools.
-10	negative	ptsd	my dad favors my sister and my step mom continually stabs me in the back I cant tell her anything about how I feel or when I need to just blow off steam she use my angered words against me and tell my severely bipolar dad who then turns his anger at me or I will get shoved into the middle of my parents war jus because I am honest. even when I am honest I get called a liar and my sister does not help because she sees it as one less opportunity to get yelled at for no reason and I mean I can only take so much I am a senior in high school without her biological mom, without friends and who has watched her friend die from leukemia in seventh grade. I just want a chance to take a breath maybe get a full night sleep instead of being scared for when the next war in the household to happen so I am different I don't like sports I like books does that mean I get treated like crap?!?!
-10	negative	ptsd	My Daughter - A Good Example Anyways, I responded to her and said, "honey, you go ahead, I've already donated my hair before".  She responded with determination, "there's nothing to say that you can't do a good deed more than once Mom!"  She had a point.  I loved her emerging compassionate side and wanted to set a good example for her.  Instead, she set a good example for me! So, I cut my hair just below my ears and donated the rest.  Then we both had the same hair cut, but her's grew out WAY faster than mine! lol
-3	negative	ptsd	My daughter died as a result of aortic stenosis and complications following a Ross procedure, aged 3yrs and 2mnths, in 2010. She would now be six and a half. I know she isn't really sending them. I don't believe in heaven. But every butterfly I see brings me so much comfort.
-4	negative	ptsd	My dog Brayden was hit by the trash man and killed. The driver of the truck didnt even have the decency to come tell us he ran over our dog or to pull him out of the highway..he just left him there for other cars to run over. A neighbor lady saw this happen.she stoppped and told us. I miss him so much.
-10	negative	ptsd	My ex husband was very emotionally and mentally abusive to me leaving me with mild PTSD. Many people do not understand this, especially when i have anxiety issues due to it. I have overcome a lot since then but still struggle with it daily, especially since i am back living in a military town. My ex husband was an active duty soldier so if i see any military i get anxious, especially if it is army. I also tend to try and please everyone else make everyone else happy around me due to him. I have tried counseling it does nothing for me accept me feel worse about myself. I do not want to go on medication especially since i am trying for a child right now, but it is becoming harder and harder to cope. Any advice would be great!
-14	negative	ptsd	My experience starts in the 90's, in the military, before the term PTSD was mainstream.  I find it so hard to deal with day to day crap.  Sometimes even minute to minute.  I find myself standing or sitting in one spot, not doing anything in particular, for long periods of time.  I have gone through many "phases".  The raging alcoholic, the functional opiate addict, the dysfunctional opiate addict, the recovering opiate addict, back to the functional opiate addict, blah, blah, blah.  Intermingled with varying degrees of depression and anxiety.        Well, by now, you get the point.  I just joined this site and these "generalities" are all I'm comfortable sharing right now.  If you see my profile pic and know what it is, talk to me.  Especially if you know first hand which, could be a wife, husband, girlfriend etc of someone struggling with this.  Whether we talk or not, I wish you well.
-1	negative	ptsd	My father died 7 years ago 
-5	negative	ptsd	my great grandmother passed away in 2005, and a couple of years later so did my great grandfather, soon afterward pennies started to show up in the oddest places, on the middle of the couch cushion, a freshly cleaned floor, in my brothers hat, even on my pillow. the pennies are always face up, and are either new or extremely shiny
-10	negative	ptsd	My heart is broken. I just want someone to come along and fix it but I know that's not how these things work. I know the only way to heal is through time. I need to be patient because that special new person will come around when the time is right. I'm just so sick of crying. Tired of the heartache and the ghosts of my memories with her. Everyday the sting is duller and I don't cry everyday anymore. But the thoughts that I should try to get her back still come. She won't come back, her life is better now. He's giving her things I never could because of my responsibilities.  I just needed to get this out. Encouraging words from people who have survived these feelings would be appreciated beyond words. &lt;3
-2	negative	ptsd	My husband died June12, 2013. He fought for five long years with Cancer. Would be nice to chat with people again.
-7	negative	ptsd	My husband has been suffering since 2005 with PTSD.  He was a detective and loved his job.  Taking a life stopped him dead in his tracks.  I am not going to lie, it's not easy but it is worth every step to make sure he knows he's loved and cared for.  I just want to share my story to give hope to other wives/husbands.  
-6	negative	ptsd	My lids feel heavy and my eyelashes clasp together hoping waiting and longing for sleep.  My body temperature rises as every muscle in my body cramps and strains against my will.  The all too familiar wave of darkness washes over me and my mind swims trying to reach the surface for air.  The fish swimming around me, gnashing their teeth, tearing my skin and clothes.  My blood coursing through my veins and spilling onto the floor while the noise of the crashing wave deafens me.  Strong arms pull me from behind and try to drag me to safety as the world is burning all around despite this huge wave.  I feel myself spiraling down and out of control as the dizzying nauseousness takes over and overwhelms my senses.  I force my eyes to open and face the terror head on- only to realize I am in the mall, not back there.  
-6	negative	ptsd	My life is a mess! My bff moved out and on, I decided to contact my mother after years of not speaking to her, I lost my dog then my other dog got depressed and stopped eating i almost lost her too. Things are going surprising well with my mother but just her presence in my life is causing issues. A flood of memories have come back but I can't block them out I can't even distance myself from them, I am afraid I am going to lose my mind! All my life everything I have thought and felt has been distanced like they were not my thoughts or feelings, I don't know why they were that what it was never something I tried to do it was just how I was but now I am feeling everything, remembering everything I can't make it stop I want it to stop!
-11	negative	ptsd	My mom and two of my siblings are borderline. None of them are willing to get help for it. And they feed off from each other on a daily basis. Unfortunately I am disabled and very dependent on them for help day to day. I try to find ways to separate myself from them (activities outside of the home) but because of my condition, I can no longer drive very often on my own so it is pointless to have my own car. My mom is very manipulative about allowing me to use hers. Things like this (as I am sure anyone here can contest) is what just adds to my daily stress of having to deal with them. The thing is they all act like they don't even seem to care that I am very sick and the way they act is making me worse. I don't know what to do. I've tried going to therapy, reading books. I think the only way I am going to get away from them is if I get into a relationship but its hard enough to date when you aren't sick
-9	negative	ptsd	My mom is in ICU and I got my heart, not broken, but shredded tonight. I was dumb enough to fall deeply for someone prematurely, yet again. I did that years ago! Sick! I knew him less than 2 months maybe, and it already felt like I was in love with him. It's all over now. He expressed what I took as no reguard to whether myself or my mom lives or dies. What if I'd actually lost my virginity to someone heartless enough to come at me at a time like this? An example that men like my exes still exist and I need to be wary of them. I don't want someone who can't be real.
-3	negative	ptsd	My mom says a lot of stuff she doesn't mean when she's drunk but I can't shake the thought that its what she really thinks, I've confronted her and she promised to stop drinking but has yet to stop
-8	negative	ptsd	My mother has borderline personality disorder and has always treated me very different from my siblings, they can do no wrong and I can do no right, I have a 10 month old daughter who my mother hasn't seen since she was 3 weeks old. I am in the process of forgiving her and accepting that she is the way she is and isn't going to change.
-2	negative	ptsd	My mother hung herself when I was five. It's not fair that it's my only memory of her.
-14	negative	ptsd	My mother was a major depressive, schizophrenic alcoholic so she was basically doomed from the start. Despite all that, she still managed to survive 37 years on this earth before she put her life to an end. I have good reason to believe she would have killed herself sooner; but she was apparently waiting for me to be old enough. It is my belief that she emerged from her delusions only to find that she is still alone and miserable; and that she consequently gave up hope of finding somewhere she belongs. Disheartened by the fact that she didn't get what she has been yearning for, she put her life to an abrupt end. That is what I believe to be the why of it all. That is my reason for her suicide.
-3	negative	ptsd	My name is Matthew, i am 37 and am a 19 year veteran of the U.S.Navy. I have PTSD from one of my deployments to the desert. I have been undergoing therapy for the last 2+ years, and last month my physchiatrist was elated when she told me my numbers were way down!! (that is a good thing)I am still experience symptoms from time to time. I know I will never be over it, but I am glad that I dont experience those feelings on a daily basis. 
-2	negative	ptsd	My pets are the reason i was able to get through my childhood.  Now i have 3 beautiful loyal Rotties, a shih tsu and a Chihuahua!
-20	negative	ptsd	my sisters, my mom and i stopped to a gas station. 2 seconds later we looked and myfriendwas in a car accident. i saw him fly through the backwindshield.!!! i ranacrossthe street in front of a 18 wheeler (ididn'tcare) and i looked him in his eyes as he coughed up blood and gasped for air.. his jaw was broke it was a painful sight.. my face was the last one he saw before he died.. maybe god was trying to tell me something. i haven't slept correctly in four days and theyhaven'tarranged his funeral yet but its sad how he died the day before valentines day he was only 14 he never had a chance to live life, he made everyone happy though always kept a smile on my face.. so sad he's gone and the visions of the accident keeps playing in my head.. i'm going to miss him forever until we meet again (i hope)..
-6	negative	ptsd	My Story   the reason I have depression is cuz I have PTSD for those who don't know what that is its Post Tramaic Stress Disordor. I got while I was im the army in Iraq back in 2004. the stuff I seen there would make your head turn. that ii have it 
-6	negative	ptsd	My ten year old little boy Aldo was put to sleep in my arms at home last week. The most heartbreaking decision I will ever have to make. I miss him so much. I can't believe that I won't be able to see him again. He was a tuxedo semi-feral cool dude who I sucessfully tamed. I was blessed to have the little fella for four and a bit years. Like other posters, his passing was unexpected and sudden. I thought that he would be with me for the next few years. I took my time with him, gave him lots of love and did all the behavioural techniques that were suggested. In return, he was the sweetest, most loving cat whose progress surpassed all expectations. Whenever I wore a new outfit he would look me up and down and then give me a blink/kiss if he approved! There will never be a cat quite like Aldo. He was definitely the cat for me and I really miss him. 
-2	negative	ptsd	My three week old daughter was sent for testing on empty oxygen tank..She died a week later too swollen for dialysis and her skin splitting and leaking.  She suffered a lot that whole week.  It was so hard to watch my protective new mother senses raging.
-5	negative	ptsd	One of the hardest things to deal with when trying to overcome panic and anxiety is knowing what to do with all that excess energy. I know when I used to get my panic attacks it sometimes felt like I just wanted to jump right out of my skin! My heart would race at a thousand beats per minute and I thought one day it just might literally shoot out of my chest. Of course my hypochondria only made it worse because I was convinced I could have a heart attack at any moment. 
-6	negative	ptsd	On march 23nd,About 1:30am my oldest dar came home and cane and me told me that carl did not look right. he Was in the liveroom laying down.

-2	negative	ptsd	"Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate.  Our presence automatically liberates others." 
-2	negative	ptsd	Parents are divorced since I was 10. I'm an only child too.  - what do you think of my life?
-5	negative	ptsd	Past is pastbut if you look at how I do things, you'll knowsometimes it's in my eyes, sometimes it's in the way I handle things.  Things have happened that I'd rather undobut what's done is done.
-4	negative	ptsd	People always assume I watch sports because I play so many. Watching sports gets so boring. I barely even watch the big event ones like Super Bowl or World Series.. I mean these events aren't an every-day/week thing so they don't get as boring, but it's still the same thing--Sitting and watching people who get paid millions of dollars to play a sport and still make stupid and annoying mistakes. No fun. Lol. 
-4	negative	ptsd	Question: Of course putting your fears in perspective is only part of the solution. A very big part, but it's still very important to know what exactly is going on in your body during a panic attack as well as learning to turn that rush of adrenaline into something enjoyable. I've created a video on my youtube channel, and it's also on my site, you may want to check it out and hopefully it helps you overcome your temporary limitations. Not sure if I can post links on this forum but its (Live-Panic-Free) followed by Dot com. Thanks for stopping by my site.
-2	negative	ptsd	Saying that I have a dark side is like saying dictionaries only define one word. Help me.
-3	negative	ptsd	She really does a lot for me. She is so nice and loves me and it's just the love for your mother is something special.
-12	negative	ptsd	Should I go to a small get-together that will involve drinking even though I don't drink with a guy friend who I used to like and was romantically rejected from in the past?  His new girlfriend and 2 other friends that i do not know will be there.  I am worried I'll get too anxious -- most likely feeling bad that I used to like this guy even though it's in the past and I am mostly over it.  I just, I want to go to meet more people but it might be anxiety provoking.  I actually am glad he had a girlfriend, that helps me get over him and I didn't want to hang out with him one and one, so I think this is a good opportunity.  But still not easy.
-2	negative	ptsd	Since about six weeks I suffer from what is seen as (adult) c-ptsd. I did reach out for professional help but in my country (as elsewhere I guess) it is not so easy to find help or treatment. I seems I am through the period of flashbacks. Still I am loaded with the pain that came from that. Quite desperate at the moment.
-5	negative	ptsd	So, I never realized how much my life relies on the internet until I no longer had it. Literally, my life IS the internet. And now. Now I have lost it T_T I won't be able to get it back until mom gets paid. Le sigh OTL
-4	negative	ptsd	So it is now day two of no contact.  I've been here before and made I through you would think that makes getting over it easy but it doesn't. Why doesn't it?
-4	negative	ptsd	Some days it's quiet, it's dormant inside me and I might forget that it's there. Most days I feel it growing, and then when it's ready it bursts inside me and I'm unable to get out of bed, pick up the phone, make myself a meal Wishing everyone, myself included, strength today and everyday
-2	negative	ptsd	Something happened to me about two years ago, nothing severe, I was never hurt or anything. Just mentally scarred, now I won't leave the house or go anywhere by myself, I don't trust anyone, no one, and i can't explain what it is like, only someone who has been through the same thing would understand 
-6	negative	ptsd	Sometimes I think I spend more of my time in flashbacks than in actual present life.  I find it so hard to stay in the present and I'm always so scared.  I no longer believe in safety- it's a nice thought, but it doesn't exist and it never did.  I have a "startle reflex" my therapist calls it, that's pretty bad.  It's the fear I find so hard to live with, the fear from the past that I can't seem to get over in the present.  I haven't known about my diagnosis for long, a few months, I was in a really good hospital trauma unit for four months, but now I'm out and feel worse and worry I'll never be able to function normally again.
-4	negative	ptsd	The feeling of heaviness on my chest like something is standing on it with all its weight. The feeling of giving up of crawling into the fetal position and just giving up. I can hear the words in my headuseless, everything is my fault, failureno one is there saying it anymore.  No one elses face is so close to mine saying those words for hours at a time.  I can breathe now but my body won't let me.  I know it will passkeep calm, breathe deeply, positive thoughtsit will pass.  Tomorrow will be a brighter day.  It will pass.
-4	negative	ptsd	The future looks bright for both Big Tobacco and people who enjoy the totally awesome pleasure of their cigarettes.  It was always thought that when these kids came of age, the first generation to have internet from the time they were born, they would be more independent, more fun-loving and more into experierncing the pleasures of life, having seen so much of the bs of society before they were 18. And, sure enough. Between 2011-2012 Sales of E-Cigarettes to 10th, 11th and 12th graders increased 100%, a record increase not just for young people but for E-Cigarettes overall.
-1	negative	ptsd	The Hardest Thing I Ever Had To Do. 
-2	negative	ptsd	The latest official release version of myself is pilotbob7.5 but 8.0 is still in beta testing.
-4	negative	ptsd	Therapy is BS. I can't forget something I am made to talk about every other week. I don't feel like I'm the mother my kids deserve on the meds. I have no rest from the constant anxiety and nightmares. There is no way I'm ever going to beat this 
-2	negative	ptsd	There are currently over 110,00 people waiting for an organ donation. The largest group waiting is from 18-49 years of age. An average of 18 people die each day while on the waiting list for an organ donation. Organs and tissues from a single non-living donor can be used to benefit more than 50 people. Living donors can donate a kidney and parts of their liver, lung, pancreas, or intestine. Living donors can be evaluated to help a friend, family member or even donate anonymously to patients on the wait list. I am overwhelmed with pride - and my miracle boy keeps on giving. 26 lives, and counting.
-4	negative	ptsd	There is a reason why your eyes are not on the back of your head; you are suppose to look forward into the future, not behind into the past.
-8	negative	ptsd	There's so much to say but I'd like to find some like minded folks first and foremost. I want desperately to save this disfunctional marriage but it's pure chaos. And I'm at my wits end. While I am getting help from meds, psyc doc, therapist, counselors, pastors and all the self help material i can mangage, my spouse refuses to seek any treatment when he's been told he desperately (I added that adjective), needs it.so again.HELLLLLLPPPP anyone???
-15	negative	ptsd	These past few months have been horrible, people all around me have been committing suicide. I never knew a single one if them but to here what they did, breaks my heart. No one is ever alone. You may think that you are but once your gone, you'll actually see who cares, but that will be too late. If your ever thinking to cut yourself or end it, think again. It might put you out of your misery, but it will hurt the people around you.  My story is true. This just shows that people are looks out for you even though they aren't  your friends. If anyone ever needs to talk, I'm always here 
-18	negative	ptsd	The weirdest and saddest thing happened to me 2 years ago. I had a blind cocker spaniel her name was Miley. I really liked her she was a good dog with a great personality. So I was getting ready to go to school my mom drove me we were backing out with the car I took a last glance to see Miley running around in the back of the garden. I started looking for my lipgloss in my bag when my mom screamed that se ran something over that something was Miley. I was startled and sad. I didn't even want to believe it. The weird thing is the only was she could get under the car is if she ducked and went under on purpose. The previous week I noticed she was depressed cause we had another dog who started to bully her but we gave her away beforehand. It's like she knew what she was doing which made it even more sad and made my whole family feel guilty. Till this day I never meet a dog like her she was smart and calm and special she will be missed forever
-2	negative	ptsd	They didn't say this outright, but my mom Know that she doesn't care, my siblings all take her side because she's the mother of course. They don't know about the things she's said to me. I'm only staying with them because my dad would not want a scandal in the family. But how much of this kind of treatment can somebody take and not get fed up? I just really want to run away, or just kill myself.
-7	negative	ptsd	They say that you often repeat what you are used to. This cage is all I know. Why is it that it seems like such a risk to leave it? The only one who is now keeping me here is myself just like a bird in a gilded cage.with the door wide open.
-1	negative	ptsd	This is one of those random things I decided to post on a whim 
-11	negative	ptsd	This morning around 2am I received an email from him. He called me sweetheart and let me know that his travel went alright (to where he will be in Afghanistan) and he said he hopes that everything is going good here for me.  I got that message and felt both a moment of happinessbut it was followed fear. I could not handle it if something DID happen to him. Andwhat happens if he comes back and just like 5 years ago after his first deploymenthe detaches from me again. its a defense with him. Buthow can I fight that.
-2	negative	ptsd	THIS PAIN this pain that none shall see.
-7	negative	ptsd	Those few words. They hit hard, like when you would get hit with a ball to the head playing dodge ball in primary school, and the worst part, they come at the time you least expect and from the ones you didn't ever think would say it. People say that they are just words, but words are more powerful then a lot of people think. I have a scar on my body for every single hurtful word anyone has ever said to me. People don't understand it; what they say can hurt. The one person you didn't think would ever turn against you seems to be the only one who does. It's as if everyone who you thought would stick by you no matter what, are always the ones who are the first to walk out. Tonight I've decided I'm done with those people. As I sit here covered in my own blood, a fresh cut for everyone who's ever hurt me. Well, thats all they will ever be to me from now on. A scar.

-12	negative	ptsd	Tuesday Nov. 13 was the worst day of my life. I let my best friend down, I feel like I killed her.  I made the appointment, I deside to go throw with it. Doctor told me it would not hurt her she would just go to sleep. As they put the shot in her.  She screamed, she was looking at ME in the eyes, I looked her in the eyes and she screamed at me. They could not get the shot in her vain. She gaged twice. I should of grabbed her and took her home. I should of tried meds anything. I know she was 19, but I should of done more. I will never forgive myself for that. I let her down. I just want her BACK. There is a big hole in my heart. 
-12	negative	ptsd	Two summers ago, my parents had gone away for three weeks for vacation. I had thrown a party with close friends. Drinking and having a good time, i soon became drinking to hide away my pain over the past couple of months.. I became hysterical when each drink was for all the hurt ive been covering up. I took bottles of all different pills and hid away in one of my bathrooms. My friends soon became upset, and confused. They didn't understand what had happen, or what i was doing. I was trying to kill myself i told them, and to leave me be. I took over 60 different pills that belonged to my mother. I didn't expect to live but waking up the next morning sick as a dog, with my friends by my side. I was confused and in a way happy they had stuck around to make sure i was okay. I was sick throwing up a lot of the next couple of days.. but my experience had changed my life i can't start to explain. 
-19	negative	ptsd	Us girls. There were five of us - Nellie, the bully; Chrissa and Freida, her sidekicks; Miranda, my friend, and me. Sometimes there was a sixth girl, Laurie. Laurie was shy, but nice. One day, a girl called Weena started waiting with us. Weena was in a class with Laurie, and they were some-what friends. Laurie was the only person Weena could count on. Of corse, Miranda and I were always nice to her. One day, Nellie made an announcment that Weena was no longer aloud to sit with us. Chrissa and Frieda followed her. Miranda and I ignored her. But what surprised me most, was that laurie spoke up, agreeing with Nellie. I couldnt imagine what Weena felt. Laurie was her trusted person. Her only real friend.  The next year, Weena changed schools. I never heard from her again. Until March. Her mother posted Weena's story in the local newspaper. Weena's story of why she committed suicide. 
-3	negative	ptsd	Victims of a sudden impact are some of the hardest to treat. It's not just the collision that injures them. It's everything after. The centrifugal force keeps them moving, tossing them from vehicles, throwing them through windshields, slamming their internal organs into the skeleton. Their bodies are injured over and over again. So there's no way to know how much damage has actually been done. Until they stop. -greys anotomy
-5	negative	ptsd	We all see someone pass - it is a natural part of life.   And, yes, it can be heart breaking.  But, if you continue not believe that their soul is within us, and out there, they will never be able to come back and bless you. Jennifer.
-7	negative	ptsd	Well I have 2 older brothers and they are awesome but I hardly talk to them anymore, not to worry though. I have always been the black sheep of the family so it's normal, if anyone has worries about if they are the black sheep of the family, I am always here if anyone needs to talk :D

-1	negative	ptsd	Well, like i said i've been in this blah mood for weeks, and just yesterday i was thinking what if i go?, what if i leave everything i know behind, what if i start a new life in some other place, new people a new life, start overbut i can't. My mom has diabetes and i would feel guilty if i leave her, but i just feel like i can't stand my life anymore, i want to leave everything, i want to drop college, i just want to run away from here, i feel so stressed everyday, and i dont think i can take it any longer. 
-1	negative	ptsd	Well someone just used the L word on me for the first time in more than two years Kinda want to run away screaming. Kinda want to say I like you too.. I don't think I'm ready to love again. I know I'm not ready. How can I love him back when I don't love myself?

-12	negative	ptsd	What the heck are therapists for? Waht ever I did think they were, I do believe I was wrong! Several years after a traumatic ordeal I finally decided to go to a therapist and try again. I was going to see if I could talk about things, if I could learn things about myself, and also I thought I would be guided toward the use of coping strategies and counseled. The second appointment, she had me figured out enough already to refer me to a dr. to start trazadone. Yes, I have problems sleeping but I don't need something for my mood. Been there, tried that, and I would like to be able to move with the up's and down's of life with grace and by taking care of myself then by taking medication. I am uneasy getting prescribed meds so soon after we started meeting. What do you all think?? Is there anyone else out there that takes this medication for sleep and anxiety?

-13	negative	ptsd	When I was 13, my best friend had died in a golf cart accident. I was devastated, and wanted to see him one last time. I took about 16-23 Advil and lied down to try to go to sleep so I wouldn't wake up. I started bawling, I went out to my mom, and told her. "Mom, I just took a bunch of pills and i'm so sorry." She called the hospital, but I refused to go in. She made me go to the bathroom to puke them up, I said I did, but I didn't. Nothing happened. I take that as a sign that God doesn't need me yet. It wasn't my time. I regret doing it. because after i started cutting really bad. i have scars up and down my arms, my inner thighs. i don't want my future husband to ask where they came from. I don't want my future kids to ask "mommy, what happened to your arms?"  Take Care 
-21	negative	ptsd	When I was twelve my older brother was sixteen. He was getting bullied in school and it was hard for him. He always came to me to cry to because I was younger. It was hard watching him go though that but I thought he would be alright. The morning of his birthday I went to his room to wake him up but before I entered I saw a note on his door it said " ok I know it's my birthday but I'm over I did suicide I'm so sorry I love you Caitlynn". I burst into tears and ran to my mom and told her. The funeral was so sad I cried the whole time. Me and my brother always used to fight but If I could go back i would have treated him better. I love him so much and I miss him.
-4	negative	ptsd	When I was younger I was overweight. Just a little. My entire family is a little on the heavy side. That was in February and ever since then I have been struggling with eating. My friends opinions are important to me. They never intended for me to hear that, but I did. I didn't get them in trouble because I was embarrassed. I've lost ten pounds. I'm currently 12, 113 lbs, and 5'2". Maybe 5'3". Whenever I'm hungry it makes me feel happy and in control. I don't like eating because I feel like a pig no matter how little I eat. I absolutely HATE eating in public. It makes me scared when I'm not hungry. 
-4	negative	ptsd	When people think of cutters most of them think we cut our wrists. This is a wrong assumption most of us have learned by now that wrists and forearms are too visible and we get made fun of or bullied because of it. We instead cut shoulders, legs and other areas that aren't visible and leave the wrist and forearm for the grand finale.  Thabk you
-3	negative	ptsd	Why can't my mom understands me. I told her that I'm busy so I won't go with them. It's so simple "I'm busy" and she can't even understand and she'll force me to go with them. I won't waste my time shopping, eating and some other random stuffs. I just wanted to finish what I'm doing. Is it too hard to ask?
-3	negative	ptsd	Will the thoughts ever go away? The flashbacks will they ever float away? Will the scars ever fade? Did I deserve this? 
-1	negative	ptsd	Yes I Believe in pennies from heaven!
-18	negative	ptsd	Yesterday was a hard day. Some days are much easier than others with being able to stay busy. I love my marine and he is in recon training right now and it's hard to talk to him because they have them training for so long and by the end of the day he just crashes. He is amazing because he calls and texts me every chance he gets but he just sounds so defeated. The good news is that I may be able to see him for valentines day weekend  I really hope this comes through because it's been about 8 months since I've seen him. All the other times that we have tried to get together it falls apart. The military comes first, I know that. Just would like to have him for a weekend.

-10	negative	regrets	31 years and  I thought we could make it through anything. Not this time. I said 3 strikes your out. But my heart is still broken. It is so much easier being stuck than changing. I am a woman that gives everything I do my very best and the 1st time he cheated we were married 21 years. I put all my feelings aside and just told myself My best friend needed me and what kind of friend would I be and nothing he can do will fix it. So why am I so hurt and sad. The marriage we had could not have gotten any worse and I know that it is better to be miserable alone than unhappy with someone. So why can't I just pick up and go on.  Someone help me , please.
-2	negative	regrets	aah i want a Sugar Daddy ive always wanted one i love older men(; so get at me!

I'm smart, never laizy - and what is waiting for me ahead?! Nothing.. Is anyone in the same situation? What to do?

-2	negative	regrets	A lot of things.. though I know i have nobody to blame but myself. 
-13	negative	regrets	Alright. I planned to do a college tour (while staying with friends and family) in NYC and Philadelpha (and surrounding areas). I arrived at Newark International Airport and took an NJ Transit train and subway to Grand Central Station. I walked into the station, and all that was on my mind was how the heck to get to the train I needed take. As I continued walking, staring all over the place, an African-American guy probably slightly older than me approached me. A minute later I found my train and calmed down a bit, but I simply couldn't believe that I could be such a(n) *insert insult* and not simply give a guy who needed some change for a train ride, I assumed. I really wish I could contact this guy and apologize. That was like the very, very worst thing I have ever done to society. I made a YouTube video about it but I don't think he'll ever find the video. I don't know how to stop thinking about this.
-5	negative	regrets	and I followed the truck on my bike trying to stay in the cloud.  lots of kids did it.  glad i did not diebut now as i age i regret that i did this because somehow it may come back to haunt me like give me some syndrome or something.
-5	negative	regrets	And I just recently I made another. I hurt someone that I really didn't want to hurt and I didn't think the consequences of my actions through before making poor decisions. Because of that, I hurt someone else and there is no way to fix it. I can be a horrible person to others at times and I am so disappointed in myself because I should really know better by now. If I haven't learned yet, when will I learn and stop hurting others. In not learning from my mistakes I am choosing to be a horrible person. That isn't what I want.
-4	negative	regrets	And in this case, my mom sure rubbed it well so that it stained every inch of me. Yeah I did, yeah I was stupid for doing that, but lord almighty that was five years ago. I've changed a lot since then. --Stella
-2	negative	regrets	And it came at a huge cost. i ask myself everyday since why i was so stupid.
-1	negative	regrets	and move on. You try fixing things and you just dig deeper and deeper into the hole until you find you cannot get out. I tell you this from experience.
-3	negative	regrets	and so I'm sitting here today trying to put them behind me and get my happiness backI just really need to move forward. I never, ever knew it would be this hard to put the past behind me. I'm so desperate for the days to come and go and be over, for time to just pass, in hopes that the heaviness will be less.
-2	negative	regrets	And the courage to change the things I can and the wisdom to know the difference. Bless The Lord everybody, got my praise on todayfeeling blessed and highly favored!!!! #happysundayyall!! 
-10	negative	regrets	At a young age I realized that I had  done things that I'm really not proud of. I mean its killing me inside I regret some things, its those you could've and you should've moment. Being a freshman open my eyes to reality, I don't know how but it just did and I realize that I've done things I'm really not proud of and I can't control what happened on the past but I could change what could happen in the present and Ill try my hardest to make smart decision and be more mature. Think of the aftermath of my decisions and actions. Well, at the end of the day those things Ive done that I wasn't proud of makes up who I am today and the following days. Its all about making right decision.
-11	negative	regrets	A while ago, I found out some very significant parts of my husband's life were not true. He lied to me about finishing school and lied about having a job. Both of these lies have put us in a bad position financially. We have been working to get through these matters and he has since turned his life completely around. Although I do have some trust issues now, I feel positively that our marriage is going in the right direction and that my husband is sincerely sorry. Recently, I spilled everything to a close friend. I feel guilty for telling my husband's secret, but I think I was just tired of holding it in for so long. I have tried to follow the general "rule" that you shouldn't speak poorly of your spouse in front of friends or family. Now, I am unsure of what to do. Did I make the wrong move telling my friend about everything?
-4	negative	regrets	Being married for 9 years and having 2 kids aged 5 and 8, takes its toll on passion. So my wife depressed for 6 moths, I met someone about a year ago. Wow, fantastic. Told wife I want a divorce, moved out of the house, had the summer of my life.   I feel sooooo lonely! 
-8	negative	regrets	Being single has it's ups and downs. Have been for a long time. Starting to wonder what I'm doing wrong? But it's ok. I know she is out there. Just wish she would show up soon. Getting tired of having alone experiences lol. 3 years single is a long time without someone. Well it could be longer Lets go all time personal record! XD
-2	negative	regrets	Better to improve myself than neglect myself or loathe myself to the point of being unwell. Life hurls unbelievable curveballs so I'll take what I can and build an amazing invention out of the debris.

-1	negative	regrets	For letting people walk over me!!!x
-1	negative	regrets	But I can't. Because I am sick and bedridden and I have no where to run to. :-(
-2	negative	regrets	but i cant change the past no matter how hard i try 
-2	negative	regrets	but i cant! so its pretty pointless to go any further with this. i've learned to accept reality.
-4	negative	regrets	But i don't regret them.. Its made me who i am today and i wouldn't change it!  "The past is the past, so leave it in the past. I live for the now"  
-1	negative	regrets	 But I've learned from them.
-2	negative	regrets	But we're no wiser than our string of years allow
-7	negative	regrets	Can someone explain to me the meaning behind being selfish in your recovery. My spouse uses that often and I feel he uses it as an excuse sometimes to get out of anything with life. He is going to NA and that's pretty much all I hear is that he has to be selfish in his recovery. I didn't really think that made you exempt from being a husband or a father and just playing your play station when you actually are home.. Can anyone clear this up for me please?
-2	negative	regrets	Can u guess what it is lol
-1	negative	regrets	Death  The keys from the dreams make me happy for sure
-1	negative	regrets	Decisions i should of thought about a long time ago
-4	negative	regrets	Did you know what you were doing when you walked into my life? You once told me that you were a monster - perhaps the only time you didn't lie.  I sacrificed myself as prey. 
-1	negative	regrets	Do I dare ask I will not be able to fly.
-9	negative	regrets	Don't believe me? Lets go through them shall we? When I was 12 I started hanging around people who smoke and do drugs. When I was 13 I handed in my V card, started self harming AND attempted to kill myself. When I was 14 I got in with what could be described as a gang. I made a lot of mistakes in there. More than I want to talk about. And now I'm fifteen. I've spent almost every weekend this year so drunk that I can't remember a thing from that night, I relapsed, I got hurt by a guy everyone told me was no good, and I've almost killed someone. I regret every mistake, especially the ones I can't fix or put back. Fifteen and I've made bad decisions. I wish I could turn back time and do things differently. 
-1	negative	regrets	Do you ever just stare at the clock waiting.  And the word "wait" becomes obsolete?
-13	negative	regrets	Do you want someone in your life to give you a second chance?  Did you make a mistake in your relationship & want to make it right?  Are you a parent who has a regret?  Are you separated in your marriage but want to give your marriage another shot?  Want a second chance for a friendship that ended?  Looking for ALL kinds of SECOND CHANCES!
-5	negative	regrets	Ever feel like you have just slipped off the last strand of whatever it was keeping you up and now you are falling? Falling into a dark pit.  This momentary regret making me realise the truth that lies within me. My decisions have all been right except for this. She should never feel pain of any sort, even when, especially when, she hides it.
-3	negative	regrets	Ever had that experience where you felt as if you needed to get to know this person but you probably never going to see them again
-3	negative	regrets	Ever regret a decision? I do. I slept with my friends wife over 8 years ago and it still haunts me. Not the gratification, the guilt of betraying a close friend. It eats me up and causes me to question my validity as a friend. They say men don't care if we do this, but it's a lie. I would say don't do it!
-14	negative	regrets	Every day I wake up, thinking of the pain i've endured. The people I once knew and my family that I left behind. Every painful strike my bullies and father gave me and wonder "why did I survive? Why couldn't I just have stayed down and died?". I used to keep myself up with thoughts that i'd runaway, far away. that me being born wasn't a mistake and that i'd experience real happiness and find love.  There's always that one person who helps us when we are at our weakest. Well, nobody was there for me. It's too late now, i'm far past the point of wanting to be saved. With these stories, at least someone can tell what I was like. They can read my first story and see how full of hope I was back then and how it all went downhill from there.
-1	negative	regrets	Every step revisited. Every word Every fault. I look I cannot see. 
-10	negative	regrets	For now, I'm a single mum to two amazing daughters, eight and six. I love them more than anything, than I ever believed possible. I love them so much. I regret not having more.six is a big age gap. But I have decided, I'm single and it's tough enough, if I find someone I truly love? Maybe. One to two more children. If we can afford it- financially and emotionally.
-1	negative	regrets	For some reason I am filled with regret about death that were not always beyond my control.  Maybe it's time for me to release my regret and this confession is a part of that process. To forgive myself for being a frail person who cannot change what was. 
-2	negative	regrets	From about the age of 14/15 I've done things I'm not proud. Repeatedly. Not always the same stupid thing or to the same person. But shameful enough I can feel myself being embarrassed and flush faced when I think about some of them.
-4	negative	regrets	F what you see from the eye doesn't  please your hen close your eyes and see from your heart because the heart can see beauty and love more than the eyes can ever wonder .
-6	negative	regrets	Giving to much can result in heartbreak and betrayal, I gave to much and got to much taken away. Presents and gifts taken by people who act liked they cared but in reality they just threw it away as if money had no value.
-3	negative	regrets	Going back in time would make it so much better . I could stop myself from doing stupid things that i have already done. I can be a little me again >.~ . But i guess man couldn't invent time machines for a good reason . Who knows what bad may occur from it o_o
-5	negative	regrets	Got a score of 28, which explains quite a lot.  My teddy bear would score much higher.  He should take the Huggable Quotient test too, if there is such a thing.   Diagnosis of anything, in my experience, has been very inconsistent and unpredictable. 
-10	negative	regrets	Got into fight with friend ive been saving him from going to jail for the last year and yet he doesnt care. The guy is using me and i believe hes stole from me. The last straw was when i told him of this app and he called me unmentionable names saying that he can find friends in real life. That was the last straw
-3	negative	regrets	Got married too young,to the wrong person and as a consequence being the loyal person that I am probably turned down women that could have maybe made me happy.Its was such a miserable,stressful time what a waste .Learnt a good lesson though if it isnt going to work,how ever painful it would be cut your losses and walk away , lifes too short.
-10	negative	regrets	Guess this is my wake up call to ending something I let go too far. I sent some pics to my "friend" while he's on a business trip thinking he would be a bit lonely for me. He said not to send anymore as he has been loaning his phone. It made me feel cheap and dirty. The way he texted the request not to send anymore The thing is he's going through a divorce and I'm the other woman. It's the yo-yo effect. He wants me then he doesn't. Ugh!!!!!!!!!
-7	negative	regrets	Happy new year - well as the first day of the new year draws to an end I can honestly say I'm one happy little lady  I spent New Year's Eve with 2 friends who always make me laugh, I got to FaceTime with my airman at midnight British time and then again at midnight Missouri time (0600 In Britain) so in a way despite the distance, we still saw the new year in together. It's now 3 mths and 4 days until I see him in person, I'm cracking down on my studying to help that time pass and all I can pray for is that this year is going to be just as good as the last half of 2013. We are getting through day by day with my love for him forever growing stronger :D
-1	negative	regrets	Hasn't everyone done something there not proud of?!
-1	negative	regrets	Have a great day everybody!
-2	negative	regrets	HAVE TO HIT A TROUGH TO FEEL A HIGH   EVEN IF THE HIGHS FOR A SECOND EVERY MOMENT IN THAT ROUGH TROUGH IS WORTH IT
-9	negative	regrets	Have you ever heard someone say - I wish I knew then what I know now ??? To know something, is to live life. if you knew everything you know now, when you wished to know it, you wouldnt remember it. Life happens - for a reason! 
-5	negative	regrets	hello i am a 43 year old male who has lived with my mother in london all this time. i dont have many friends, i am a loser with women,i have not had a Girlfriend in 7 years. i dont have a social life at all.

-1	negative	regrets	here i am admit regretting ending things with this person what do u think?
-9	negative	regrets	He was my absolute best friend in life, and I still miss him deeply   I still have moments where I need to break down and cry for him like right now as I write this.  I had him for 14 years, through my confused 20's, he was always there for me. Now his soul has moved on, and I have managed to get on with my life.  I have 2 other cats.  I love them.  But as horrible as it sounds, do not honestly love them as much as I loved my thursty.  He was made for me, and as hard as I try, I can't really get over his death.  I miss him so much   Thanks for providing an outlet for me to express my feelings
-2	negative	regrets	He was the biggest mistake of my life. He burnt my soul and then threw my heart into the fire as well. He never cared about me. He only claimed to. He lied to me. I feel so stupid.
-1	negative	regrets	Hey look things happen for a reason are paths have been set in stone before we find are selves in life be happy with what you have because one day youth not have what you always never wanted but realized you needed them all this time
-11	negative	regrets	Hi guys.. I was reading through some of the posts on here and I wanted to let you guys in on a program from home I was introduced to by a friend of mine. Its a great way to make some extra money while your unemployed or even if you are employed and have an extra hour or so a day you could do this.. The program is BBB Accredited and all it requires you to do is post ads and each person that signs up you get $25 for. I started a few weeks ago and I've been making at least $50-$200 a day, and I usually get around 2-10 people a day so far. I was a little skeptical at first but im so glad I joined now. There's no monthly membership fees like most other work from home jobs and its only $25 to sign up.. you never pay another dime and you are a member of the program and have the ability to make money for life. I made my $25 back within the first couple of hours. If you guys are interested heres the website -  or you can email me at justinamcip@gmail.com - good luck!
-9	negative	regrets	Hi, six months ago I became a member of a club I didn't want to being too, I became a widow just shy of 4 years.  We had know each other fro childhood,, and one day our paths crossed and a new adventure started.  Then  left for work that morning with the usual good bye, see u this afternoon,but when I came back he wasn't watching for me out the window.  I thought he was napping only to find him dead, I remember screaming and running for help, and now just a hole I don't now how to get out of;in less than a month the love of my life was gone, my home, and my business.  With a broken heart I would welcome someone to talk to,advice on how to move forward, and  feel like I have a right t move on with my life and find new happiness without losing what we had.  I don't  know how this works,a learning process I guess.  Thanks for listening.
-5	negative	regrets	Hi, this goes out to all those that are suffering from panic, fear and agoraphobia, I know some days can feel pretty low but hang in there, there is life after panic attacks. I suffered through occasional panic attacks that later spiraled into a crippling 4 year battle with agoraphobia and constant anxiety but through patience and determination, i got through it and so can you! 
-5	negative	regrets	How do you take that step and forgive someone that abused you when you were a child? My father verbally assaulted, berated, and belittled me until I was in my 20's. I have grown to be a fearful, self-centered, and depressed man. I feel I was cheated out of forgiveness from him and a removal of all this anger and hate that I have harbored for years. How do you let go of all that venom and start living again?
-2	negative	regrets	How many stupid mistakes I made in 17 months?! I am such a miserable oaf. Small minded miserable oaf.
-5	negative	regrets	I almost did for good but my sister followed me so I brought her back and I got caught and they made me talk to the cops on the "dangers" of running away
-1	negative	regrets	i almost od'd in febuary 2013 and I think my mom was very disappointed in me for even feeling like this. I wish I never felt this way in the first place
-1	negative	regrets	I always beat myself up about things.No more.
-1	negative	regrets	I always wish I can just pack my things move away change my name and hope for the best
-2	negative	regrets	I always wish that I said more. That I told someone how I felt. I constantly live in the what ifs. I regret not loving deeper, standing taller, and not speaking my mind.
-8	negative	regrets	i am 20 and i have made mistakes even more than the days i have lived , but i never regret them , because they made me who i am now , yeah , i am not perfect , never will be , i mean , no body is ^.^ . ACCEPTANCE  is the keyword >_&lt;
-3	negative	regrets	I am 21 and my 'boyfriend' is 30. We have what could be considered an open relationship. My parents have met him twice and really like him, but they don't know we're dating. When I graduate college in May, I'm planning on moving to another state. He is more than willing to come with me and I think that would be wonderful, but that would bring up more than a few questions. I have no problem telling my parents, but I'm not sure how to negotiate an nonawkward and drama-free move-in while keeping everyone happy. Moving to another state and living with the man I love would be amazing, but I can't help feeling like crazy dreams like that just don't come true in my life. Other crazy-awesome things happen, just not the things I plan.
-11	negative	regrets	I am a very smart and capable person.  At work I am very successful and get recognized regularlysometimes too much.  This drives me to beat myself up over such small details that my bosses wouldn't even notice.  It can get in the way of my relationships with others.  Sometimes they seem to feel that I put them down about their quality of work because I am so driven to get everything to the best level it can be.  Probably true to some degree, though I try not to do it. I find it ironic that my success depends upon my ability to treat myself as if I am one.
-4	negative	regrets	I am human. I make mistakes. And yes I have done things I'm not proud of. I've hurt people. I've kept secrets. I've lied. I am human. I make mistakes.
-4	negative	regrets	I am in college to be a teacher and my biggest fear is never being able to travel and being stuck in the town I grew up in. I recently decided I want to go to the Air Force but I need to lose a ton of weight. I am trying but I don't know if I'll be able to do it. I just want to make something of my life and go places.
-3	negative	regrets	I am introvert.  It's maybe because of that that people find me awkward.
-5	negative	regrets	I am not having a good day at all today. My mind is racing from bad thought to worse thoughts of the past, and all I seem to be able to do is pace franticly.  I dont want it to seem like Im just bitching and complaining, I just need to get some of this crap out before I totally explode. Probably woupd have helped a lot if I would have gotten more than an hours sleep last night too. 
-1	negative	regrets	I am not sure that I would change a thing.
-9	negative	regrets	I am so bloody annoyed! Was meant to be spending the whole day with my MM at the drug den. The emails between us last night were so lovely and it made me 10 times more excited to see him today.  Another job he was interested in has fallen through, so on Monday his going to an agency to look into doing contracted work again instead of permanant. He wanted to get a permanant job but seen as they're not really coming up a lot for him he's gunna look into find another contracted job for 6 months or a year or something. Fingers crossed he'll find one that's still quite far away  Im off monday, so gunna go with him to the agency which means we'll spend the whole day together again which will be lovely. So really i know missing the 3 hours today isn't a disaster but it's still a pain, i feel like every moment with him counts.
-3	negative	regrets	I am strong. I am willing. I am able. But some days are just so hard. All I can do is sit alone and cry the pain out. I keep telling myself that it will all be alright. Telling myself that I will see him soon enough, even though there is no such thing as soon enough. I'm so proud of my airman, and all I want to be is everything that he deserves. USAF love.
-8	negative	regrets	I and my 5 yo son have until tomorrow to leave. The shelter manager wanted us gone today, but the case manager convinced him to let us stay an extra day. The reason? Missing out on chores because I'm 8 weeks pregnant and have been going through extreme fatigue, nausea, and pain on top of that because of having to stop all my presc Just plain awful, and if I hadn't stayed in better shelters in the past, this would have been my last attempt at ever staying in one. But I know there's better shelters out there, this just isn't one of them. 
-2	negative	regrets	I cant decide how I want to ask my friend out on a date can someone give me some ideas?
-2	negative	regrets	I can't get you out of my head. Just wish you would call but I know you won't. It's over and besides after all the stuff you said to me and put me through, I shouldn't want you back. I never should have let you that close and will keep the past two christmas's in mind when I meet the next person.
-3	negative	regrets	I cant. I'm too young, no money, no place to run to. I just want out of here. Theres got to be a way
-3	negative	regrets	I can't stop . I have tried and I have had so many blades taken away from me, self harm controls me . It helps me stop thinking   Too much..
-2	negative	regrets	I cant stop thinking and blaming myself no matter how I tried to think that things will be better. Regrets have always been there and now I cant sleep thinking those mistakes I have done in my life. I wish I could turn the back time
-1	negative	regrets	I can't wen go outside now because my FRICKING DADS girlfriend says I can't and he just goes along with it!!! I can't go out past 8!!!!
-8	negative	regrets	I cheated. With someone who turn out to be a crazy stalker. I was unhappy in my relationship and looking for an out . Now I'm still in my same relationship and my bf is a drunk & verbally abusive but I allow it bc I feel bad for what I did to him. In some ways I think I deserve to be constantly put down for what I did.
-4	negative	regrets	I completely miss the emotional aspect my boyfriend have me but I really miss the physical too. We had so much passion. He did everything right he knew my entire body and I knew his. His touch gave me butterflies. He was so affectionate I felt so lucky with him. I feel like there's no one else like that out there for me ;(
-9	negative	regrets	I dated him for 8 months and got engaged and then married at age of 23. His business was doing fine (according to him) then and I was also earning fine. After 10 years today he blames me for bringing bad luck in his life. He gets irritate with me too oftenabusesand hits in anger as well. We have a 8 yr old kid as well. He is although a very loving father and a dotted son to his mother but for me.NO. I am earning well and running the house.What shall I do now as after so many years he thinks that I am his bad luck 
-13	negative	regrets	I did exactly this today, when I finally got hold of him. I guess he was sleeping, but I went on and on bout how he is abandoning mebecause I went 12 hours without being able to talk to him. There is more to it than thisbut to make a very long story shortI will just say that I am a complete nutjob, and I am insecure and have mommy issues and abandonment issues and trust issuesand prolly many more. I am crazy. He is still thereand he listened to my rant and still loves meeven though he hasn't called me back yet.
-5	negative	regrets	I do admit to myself that I'm not the perfect girl in the neighbour hood, I do admit that I've done things that I'm not Proud of. It's in our nature and sometimes in life your forced to do things that you don't want to do. Lift your head up high and hope for the best, anyone gets in your way, knock them down. Think bright and leave behind the dull and old you, if you want to change, it's what you do next that can change it for ever. Stick with people who you care and love and those who do the same back.
-11	negative	regrets	I do beat myself up pretty badly. And it's not pleasant. But I guess the only way to put yourself in the right place you have to do it. Growing up, I often hear some adults say that if the child won't listen to you when you're scolding him, you have to physically beat him because that's the only way they will learn. I guess that's the best way for myself. Sometimes. . . we need a  good verbal beating especially when we clearly desrve it. 
-7	negative	regrets	I do believe in this but at the same time i don't. I have a regret yes it does deal with a relationship. Being 20 i actually broke up with someone i believe i love.Even if you are older reading this i do believe young people find love. I regret it and wish i could take it back. Now that i look back at it. I just dont know why i didn't give us time to talk things out. So yes im living with this regret. Now hes in a relationship we still talk almost everyday and he says he wants to be with me. Hes the kind of person who never wants to hurt anyone so he hasn't broken it off with her. But i don't want to be the reason something that may be good for him fails. Just the thoughts running through my head. I miss him. This is a regret of mine. 
-5	negative	regrets	I do not text ppl very much not to bother them but When I do and they don't text back it kills me I have a friend which we usually talk in whatsapp, whenever she's alone sends msg and I reply back as soon I could but when I send msg she replies so late
-6	negative	regrets	I don't beat myself up per se, as much as I give myself a stern talking to.  I really don't handle defeat well. When it comes to me handling situations I'm like a hemophiliac in a razor factory.  I think I have an objective point of view of my failures, it's just that they see me first.  I'm quite certain when it's all said and done I will win in the end.  I just have to find a way to extend the curtain call.
-3	negative	regrets	I don't exactly understand why people make fun of things that nobody can change ( unless they have a lot of money ) like their nose , eyes,ears . Things that you were BORN with . You can't help but to have that / be that. You didn't choose it so why must you make fun of it?
-6	negative	regrets	I don't hate old people I just get annoyed off sometimes by the ones who are really snobby and think they are the most important It annoys me sometimes when they slag off the entire younger generation. Yes kids were better behaved back then, Yes there a lot of younger people who think they have swag about causing mischief but not all of the younger generation are like that!!
-2	negative	regrets	I don't know if I have gullible written on my head or something but I always get stuck with a friend who lies ALL THE TIME. I'm to nice I swear.
-1	negative	regrets	I don't really know if what I have been through has made me stronger, or just want to push people away more.  Either way, I'm tired. I shouldn't be this exhausted from life yet. 
-5	negative	regrets	I do this all the time. I just pack all my stuff and leave weeks at a time with no destination in mind. I by a train ticket to for which ever train is departing the soonest and go. I'm over 18 so I can legally do this. On these little escapades I do all kinds of crazy stuff. I actually went bungee jumping once. When I get back home reality hits me. I don't have anyone who cares so I just pack up after a few weeks and leave again. No boundaries. No consequences. No problems. Am I the only one that escapes my problems this way.
-6	negative	regrets	I exposed the mistress in person, but I left the cheater alone due to him being a lawyer. His profession shielded and protected him and his wife, but I did not spare his mistress. I forced Karma to visit her for her sins, as I knew he would do nothing to shield his mistress; the love of his life. Two other women in this situation should also have regrets; his wife should regret staying with him after finding out he is a cheater, and his mistress for staying after he allowed her to take the fall.
-3	negative	regrets	I feel grossed out and ashamed. I tried this app called Skout hoping I could meet someone. JUST NEVER DO IT IT'S HORRIBLE AND I FEEL NOT MYSELF!!!!
-14	negative	regrets	I feel like at times I am slow at growing. I feel like although I know that I am a certain age, I don't share the experiences that some of my peers have had. I am not trying to judge them or myself or compare our lives. But I was just thinking to myself - Is this where I am supposed to be in life right now? I know that's a silly question because there is not right or wrong way to live life. You live the life that is for you. Certainly some people have it easier and some people have it harder - some people have more obstacles and some people have an easier path. But I was just thinking, I don't want to be late all the time to certain life experiences Perhaps I just need to stop thinking and 'do'. 
-6	negative	regrets	I feel like I failed at life. The man I loved more than anything left me three months ago like all the years we spent together meant nothing. It wasn't the first time. People have the tendency of leaving me alone once they don't need my assistance. Nobody can love me, for some reason. Maybe I'm damned But I'm going to end this pain. Finish it at last.
-3	negative	regrets	I feel like i have a lot side . These are my side.                                                                   1.  i used to be inoncent,naive lonely girl.                                 2. I used to act agresive and i get mad easily.                                                                3.i used to be so cold and say mean things.           What do you think?
-2	negative	regrets	I feel like I'm a big disappointment becuz I never did anything or said anything the way I should have.:- 
-11	negative	regrets	I feel the same way, through out my life I've been the out cast I never had a chance to experience life in a healthy way a loving way. My mom was mentally ill and she was never home. So when my brother rapd me at age 5 I didn't know what was happening. every time we would try and ask my mom a question we got yelled at or beat. So no I learned at that age how scared I was to even be there. So thats why now today I live my life  to the fullest and I say what I fee what l think but sometimes it doesn't seem to work but thats okay. 
-14	negative	regrets	If I had known that 15 years later I would feel the same things for you, I would have asked you out back then. When I look at you now, I still see that smokin hot 21 year old goth that had the best sense of humor. I see the way you grew up, and how you changed. I see the way you are still the same. I wish I had told you then because I think we'd both be saying how happy we are, instead of talking about our loveless marriages. If I knew then what I know now, there would be no secret crush that I kept to myself.  
-3	negative	regrets	If I knew then what I know now, I would have certainly done more, would have took all I could, stayed longer, payed more attention, and would have declared, "Again!"
-3	negative	regrets	If i knew then , what i know now  Life would be waaaay much easier .
-5	negative	regrets	I find humans does allot of stupid things.  Between drinking, smoking, harming the environment,  wars and many other things we don't need in the world.  But allot of humans don't care. They want their pleasure, they want their power and they don't care if it may cause harm to them self or others. This is what makes most humans stupid!
-4	negative	regrets	If I only I had known the answers before I did something really stupid I wouldn't have made such a fool of myself.   Guess that's just part of life though.  
-16	negative	regrets	I first experienced suicide in 1973.  I was 17.  It was a snowy March day when I was driving home from high school and I saw the sheriff and the ambulance in front of my house.   My little brother who was a freshman in high school was in the passenger seat.  We saw them carrying out my dad in a body bag.  Dad had shot himself.  I never understood why.  I never thought anything was wrong and I never got to say goodbye.  Why, dad, why?  He was always there for me, then he wasn't. My 19 year old daughter is all I have left and now I worry about her when she gets a little sad.  She has also expressed the same concern about me.
-5	negative	regrets	I f n hate it when service is poor. Yeah, that's you EP. You are obviously experiencing difficulties. Is it too much to ask for a "sorry we're working on the problem" message from this EPAllie chick that was all up on my junk as soon as I joined? Oh, waitthat's a questionYOU PROBABLY CAN'T F N ANSWER IT!!!!!
-1	negative	regrets	If only I could I would change everything I did that I regret
-4	negative	regrets	If only I could take back what I said or did to make him leave me. To take back everything that happened would mean I could have my happiness back. I could live a day without wanting to cut my skin to shreds.
-10	negative	regrets	If only I knew about the Lord Jesus when I was youngerif only someone would have taken the time to explain salvation to me and what a life lived for the Lord looked likeif only someone would have loved me enough back then, things could have been very different. Yet I know Him now! And He has made all things new! He has given me joy, peace and an abundance of loveif only I could tell everyone about Him now
-2	negative	regrets	If this could've happen I would be living the life of my desire
-2	negative	regrets	I gave one girl 3 chances to be with me, she blew all if them because of her friends. Moral is don't give away something that won't last.
-2	negative	regrets	I go back in time and stop my parents condemning me to this life, by stopping them conceiving me, (causing a paradox, but so what!)
-6	negative	regrets	I got accepted into Penn State, and I can't afford to go to school there what am I going to do. The college is paying for most of my education with scholarships, but ran out of on campus housing. An I can't afford the off campus housing I have to give them almost 1000 every few months. How am I going to make it?
-11	negative	regrets	I had a friend her and i loved each other like we were family. we hung out nearly everyday and often skyped and often talked over the internet too. during this summer i was in Florida for the whole summer. she had family fairly close to where i was staying and wanted to surprise me with a visit. On her way there it started raining really bad, her cousin who was driving couldn't see the stopped semi truck in front of themthey rear-ended the semi and killed her instantly and severely injured her cousin..everyday i think of her. she will always have a place in my heart and will always be in my heart no matter what :') 
-3	negative	regrets	I had a sealpoint siamese named Mowgli, she had seizures and the day she passed away I was napping. She had a really bad convulsing seizure & I didn't get her medicine in time. I feel horrible even though it was over a year ago, and I feel like it's my fault.
-5	negative	regrets	I had to have a lung transplant a few months back because of a rare lung disorder. Believe me, breathing air into healthy lungs and blowing it back out feels amazing!!! Walking up a flight of stairs without huffing and puffing makes me want to laugh. Seeing a group of people standing outside smoking  makes me want to throw things at them. I just don't understand why people want to ruin perfectly good lungs when they don't have to. Makes no sense to me. 
-4	negative	regrets	I hate causing people pain. I strongly prefer to make people feel good and happy. However, I know that I have caused pain, both with and without intent.Even the pain that I have caused simply because I am not the person that they wanted me to be makes me feel bad. I am sorry that I have hurt my family, but I can't change who I am. However, I am not proud of the fact that it has caused them distress. 
-10	negative	regrets	I hate that Facebook and iMessage tell when your message has been seen or delivered, because it makes my feelings for you seem so obsessive. You must know by now that it's hard for me even to trust someone anymore, let alone like them or love them. And you know I do. So why play with me like this? It feels like I'm just part of the bill that you've written off, said there must have been a mistake, that the mistake was me, and you will take no responsibility in it. I feel like a stone, cast down a river, skipping the one, two, and three times that you looped me in and then let me go, letting me sink to the bottom of the ocean that is our relationship. And can you even call it that when you skip the bill, and leave it written off when all is said and done?
-3	negative	regrets	I hate the word "retarded" it drives me crazy when someone says that about a handicap or disabled person..it's so rude..I hear it everyday and it makes me so mad
-2	negative	regrets	I hate when people are like ok just come talk to me when you have a problem  And you're Likeyeah that's why I don't tell anyone
-4	negative	regrets	I have a huge regret,its like its hounting me. I came to realize that what has happend was an excuse for me to accept him if he ever hurts me 
-5	negative	regrets	I have a problem of letting the little things bother me. I have a little in Tau Beta Sigma . She is a great little her name is Kiyla. She is an awesome person and shows such passion for the environment and tbs. She has gone through some troubles and I try to be there as much possible. But right now she is not speaking to me and I have no idea why. I wish I need how to reach out to her.
-12	negative	regrets	I have been dealing with this disorder since 2002-2003.  I have paralysis to my right side, difficulty speaking and have been in & out of hospitals, only to be sent home.   I was recently hospitalized on 10/1/13 because of twisting of my mouth.  It came out of nowhere.  I was fine the day before!   It is true though that once the CD is given to you, people, hospital personnel, doctors, treat you differently.  One of my doctors told me that it is "all in your head".  You have to will it so".  Of course, this really is frustrating for me.  I have lost hope.  I am tired, and I hate what it is doing to my son as well.   It is not in my head!  It is real.  I'm waiting for financial assistance from work and the SSA.  Everything is pending or in review.  I have no income coming in and is facing eviction from my apartment within the next 25 days.  I need help.  Any suggestions?  I am so frustrated. 
-10	negative	regrets	I have been foolish enough to send naked pictures to guys because I craved their approval but it wasnt of me for who I am their approval was of my body that's all they cared about. I am better now I know who I am and don't care what others think!
-9	negative	regrets	I have been married 17 yearsMy husband is a control freak.he checks my phone calls me ALL the time to see if i am ok(right) and he has managed to make everyone in my family mad at him with pretty bad comments I tell him hardly anyone likes him and he thinks i am crazy. I would leave if i had not quit my job to take care of my dad. I also have to account for every dime of HIS money i spend. I pray for a way out but just can not happen right now.
-7	negative	regrets	I have been suffering from debilitating anxiety and panic attacks for the past few years. It got so bad that just the thought of having another anxiety attack actually triggered one. But after finding a site that adequately explained what anxiety attacks are, I have been able to prevent myself from having another one.It starts with rejecting negative thoughts and regarding them as just that negative thoughts. If you can manage to steer your mind away from these negative thoughts, instead of feeding them, you can prevent yourself from triggering your own anxiety attacks. I for one have found this approach very effective thus far.
-1	negative	regrets	I have been suffering with PTDS,Anxiety, 
-1	negative	regrets	I have changed once or twice before. I am so so sorry.
-3	negative	regrets	I have done so many bad things. They make me feel dirty. Tainted. Worthless. I  hate myself for doing them and I still havent forgiven myself. I don't know if i ever will. This is something i will carry, as a way of redemption. As a reminder of how ugly I can really be.
-6	negative	regrets	I have done so many things in my life that I regret. But who hasn't nobody is perfect and we all make mistakes. May not be as worse as the things I have done but what I done in the past I knew was going to stick with me my whole life. So i tell myself a little quote my brother told medon't live in yesterday live for today. Cause tomorrow isn't promised. 
-5	negative	regrets	I have done something despicable. Something I will never be proud of in my whole life. I murdered my 17 year old neighbor. It was out of jealousy. I will never forgive myself. Ever. I still have nightmares. I just want to die now. I am an awful, disgusting person.
-1	negative	regrets	I have done things I'm ashamed of.but I'm not who I used to be anymore, and I just have to work on not dwelling in the past.
-2	negative	regrets	I have done too many bad things, and wish I could start over. I sometimes seem to mess up the good things that I have. I embarrass myself too much, also. 
-4	negative	regrets	I have gained some, well alot, of weight since the weather started getting colder and my depression has gotten alot worse. I am soo depressed that I just can not motivate myself to take care of myself the way I need to to eat right and get some kind of exercise.
-9	negative	regrets	I have loads of regrets but here is my biggest one of all. Six years ago i met the girl of dreams and we were strong together for 2 years, i mean whenever i was with her i felt invincible and unstoppable then what did i go a do i ended it stupid me. I have never gotten over her and would give anything to turn back time but she's moved on had a kid and gotten married, guess you really don't know what you got till its gone :/
-1	negative	regrets	I have made many mistakes in my life, such as liking women that don't really like me , but like to use me.
-15	negative	regrets	I have made many mistakes in my life which are to long to list all of them here, but the biggest mistake I have made is not being who I wanted to be.  Now I am on the road to fixing that issue right now.   I have already got permission from my first therapist to be allowed to take female hormones.  I just started with my second therapist here recently.  I found out the hard way that I needed two therapists permission to start to take hormones.  Another mistake I soon found out I had made.  It is going to take me longer in my progress, but I am on the road to fixing the biggest mistake I have ever made and that is not being who I was meant to be. 
-9	negative	regrets	I have made more mistakes than I care to remember. And most of you won't even think they are mistakes , just me being a normal exploring teen. But the way I was raised, what I did was bad.  I know mistakes help you grow and become a better person as long as you learn from them, the problem is I don't always learn. Especially when it comes to the internet. There are just too many temptations and I can't keep pushing against it I am not a bad person or anything and I don't want people to think I have no control, but I have hormones :P Like any other young person. This doesn't mean I am gonna sleep around and get pregnant, but ti does lead to some uncomfortable situations *sigh*   I really wish it was easier not to make mistakes cause at some point you just give up and go with it.  
-4	negative	regrets	I have made plenty of mistakes in my life, and I continue to make plenty more each and every day. I don't keep making the same mistakes, granted. I'm not that stubborn. I prefer to make all new mistakes instead. I'm of the mentality that, as humans, we have the benefit of learning from our mistakes. Therefore I don't see my mistakes as mistakes at all. Instead I choose to see them as opportunities for me to grow a little bit more with each passing day.
-7	negative	regrets	I Have Made Plenty of Mistakes in My Life. I'm sure you have made many, too. Whether they be spelling mistakes or the mistake of trusting the wrong people. We all make mistakes. FUCK! I wish I could say I have made plenty of mistakes and that I'm okay with that, but really? I'm not. 
-5	negative	regrets	I have made so many mistakes in my life. I regret them sometimes but I try not to dwell on the past. I try looking at those mistakes as a learning experience. When you make the same mistakes over and over again, then that I would say is a problem. Making a mistake once and learning from it is part of the growing that we need to become who we want to be. I always say "live and learn".
-15	negative	regrets	I have never heard any guy telling me that I am beautiful.Some people might say 'So what? You should believe that you are beautiful." That is true.Very true.But I do not believe that I am. No guy has ever been attracted to me.Not even one. And that makes me think twice before I can call myself beautiful. I believe that I am a good person,kind hearted by nature and a good listener.People say that you should be beautiful from the inside,and I believe that I am. But,is that enough?  It just makes me sad,that almost all my friends are in a relationship.And I don't want to be in one,just for the sake of being in it.I just want to be loved.I want a guy to look into my eyes and say ' You are beautiful'. 
-5	negative	regrets	I have never loved anyone more than my dog Bear.  He was perfect and now he is gone.  He blessed my life for over 12 years and I am having a real hard time getting over it.  I don't want another pet I just want him.  He never made me mad or frustrated no matter what he did, he could do anything and I would just laugh.  He was so smart, he was a collie, german shepard mix but I had to put him down because he could not walk anymore.  I hope he has forgiven me.  I am lucky to have had him as my best friend.  He was the best dog ever!
-4	negative	regrets	I haven't seen my MM this year, not spent hours on the phone like we always have either.  We had a short visit between Christmas and New Years,  it seemed different I don't know if he was just in a hurry or if after 5 years he's finally losing interest.  I feel lost.
-3	negative	regrets	I have one regret, that is that I had to quit Archery because of my physical health issues.
-1	negative	regrets	I have regrets.   Interesting to write it out. 
-6	negative	regrets	"I have regrets" is an understatement. I can not count the number of regrets I have, nor how to fully move on from them. There are so many things I wish I would have done differently - no wait, I SHOULD have! If only I would have done each of these regretful things differently, then I wouldn't be in the situation I am in now. Or at least I hope to think that would be the case. My regrets will always contain me. They'll always have control over me. No matter how much I wish that they didn't and wouldn't
-1	negative	regrets	I have so many reasons and events to want to go back in time but I'm afraid the outcome of changing anything would not be a good one probably worse. Ever watched the BUTTERFLY EFFECT?
-7	negative	regrets	I have this idea I'm my head about leaving. It's so vivid I can definitely see it happening. I see me and a friend or two, driving in my car to California. Music loud. Being wild. Barely any money. Feeling the breeze with the windows down. Barely any clothes. Just driving and driving, enjoying the feeling of being free. I don't care about money or taxes or jobs the hipster life seems just right for me. I want to do what I please. I can't wait until the day I get in my car and look over to my friends and say "Let drive!" I'm going to be gone 'Into the wild' is the perfect movie example of what I want to do.
-10	negative	regrets	I have thought about running away often but lately I have realized it would not change a thing. I think I just want to be someone else. I have allowed people to walk all over me my whole life. I try to make everyone happy. I think if I were to run away and start over I would be stronger and more independent. I have given my dependence away and now I have nothing. If I were to leave I would still be the same person tho. I would just be in a different place. After all I cannot run away from me. 
-15	negative	regrets	I have to be the best at everything. I have made Advanced Math every year, except this coming year. I have the highest IQ in my grade, made an 110% score in math (extra credit), but apparently the placement test was during when I had a sinus infection and was lightheaded, and they don't retest students. My OAA scores coming in this summer may have an effect on their decision, but I may be put in -gulp- regular math for two weeks so they can watch me while my slightly-less-intelligent friends sit happily in Advanced. I don't mean to sound condescending, but I am the smartest in my grade, according to IQ. They announced it, that I was the smartest. I tested better than my teachers, but that one test put me lower. I cried for days about it and felt idiotic. I'm doing better, but just writing this makes me feel like I might cry. I try not to think about it.
-8	negative	regrets	I have to say there are lots of mistakes I have made big and small, I regret them so much, especially one, sometimes it hurts. At the end of the day I can't go back an change my mistakes but I can try and learn from them and in the future make a better job of it, or at least try. No matter how much I get judged in my mistakes and I know I do, I'm the one who has to live with it, not people who judge me, and you should never judge someone until you have walked around in their shoes. It's not fair. Life isn't fair, but if we keep our chin up and stay hopeful, things tend to look up.  Learn from your mistakes don't dwell on them too much
-2	negative	regrets	I have trust issues with my therapist that I've had for three years now. I love her and she's like a mother to me. Lately I've been acting out because I don't want to lose her. I don't want to get better and not have to see her anymore. I'm not sure what I should do about this problem. Help!
-7	negative	regrets	I have worked in disabilities for many years and couldn't think of anything more fulfilling to do for work. Some of the best people I have known I met through this work. Two of my sons have disabilities and every day is a struggle, but I wouldn't change it for anything. They are beautiful just as they are. I have learned so much from so many people who are considered different. I love different. I am different because of you. Thank you to the different ones who made me feel like I was home!
-4	negative	regrets	I just do mistakes. I'm a mistake. A person say than people are like but I'm not so amazing. I just accept other people like they are and like I want to ne accept to other.
-2	negative	regrets	I just need to find my other half, I know she's out there somewhere, feeling exactly how I am right now
-1	negative	regrets	I just want someone to run their fingers through my hair.
-4	negative	regrets	I just want to run away. Pack a bag, get on a bus, and see where it takes me. I want to get away from here and start fresh somewhere new. I hate the past and I want to make a new present so I can have a better future.
-4	negative	regrets	I just went through a bad break up and the first thing i thought was "maybe cutting again will stop the pain" but i was afraid that If i started i wouldnt stop again.. My freshman year of high school I would cut myself on a regular basis. A year after that I stopped. So after this break up a few days ago I wanted to feel pain to make me feel better. I didnt want to cut so i figured out a different to get the pain of hurting myself without something that would kill me. For Christmas my dad got me a guitar. I kept playing it over and over again until my fingers hurt and started to get calluses. It made me feel better, got the feelings of hurting myself, and now im better at the guitar! 
-1	negative	regrets	I keep getting flashbacks of what I have done in my past which are embarrassing and makes me ashamed of myself. The thoughts jump into my head randomly and it's horrible 
-1	negative	regrets	I know a lot of people that r disabled but when people bully them, I get down and dirty
-23	negative	regrets	I know how you feel:/ I had gotten a pitbull mix when he was 7 weeks old. I had him for about 4 months . When we got him we didn't realize that dogs weren't allowed were we lived.he is about 4 1/2 months . Today in the morning the landlord came and when he saw tiger(dog) he said that we had to get rid of him..my heart dropped . I did not want to give him away! He was my BESTFRIEND we did every thing together he followed me every were. He was so sweet he lived kids and other dogs but the landlord didn't budge . I had to give him to this no-kill shelter in Greenwich . When I dropped him of I burst into tears! I could hear him whining when they took him. I can't get over him he was my best friend I don't know what I'm going to do with ought him
-2	negative	regrets	I know I do. Actually, I do more often than I'd like. I try my best but sometimes even my best efforts fall flat. 
-5	negative	regrets	I know I made a lot of mistakes in my life but each and every mistake made me stronger and I grew from the lessons I learnt out of it, I'm not afraid to say I'm sorry but would expect you to do so too if you we're wrong 
-2	negative	regrets	I know I'm still considered young but I still have a lot of regrets. Those idiotic and stupid mistakes.
-23	negative	regrets	I learned life isn't promised with how many loved ones I've lost, I learned love isn't always real when he walked out that door. I learned family may not always be there when she picked drugs over me. I learned I wasn't as strong when the cuts started too become deeper or when the cravings hard started. I learned I didn't want too live anymore, when I took them pills. I cried when I wasn't successful, I was tired of the pain. I grew depressed by looking myself in the mirror, because I started too think I was the one who wasn't good enough.. Sooner or later, I decided too get help and when the help came, little by little I was realizing I was better than this life, I could break the circle. Today, I learned that nothing bad last forever & you could make it, if you really want too. I learned not too regret because everything you been there & did only made you the strong person that you are today (:
-1	negative	regrets	I let something happened that I should not have. It still haunts me. But, such is life.
-2	negative	regrets	I look at what they have written and I can't read it. It reminds me of custom license plates and trying to decipher those. I just can't read most of then easily. So, I say grow up and learn proper English. 
-7	negative	regrets	I look back over the years and I truly have no regrets. I have made very poor choices and took the easy roads way to frequently. I look at my life as a puzzle and some of the pieces aren't in place, or I took some out of the completed puzzle and I am replacing them.
-9	negative	regrets	I lost Helen just this Monday.  She was the sweetest little girl.  She was diagnosed about a week and a half with chylothorax.  I had many test done and they could not find a reason for it.  No tumor, cancer, or heart disease.  Her chest kept filling with fluid.  We had 2 chest taps in a week both times they removed 200 ml of fluid, which is a lot.  I prayed she was gonna be alright and had fooled myself into believing it.  Monday when I got home she could barely breath.  We took her to the emergency vet knowing we would not be bringing her back.  I still can't believe she is gone.  I still can't believe we had to make that choice.  She was only 4 yrs old.  I don't know how to let her go.  I feel so sad, mad, guilty, lost.  
-2	negative	regrets	I lost many close friends in my life and it doesn't hurt me as much as I thought it would it's weird. But yet again I'm a weird person lol
-1	negative	regrets	I lost my grandma in July 13'. No pain, no cancer, no tears.
-2	negative	regrets	I love the look and feel of most of Victoria's thingsproblem isI am a Lane Bryant sized gurl
-6	negative	regrets	I'm 13 and i'm 5'5 I'm currently in 7th, I'm Latina and most Latinos are known for being short. Anyway, most people in my grade are in the 4's-5'3s. I feel so huge and uncomfortable. I just wish i was short . And everywhere i go i seem to be taller than everyone else. 
-10	negative	regrets	I'm 19 years old and I had an abortion 7 months ago. I was 10 weeks so I had the pill. At the time me and my partner were so in shock we made a quick decision and I could tell he really didn't want me to keep it. When at the hospital I wasn't even upset until I saw the foetus/baby come out. I was told by the nurses it was probably best not to look but I couldn't help it and was looking at it for a good few minutes before breaking down. After the nurses took it away I calmed down and for the rest of the day I was upset but not that much. 7 months on and I can't stop thinking about it. I've got the image of it in my head and I can't stop thinking 'what if'. The only thing I want in life is to be a mum and when I had the chance I threw it away. It's getting me so down, I don't know what to do or who to speak to because my boyfriend doesn't know what to say. It's the worst pain and I know it will never go away.
-1	negative	regrets	I''m 23 never been kissed or any such thing. I suspect when I do have my first kiss it will be with someone special
-5	negative	regrets	I'm a college student in his second year. Up until 12th grade of high school, I managed to be a straight A student who worked really hard for his results but didn't have much of a social life. In 12th grade, I let myself go in terms of education and health. I somehow ended up making some of the most amazing, intelligent, sophisticated, and entertaining friends I could ever ask for.  
-16	negative	regrets	I made a big mistake when I was in sixth grade. And to this day I still feel terrible. I had a lot of mixed girl problems. I didn't want to be biracial and I didnt want to look different. When my father came to school one day to drop off my lunch, my friends asked me who the white guy was and instead of telling them he was my father, I just told him he was my stepfather. I had always told them I was black and had mixed grandparents. I didn't want them to know I was a mutt. I was more concerned about what my black would think about me. I just didnt want people to know. I didnt want to go back to being teased or being asked ridiculous questions. I am ashamed that I was ashamed. I was just very ignorant and afraid. I soon started going out of my way to introduce my friends to be father to make up for what I did and relieve my guilt. If my father ever knew I'd be devestated. I love my dad and today I'm proud of who I am. I am black and i am white. I could never think of doing that again. 
-9	negative	regrets	I made a mistake that is not reversable, has long lasting effects.  I didn't want to fail like I did.  It's one of those mistakes a person does when looking for something they feel they haven't got, and has issues to deal with from long ago not worked out.  I had things in my head I needed to resolve.  Anyway, as a result I lost the one I thought I loved.  It was 3 years ago and I can't move on. I know I shouldn't think on the past mistakes.  Sometimes it's difficult not to when the consequences are so big.
-4	negative	regrets	I made a promise to  and i don't know if i'll be able to fulfill it We said we'd go to japan. And i'd stay with her but it's not easy. I still need to finish highschool and try collegewithout financial support :/ plus i'm moving out in the summer i think.. It's hard as it is going to school and paying rent trying to survive. Can i really save up to go abroad to Japan? But then again. If i'm not afraid of death why am i afraid of financial issues? 
-13	negative	regrets	I'm always here for anybody who needs someone to talk to. I'm a great listener. If you're depressed or going through a tough time and just need someone to listen to you, that's what I'm here for. If you'd like a friend that's always here for you all you have to do is message me or just comment here and I'll without a doubt respond to your message. I look forward to talking with you soon  Have a good day.

-3	negative	regrets	I may be young but I have gone through a lot. I don't judge I try my best to look at not just one side and give an honest opinion. At the age of 17 I joined the military and got out at 23. So ask me advice or whatever you want I'll answer to the best of my ability.
-4	negative	regrets	I met him a year and eight days ago. We were best friends for a long time. But then I did something stupid. Now, if I'm lucky, we talk every few months.
-6	negative	regrets	I'm feeling so melancholy and unable to deal with the long holiday weekend or the parties. At least my work distracts me from this feeling and gives me a sense of purpose. I want to turn my phone off and disappear. I'd go somewhere totally desolate, calm, peaceful. Just myself, my wine, my negative thoughts. Surrounded by nature. Let the trees absorb my bad thoughts and mental anguish, then come home feeling much lighter.
-4	negative	regrets	I'm going to tell anyone who will listen. My expirience with drugs. (E, crack, coke) But I'm not really in the mood to write a novel. So I'll continue this another day. 
-1	negative	regrets	I'm hard in myself because every time i do something wrong, i get yelled at and it makes me not want to continue on, i shut down.
-1	negative	regrets	I might be a bit old to run away, but if I get laid off from my current job I'm going to sell my life and run away.
-14	negative	regrets	I miss him so much.But I think he's the one who supports me,he's my guardian angel and has helped me through this rough time.There were times I couldn't breath times I thought I would never recover.But now somehow I have started to move on with the support of my friends and family.I read so many experiences of people and discovered that I'm not alone there are so many people who have suffered like me.Lost someone they loved.Time doesn't really heal wounds it just makes you used to it.I still miss him so much,without him my life has become so empty.But somehow I have learned to live with this emptyness 
-1	negative	regrets	I miss my mommy so much being so far away from her makes me sad but I know at the end if the day she would walk a distance just to make sure I'm good
-15	negative	regrets	I miss someone who I considered my best friend (male). I could hit him up any day at any time and i know he would respond. He always listened, he always gave me his honest opinion, supported me and I never felt judge by him. I admired him as a person and then developed a crush. I put him on a pedestal because I believed he had the qualities in a men that I would see myself with. I would compare the guys I was dating with him and wondered what it would be like to be with someone like him. Long story short, after six years of liking this fantasy guy I called my best friend, he kissed me and we hooked up. it was amazing. It felt so real, so meant to be, like a real connection. :-/ He said he didn't want anything serious. My heart broke I felt played. Now I miss our friendship. I don't regret it but if I could go back I would take back that kiss and keep his friendship.
-1	negative	regrets	I'm mostly writing this story for the people I'm friends with on EP so that I don't have to write each one a personal message. Love, Mommy
-8	negative	regrets	I'm moving to Hawaii by the end of the year, and i'm 7days sober off meth now. and i know it will be good for me but i'm scared because meth is really big there, i don't have very much will power. i'm thinking of going to NA meetings when i get there but i haven't made the full decision to go yet. i don't know how to make friends at all and if anything i'm going to have older friends around my mom's age. i'm not sure what to make of it other than i hope i don't relapse before i can get there.  
-7	negative	regrets	I'm no stranger to loss. I've lost things, contacts, or friends. But I have especially experienced a lot of deaths. I've lost most of my closest friends and family over the years. By about a couple of years ago, all my best friends and closest friends from high school had died. (I'm just 33.) All my grandparents are gone, my father, many of my uncles and my closest ones, other good friends and neighbors, my pets, and in this age, some of my closest on line friends have passed away as well. My childhood sweetheart recently passed away. One of my cousins was murdered when she was about 21, we were the same age and had the same first name but were both called by shortened nicknames. My best friend and my cousins wife, who was a mother of six, both died waiting for transplants.
-1	negative	regrets	I'm not perfect neither are you. I don't care if I'm not because I've learned to love my imperfections.
-16	negative	regrets	I'm not sure if this is going to help me. I really don't see what can right now. I lost my best friend of 23 years. I met him when I was 17 and he was 21. He was so adorable. I'm sure he would hate for me to describe him that way, but he was. It's strange but we never married. I always felt married in my heart and I think he felt that way too. We have an amazing 21 year old son together.  How I ended up having raised such a wonderful kid is beyond me, because I don't deserve him.      The weight is crushing. It pushes me in on myself and I can't breath. I can't see a way past this pain. Everyone says time will heal all things and maybe it does. But right now all I see is the endless time without him.
-2	negative	regrets	I'm not the type of person that ever hurts people. I'm usually the one picking up the pieces, helping to restore friendships, keeping the peace, or helping people move on. I never thought I'd be on the other end. I never thought I would hurt someone, especially the way that I did. I honestly have never been more ashamed, disgusted, or horrible feeling.  I don't know what to do. I don't know how to earn their trust back. I can't fix it, I know that But I wish so badly I could turn back time and take it all back.
-5	negative	regrets	I'm on here to find friends to have a chat about anything. I'm not here for dating etc so please don't ask as I'm not interested. I live with my partner and would never cheat on him as I love him to bits.
-1	negative	regrets	Imperfect like everyone i know.
-2	negative	regrets	I'm sad. I don't feel like I'll ever find my partner at this point. Impatient. I stayed in bed all day today. I tried to get up and do something but had no motivation. I don't want to do things by myself. I want someone to do them with.
-9	negative	regrets	I'm sending this out to the one place that i know it can get lost, somewhere in cyberspace. Somewhere where my words can't hurt anyone and have no consequences. Everyday i wake up hoping it was just a nightmare. Just this sick twisted horrible thing that i read somewhere else in the world just not my world.  But it's  not. It's not a nightmare, its our life.  I know that I failed as a mother to protect her. And I know that it will take a very long time before she can ever forgive me for that but I do pray everyday that she will at some point. I love my baby very much, no matter how much she shuts me out. She is a part of my heart that i need, that makes me whole. 
-3	negative	regrets	I'm Southern. I have a very thick accent at times. When non-southerners hear this, they automatically assume I'm a backwoods, idgit. They actually speak slower like I may not understand them. It's obnoxious. Usually I wait for their insulting speech to end and then I come back at them like an auctioneer. I finish with, "Did ya get all that, darlin'?"
-5	negative	regrets	I'm standing guard what I said of me starting to not liking people. The only living things I like is nature and animals. 
-6	negative	regrets	I'm the kind of person who tries to see the good in everyone. I believe in second chances and redemption. I was brought up this way. I love the quote by Jim Morrison that some of his worst mistakes have been haircuts. I hope that's going to be my only mistake too. 
-7	negative	regrets	I'm tired..I'm tired of crying. I can't help it. I miss him so much that I will drown myself in whiskey and vodka hoping that I wont wake up sometimes. I don't care how selfish it sounds. My dreams, my future, my everything was ripped tragically away from me and I'm left here to try and pick up the pieces.and by myself. I just am not strong enough even though I was for him when he was here. I was always strong when he was here.  Why not take me? He had so much to live for. I've done so much already. Why not someone else? I just want to be with him again. 
-5	negative	regrets	Indeed, a lot of them I am not proud of. But tbh, I don't really regret any. They all have made me a better person in some sort of way. I try to live my life without regrets. There was a point in my life I had so many regrets.. All because I was dwelling in the past which has made me depressed. Then I realized I couldn't change the past. I'm only in control of the future in most ways.
-2	negative	regrets	I need to make some cash to pay rent for me and my girlfriend while I am working and attending college. I am not looking for a hand out but will work for the extra money. Please feel free to email me and let me know how YOU could be a help.
-3	negative	regrets	I need to put my 16+ year old yellow lab to sleep, should I bring his best buddy, also a 3 year old lab, to the vet with us to be apart of putting him down so he is aware of what's happening, and so he knows why we didn't bring the old one home? or will he understand? Any thoughts on this will be appreciated.I am going to do this Tuesday. Pray I have the strength. I will see all of my animals in heaven. Scott
-6	negative	regrets	I need to run away RIGHT NOW, but I have nowhere to go, so I'm running here to EP to write this, in the hope that writing will help unburden the tension I feel in my body, and the frustration I have in my mind.I just want to SCREEEEEEEM!!! Or, hit a punch bag, or run, or something. I have to leave, and I have to start the process this week. I can't put it off until the time is right. I have to leave, and it has to be soon.
-3	negative	regrets	I never could but I have wished to have the courage to run away many times I think Tom Petty said it best:
-1	negative	regrets	I never had a birthday party 
-4	negative	regrets	In my email this morning were 15 messages from Psychic Source offering me 50% off their online psychic readings.If they were REALLY psychic, wouldnt they already know I dont want their crap?
-8	negative	regrets	In my younger days, I was even stupider than I am now. I loved the thrill of danger. I did a few more drugs than I probably should have. The same applies to women. It made me who I am today. Without that life, I wouldn't have my kids, though. God truly can use evil to show his goodness and mercy.
-3	negative	regrets	In scared to talk, even to people like yourselves  about what I really think and feel. Possibly because I feel like I'm deceiving the people already in my life by not telling them. But I suppose some things are better left unsaid. I hope that going forward I can build relationships that start off with 100% honesty so I can reveal my character.
-1	negative	regrets	Interesting how bullies are cool ( bad behavior by choice) but disabled people are not respected  (they were BORN disabled , NO CHOICE). The human stupidity is the final proof that the Devil exist , someone must whisper those nonsense in our ears .
-2	negative	regrets	In the beginning, you will either be completely intrigued by who I am, or you don't care for it. Doesn't matter. I don't stress about that part. It either is or iI isn't.  
-5	negative	regrets	In the process of trying to correct the mistakes I've made which messed up my life, I made even more mistakes and dug myself into more trouble. Now, I'm taking a break from trying to "fix" things. I'm almost scared to try anything else. I don't want to mess things up more than I have these past few years. 
-6	negative	regrets	I often wish I could run away from everything I know and go to some isolated place where no one knows who I am. Where I don't have responsibilities and can forget all of my memories. I could be alone if I wanted to and no one would bother me. Even though I have friends and memories that I like, there isn't anything that keeps me here except for the fact that I'm too young to go anywhere.  I know that if I'm not happy here, I won't be happy anywhere else. Yet I still imagine it's possible. I just wish I could breathe again. I don't think I ever knew what that felt like.
-3	negative	regrets	i once got asked for id when i was 30 ! ha ha i look around thirty now and am almost forty ! its good ..i can wear young clothes and get away with it .
-4	negative	regrets	I once lies to my wonderful small group leaders! I said I prayed for my old friends uncle to be healthy but I didn't! I cannot believe I even shared that! They actually believed me too.
-8	negative	regrets	I only wish I could go back in time when I'm not happy with reality. Right now is so difficult. I wish I could go back to summer and stay there forever. Everything was easier, I felt happier. I had you and I never wanted to let you go. But I would go back to when you never walked away. When I felt loved by life and not stomped on and kicked down. I guess I can only visit the past in my dreams now. I miss when reality was better than my dreams.
-8	negative	regrets	I ordered something two day delivery from Chicago to Frederick, Md.  I ordered it December 17.  USPS lost it in Illinois.  It showed up in town on Christmas Eve.  Mark at the Frederick post office said it was on its way to my house.  It never showed up.  They ruined a nice part of my daughter's Christmas.  Shame on them.  They lied to me enough on Christmas just enough so I didn't run out and get a replacement.
-1	negative	regrets	I prefer to look at everything as a challenge. Why be good when you can be great!
-15	negative	regrets	I pretended to be someone I'm not. I always do. But this time I used someone else's picture. Being who I am just never got me anywhere. I wanted and needed to be someone else for a little while. I needed to No i didn't need to I wanted to. I just wanted to be that person evryone wants to be friends with. The person everyone wants to be. The person everyone wants. And I was. Technically. I felt good. I felt what I wanted to feel Now, I lost everything and everyone And All i can think about is who I'm going to pretend to be now.
-4	negative	regrets	I recently got my heart broken, I heard about this new show that helps you get over your ex and answer questions (exandwhycasting.com) I am thinking about applying, what do you think?
-5	negative	regrets	I regret being being too afraid of what will happen to take chances. My friend had a party last night, and I was in the last group to be leaving. Only I know that I've started to fall for him. It sounds really silly, but I regret not hugging him. I had the perfect opportunity, but I was too scared of what he would think to do it; however, it's possible that I was more awkward in the way I walked away than if I would have just went for it. In all actuality, he probably would not have thought anything about it, but I just could not bring myself to do it, for the second time now. I really wish I knew the way his arms feel around me though, so next time I have already made up my mind to do it without a second thought.
-2	negative	regrets	I regret giving up the one I love when I was 16. I'm not sure if I would have made a different choice if I could do it again, but it would be great if I could just return to the past. At least I wouldn't have kept everything to myself.
-4	negative	regrets	I regret my choices when it came to me sinning against my religion, or when it came to my love life and how I pushed away someone I loved for 3 years. I regret how easily I forgave my father at times when he would treat me and my mom like s**t on his shoe. I regret trying so hard to make people think I was cool, that I ruined my reputation. I regret saying the wrong thing and speaking before thinking and making myself look like a complete .
-11	negative	regrets	I said something really horrible I mean really horrible. Probaly one of the most mean things you can to a person. I told a teacher when I was 14/15 who annoyed me  "I wish you were dead".   I was meant to be in insolation at lunchtime which is when you can't go to class, have a break, see, speak to any of your friends. I ended up chatting to my friend down a corridor though anyway. I later apologised to the member  of staff and I think she said " I knew you didn't me it". I'm so glad she never thought I meant it because the truth is I never did mean it.
-10	negative	regrets	I seriously can't stand it! I know this boy who was born with something wrong with him. A lot of people was very cruel to him but a couple of us always took up for him. He was honestly my best friend for many of years now. A lot of people just didn't have patience to try to take time to get to understand him, but if you just listened to him you would understand everything. Just because someone may have been born with something wrong with them doesn't mean they are not any different from the rest of us. They may just need people to show them more love, more attetion, and show them that people actually cares about them, and people actually just need just understand them, they are just normal people like the rest of us.
-4	negative	regrets	I sexted the boss.NOW WHAT??? It's crazy. We've has an ongoing affair for 8yrs. The first time I take the initiative, sent some "pics", he says not to send anymore because he's loaning his phone!!!! Guess I need to type up my resignation. What NOW??!!????
-1	negative	regrets	I should have never have gotten married. 
-2	negative	regrets	I should have never said i wanna  now  all i get is boys privats in my inbox NO I DONT Do that anyone   NOW ok and thank you all the adults that warned me that it would go bad im sorry
-7	negative	regrets	I showed some interest in talking to a guy at work..since i cant find anyone to talk to..the other day i added him on facebook today he asked me many questions. i think he might be thinking that i have a crush on him something.i regret talking to him today and answering all these questions..feels akward :$ :$
-2	negative	regrets	I simply regret each past 'relationship' that I have ever had besides the one I am in now. I am so glad that they ended and regret that they even 'existed'. That seems a bit harsh but true.
-1	negative	regrets	Is it bad that I really do wish this? So many things that I could just delete, with a press it would be done and gone forever. No childhood memories of the fights downstairs, the bruises, the move, court, my fathers divorce, or depression, my no-longer step-brother, my first love who i completely lost, DELETE gone for good  but is it worth it to erase?
-2	negative	regrets	I spend too much time thinking of regrets and what I could've done instead.
-1	negative	regrets	Is seriously the worst household chore! Yucky poo
-1	negative	regrets	Is that I'd listened to my intuition, because I always know in my gut what a person is thinking, and feelingand really saying, or hidingSometimes it's hard to trust what you know yourself to be true, in the face of someone telling you something different especially when what you know - you know through your intuition and instict alone but when, through experience, you've found in every instance, to have always been right each time truth has come to light - there's a point where trust in yourself over what a person says to you, is a necessary evolutionary step to take. then you can also take responsibility for your own actions, and your own part in deceiving yourself.
-7	negative	regrets	I still have time left, I guess. But I know I can't do it now. I'm can't bear to. I wish I had a fourth child. I love my three children, but I've always wanted four, and I really want to. I don't know if I can go through with it - if I could cope, I can barely cope if I'm near a newborn, let alone giving birth, reliving so many memories and fears.
-2	negative	regrets	I stole cookies  They were good mmm
-12	negative	regrets	I sure have made some life altering mistakes.. I'm actually gonna loose my husband because of something that should have never happened in the first place I was pleasuring myself and his female cousin walked in and decided she wanted to join in.. I wasn't thinking and started to allow it but then came to my senses very quickly, and stopped.. I thought being honest with him was the way to go but it just made it worse.. I fear he will never trust me and this is the reason for him being abusive towards me now.. I don't blame him for being mad but I tried to explain what happened, and he's just not having it I hate myself for it, and it was never my intention I wasnt seeking it, I have never cheated on him before that incident and I have no desire to repeat my mistake I really really do regret what happened
-4	negative	regrets	It describes me pretty well, I think. I was amazed when I first began reading about INFP. I don't think it's perfect or describes everyone who fits INFP perfectly, but I think it fits me pretty well. I've taken the test several times, and every time the result is the same.
-6	negative	regrets	I think everyone does things that they aren't proud of, but if you learn from those experiences that's all that really matters. If you aren't proud of the choices you make it gives you the power to change!
-7	negative	regrets	I think I concur with many others who feel as if they wish they could start over with someone brand new.  Since my break up almost three months ago, it has been a hard and tedious journey, just to reach the goal of meeting the right woman.   This year, I was very close to my dream of marriage.  However, it wasn't meant to be.  I am hopeful and prayerful that in the coming year or years, my moment will finally arrive, and I will have the love that I have heard so much about from others who have found the love of their life. 
-2	negative	regrets	I think I did now I feel like I played my cards wrong.. & I'm mad and confused! FML
-6	negative	regrets	i think most people have done things they're not proud of.in the past i have cheated girlfriends,done drugs,gotten really drunk,been a rubbish father.just to name a few.you have to put these things behind you,move on & hopefully learn from these experiences.your past is history,forget about it & improve 
-1	negative	regrets	I think one if the things I regret most is cutting myself. Now I have scars everyday on my left arm and their so ugly. They never go away their just there. Not going anywhere..
-8	negative	regrets	It may seem strange that I'm posting this experience in this forum, but it seemed like as appropriate a place as any. Today, I've found purpose and direction. I feel like I'm waking up from some kind of spiritual quiescence. I'm learning to live and love again, but I'm still scared. I'm still uneasy. I know how quickly this life can change. I just don't want it to change. I guess my experiences have weakened me.
-2	negative	regrets	It's been an ongoing on/off nightmare for as long as I've lived, but as of late, my situation has become even worse. 
-1	negative	regrets	It's been a tough couple of months. With the divorce finalizing, the kids starting school, me returning to work. I haven't been working at my studies like I should of. I failed psychology of learning. Bombed. Flunked. I feel terrible.
-18	negative	regrets	#its been happening so often everytime I love a person its always me who ended up broken.there was this man that I tot he can be the ppersonim going to be with for longtimebut I was wronghe just left without saying goodbyeim sick and tired of always being brokenafter they had let me feel that im special and after I love them in return they just dump me like im nothing with them.

-3	negative	regrets	Its been two occassions now that I was sexting guys and others around them had seen my pictures. I was just glad I didn't have my face in them but I still got mad anyways and now I'm gonna stop forever.
-3	negative	regrets	Its just become clear to me I regret every lover I've had. Of which there are a short list. None of them were good enough for me. None of them deserved my affections even a little.
-7	negative	regrets	its other people that mess with evil not me, but it always seems to hang over me ..surrounding melingering through the darkness ..why would these two men torture me so much i have made mistakes of course i have we all have you see ,but it seems i get more of the consequences knocking on my door . you keep making mistakes paulsky and you get away with it and you and your father just keep on hurting me through it,hurt thats hard to remove with only  a damp cloth.its etched in me but it was never my mistake! 
-2	negative	regrets	It's what you learn from your mistakes that is important.
-18	negative	regrets	It was in the fall, we were busy at work transitioning two big contracts from prototype to full on MFG. I had been under the weather for a few weeks, I thought I had pneumonia, but test at the Dr's showed negative. I went to see my Dr. 6 times in 10 weeks. I was getting weaker and having trouble concentrating at work. I decided I needed to get healthy. I was overdue an outpatient surgery for carcinoid tumors in my stomach. I really wanted that one overwith. So I took four days off work. During this week, the office was being remodeled. I kept getting calls to "move your stuff to your new location". I was sick, and weak, so I told my boss to just have my stuff moved to my Lab., and I would take care of it when I got in.
-9	negative	regrets	It was pretty much entirely by choice: I made it impossible for my mother to keep me in school. I hated how alienated I felt there, and decided I'd rather be homeschooled than put up with feeling like a square peg trying to fit through a round hole. When people talk about their experiences with school and with friends, I feel left out. As the subtitle of this group says, it's like there's a void where the memories should be.
-4	negative	regrets	it was the way i was raised you dont raise your fist to a woman ya just dont i dont understand guys like that
-9	negative	regrets	I used to always feel like good and bad days took turns coming throughout the year, but I've learned something that really moved me. I've learned that there are no good or bad days given to us. Each day is the same, and it just depends on how we want live through the day. It's something to really think about
-8	negative	regrets	I used to be a pretty bad drug addict. I used to lie and steal drone everyone around me. Those that have been through it know Addiction changes people.  I stole money from my parents and I'd go missing for days. I'm not proud of much I did in those days. I've been clean for six years now and I'm making a whole lot clearer decisions. 
-6	negative	regrets	I used to cut habitually. I'm so ashamed of my scars because I want to work with youth and feel like that might influence them in unhealthy ways. When I tan in the summer they turn dark and are very visible. Yet I cannot help but be proud that these scars show I have come so far from rock bottom even though things are hard.
-19	negative	regrets	I used to have confidence.  I used to laugh, crack up, be the life of the party! My husband has finally won! He has verbally abused me and has called me every filthy discussing name he can think. Just today he called me every immaniginable  name. This is the only tip! He travels for his job. Withhold all of his business info.  Goes bar hopping. Makes lots of female friends. Drinks and dances until the wee hours of dawn! He goes to prostitutes in China and of course , gets Happy Endings.  Anything I try to do positive with my life , he puts it down! Church , volunteering thru schools. Any thing I try to do that makes me feel good he takes the wind outta my sails.  We are both 53.  I'm not sure why he's so ugly with me. His Mom suffers from Mental Illness and I'm afraid he's acting just like her.  I'm so miserable.  I fantasize about dying everyday. 
-6	negative	regrets	I use to be so shy I refused to talk to anyone I didn't like people. I hated hugging people. I was usually alone. In middle school I spoke a bit except I was still alone. I hate talking to people because I had no idea what to say. But in high school I changed somehow I like hugging people I'm a bit annoying and childish I'm still shy I'm more open now I don't know what happen
-6	negative	regrets	I've always known what I wanted in life. It was something that separated me from people my age. It was something I took pride in; always having a plan and always moving forward, no matter what direction it was. I thought it could happen, i though I could be that special person; the one that will never work a day because they excel at what they do, take pride in what they do, love what they do. Regret is a stone cold b#tch.
-3	negative	regrets	I've attempted suicide and had devastated my two younger sisters; something I wish to never do again. I've been clean from cutting for two years now and still have the scars trailing up my arms and is a constant reminder of how hopeless I used to be. I've become much stronger for myself these two years and will progress to contain my newly kept control.
-4	negative	regrets	I've been single my whole life, not because I wanted to but because no one has ever been interested in dating me. It's caused some really serious problems because not being able to date made me feel like I couldn't be friends with people who date. I've lost friends that way and now I feel like I won't ever date and I don't think I even want to anymore but I still don't think I can ever be friends with people who are dating or married.
-5	negative	regrets	I've been wearing glasses since I was 14 years old. I've been scared of wearing contact lenses (even today), so putting them right on my eyes was not an option. I like wearing glasses though, it helps me see blurry things clearly, obviously.
-4	negative	regrets	I've done so many things im really not proud of. And I know most people would say that. I just feel like I'm the only one who's ever done that kind of stuff.
-1	negative	regrets	I've done some messed up things. I'm going to have to take it to the grave with me. I could never tell anyone not even a stranger on the internet.
-3	negative	regrets	I've done things that have been regretful and have filled me with pain. Every day I wish I could take them back and start all over.
-1	negative	regrets	I've made many mistakes in life  Thanks for reading 
-1	negative	regrets	I've made mistakes. I'm so very sorry for my mistakes. I regret my mistakes. That's my goal 
-4	negative	regrets	I've made my share of mistakes and i still am making mistakes but i'm learning to be better,to not hurt people so much or cut them off for no reason. I'm slowly learning how to be a better person.
-1	negative	regrets	I've ran away.. Now what to do? Guess I'd better return and face the music!
-2	negative	regrets	I've thought of being in a big city, alone at night. Walking through boulevards, with eyes filled with glowing fascination. Appearing as if I am a lost person in a new world, ready to embark an adventure. 
-3	negative	regrets	I walked into my room a few hours ago after being gone all week to find my bearded dragon dead.. I forgot to leave the key with whoever was supposed to take care of her and i never checked my messages to see her asking for it  I hate myself for having made you suffer so much through this I'm so sorry, i already miss you so much I love you
-4	negative	regrets	I want to forget I want to forget everything. I want to start over but I can't. Do I have to live with it for the rest of my life? I don't want to. The pain is crippling me. I can't function.  
-7	negative	regrets	I want to get out of here. Out of my house, city, school, everything. I don't feel like I belong here, and I wish I could just move to a new city and start over. People know things about my past and assume things about me or think I am weak. They think I'm still sick. They think I'm fragile. They see my scars and they run away. They stare. I think if I could get away people would judge me for me, not my past.
-2	negative	regrets	I want to maintain this! Down through the years I have given my love to all I know I maybe hurt sometimes thinking about how they hurt me by not returning the same feeling but it's better than regrets in not giving love
-10	negative	regrets	I was bullied physically and mentally when I was younger. School is supposed to be a safe place for kids to learn and grow with friends, and that's why I think my bullying was the hardest on my mother. She couldn't do anything about the fact that I came home crying everyday. As many calls and visits to the school as she made, nothing ever changed until I left. I'm better now, for the most part. It was a long time ago. That's why I hate bullying.
-7	negative	regrets	I was fired from a job because inappropriate behavior but it all really started because I distanced myself from the crowd.  I unfriended three people from a social media site because seeing their business was starting to hurt me.  I felt like I was saving myself from the temptation of stalking them but they saw if as me being rude and hurtful.   I regret the lost of this one woman who was really there for me and there's nothing I can do to get her friendship back.  She I wish that I could find a way to tell her sorry and that I really wished that we could be friends again.  I really don't think she'd care though.
-8	negative	regrets	I was in a relationship with a guy, and he asked me to send him a picture. Well one wasn't good enough, he wanted to see more and more until I sent him fully explicit pictures of myself. I didn't get any enjoyment out of it, and I'm lucky my parents never found out. He was over 18 and I was a minor, he could've gotten into serious trouble with the law. Sometimes it is hard to say no to somebody, especially if you love them. But you shouldn't do anything you are not comfortable doing. Just learn to say no! 
-5	negative	regrets	I was married for  19 years  but 5 years ago seem to have completely lost the plot had an affair which lost me almost everything . I still don't understand why I was so selfish and stupid and regret it everyday! If only I could stop anyone else making the same mistake ,things tend to spiral out of control and I only wish I could have realised what a big mistake I was making !
-5	negative	regrets	I wasted my mid-20s through mid-30s in a relationship, and eventually, marriage that apparently met no one's needs. One consequence of this is the more than decade-long gap between my kids. It is in the gap, that I feel the almost tangible loss --my missing middle child. A child I never conceived but deeply longed for.  Sometimes, I close my eyes and see my missing middle child. A caramel skinned boy with dandelion fluff hair between the ages of 9 and 14. Sweet, mischievous, daring, funny, spiritual, athletic, and smart like his sisters. We wish each other well. And he is gone again.
-1	negative	regrets	I was telling my mom about this and she started cracking up. But yes I need a sugar daddy.
-10	negative	regrets	I was very little, and like most preschoolers, I was learning the ropes of life. I went to the park with my mom. I lived in a fairly young neighborhood, and when I say that I am talking about the people who inhabited it. That being said the creature I saw in front of me was quite unusual. The was a very tall man standing in front of me,  only his hair seemed to be missing. I laughed and pointed and screamed and probably cried a little. I was screaming at him and at my mom like he was a monster. Now, fast forwarding 10 years, I think back and feel overwhelmingly bad for this man, because he had recently gone through chemo, and I probably made him feel incredibly depressed. When I tell my friends about this we all joke around about how it wasn't that bad, but really this stranger was probably heart broken/ devastated by me and my indecency. I still feel remorse after another 10 years.
-2	negative	regrets	I watch as you stare into my eyes, and I, into yours. 
-12	negative	regrets	I wish for time travel Looking at how unhappy my job is making me i wish to turn back time and go make a decision to change my career take a path since now i have an idea. Back then there was no one to tell me guide me and now-Hail the power of glorious internet i gotta know many things a shy person like me could be good at. (Sigh!) Whats the use i need another life to make it right. I guess my folks ruined me as much as they could from now on anything that goes wrong will be my own responsibility i'm now responsible for myself.
-8	negative	regrets	I wish I could go back in time so badly. Back when we talked all the time. When you were actually intrigued by me. I would go back in time in a heartbeat. I would  chose my words more carefully and become closer to you. But now that we've kissed I messed everything up. I wish I hadn't seemed so needy and pushed you away. I wish you would just understand. I'm afraid if I told you I would just look crazy, or it would be too overwhelming.  I wish you would talk to me again, like we used to.  I just wish I could be with you.But I don't know if it will ever be like that again. 
-4	negative	regrets	I wish I could just talk to someone and say something that I want to say. I'm depressed, and don't know why I just hide it off with a smile. I just feel like I'm a burden to everyone because I'm so weird. I feel ugly, and I know I am, and just feel like uggghh. I used to get bullied all throughout last year because of how I looked now it's not too bad I get comments about me here and there, but it does hurt it repeats in my head all day long sometimes for the whole week.
-2	negative	regrets	I wish i could start over i miss my ex i cry over her ever night even tho she has moved on and its been a year my depression slowly takes over but i dont think i can hold on i wish i could start over do everything over with her agin
-1	negative	regrets	I wish I had known what I know now,then my life would have been quiet different.
-1	negative	regrets	I wish I knew how much this would hurt me too if she found out. Which she did They usually do.  And things have been amazing for the past six months until this weekend when she found out.
-6	negative	regrets	I wish I knew then that my ex was a cheating scumbag who thought he was a player! I would never have wasted 2 years with him if I did. And I wish I knew that my other ex was abusive and mentally wrong in the head. I would've saved so much time and probably would've found my boyfriend sooner and we would've had more time together! 
-4	negative	regrets	I wondered if I would ever be writing my experience in here. I will be removing this story in the due time - which I hope will be within a few weeks at least. 
-1	negative	regrets	I would always feel a sense of shame whenever I remembered. So now I breathe a heavy sigh, It's best not to dwell on this longer than is necessary else I lose myself in the dark corridors of my shame.
-3	negative	regrets	I would give anything to be back with my husband and daughter. I'm sorry for my mistakes but can't find the strength to tell him. Now rumors are he's in bad shape on drugs and I'm the reason he's spinning out of control. 
-11	negative	regrets	I would go back to when I was 17. If I would have truely known that NO MATTER what I did I would never be safe or free I would have lived my entire adult life differently. I wish I would have persued every job opportunity to the fullest. And not kept myself from enjoying every thing I liked doing. I have nothing to regret. I really have lived my life doing what was best for everyone else. I wish I could have had a father figure that I could trust to help me make life changing decisions. Some one with my best intrust in mind. 
-1	negative	regrets	I would have avoided so many stupid situations XD

-7	negative	regrets	I would tell the little girl I was to be brave. I would tell her the beatings won't last forever and one day freedom will be yours. You'll wake up to home that is your own, with no one to make you cower in fear. I'd tell her to to remember to remain fearless and love without holding back.
-2	negative	regrets	I wrote this poem for my darling exwife who has probably contacted the police by now 
-11	negative	regrets	Last week I lost my cat. He was staying at the Vet and had a heart-attack. He was a shy cat and he did not like them, so they gave him an injection to make him relax result was that he died. I had him for 10 years, and he was very special to me :-( I got him just a couple of days after my old cat had to be put to sleep as she was suffering from cancer and for the last 10 years I had only spend 10 nights away from him. I'm sad I took him to the vet, but I had no choice as he was in a lot of pain :-( Life is not the same, and home does not feel like home any-more :-(

-8	negative	regrets	Lord knows I have done things I'm not proud of. Stupid things. I've hurt people, without meaning to. I regret all of those things, But I guess that's why they're regrets. Mistakes. Parts of my past, but that doesn't mean they have to be my future. They made me who I am, the person I choose to be. They helped define me. I'm not a bad person, and of course I'm not perfect. I'm just me another person.. Another heartbeat

-6	negative	regrets	Most perceive me as this sweet little girl that has a constant smile on her face. But if you take the time to get to know me, you'll quickly discover that I can be extremely sarcastic and have a dark sense of humor. I'm usually a super nice and friendly person, so one would never guess the wicked thoughts that cross my mind.
-16	negative	regrets	My 89 year old father passed away on the 6th of September..I can not think of him without tears forming in my eyes.. I loved him so much, he was a wonderful husband to my mother and father to my brothers and I. I feel blessed that we had him with us this long. Anyway, my mother use to tell us the story that she used to work in a drive in restaurant in the 40's as a "carhop" My dad who was in the Navy stopped by and left her a penny tip. He later would tell us that was all he had. I talked to my mother this evening, she is very distraught with missing him. She said that he has come by to see her. He has turned the light on next to her chair when she comes in the house after being away. Today, she found a penny in her bed..Truly, a penny from Heaven for my mother, from the man she loved for 67 years. thank you God for your blessings and for my father's unending love.

I love you, Emily, and I know you are protecting us 
-6	negative	regrets	My boyfriend has it from a motorcycle accident, our motorcycle accident. I think I might have it too but for different reasons. I keep having dreams, once in a while, about my brother that died. I'm not sure why keep having them. it's weird. most of the time I don't think about it. I I did see him die when I was five but when I'm awake I can hardly remember that. I only remember bits and pieces from my experience. Does anyone know why this is?
-3	negative	regrets	My boyfriend usually makes me wait whenever we're going to meetso i let him wait too whenever i go to washroom at malls :D i don't intend to do it, i really am just one of the queens who used to stay long at washrooms and take a bath for as long as 2 hoursminimum of 30 mins as my fastest in which i can only do shampoo my hair and that's all :D if i wash my bodyit would take more than 30 minutes :D (back to my boyfriend) the reason for this is because he will always ask me if i'm in one specific place where he will only go when i get there already. Althoughfor almost 3 years of us being togetherhe's now practicing to be as early as possible. He's considering the traffic, but always late, still!
-11	negative	regrets	my cat Cutu was 8 years old. she was my everything. i never knew how painful losing your best friend would be, until 3 months ago.  i still have such insane guilt. my family thinks im over it but i still cry myself to sleep. i still have super bad days where i just sit and stare and imagine if i didnt feed her that morning, she would still be beside me. i would always say "if she died i dont know what i would do" i really have no idea what to do. im sad, lonley, and feel that if i tell someone all they would do is not care or just give me the "shes much happier up there" when really i pray to god she is because thats whats holding me up. all my friends dont care. i also dont want them to worry. and my family thinks everythings all peachy when really i feel like *. i just hope everything will be ok eventually.

-9	negative	regrets	My dad passed away 11 years ago when I was only 9 years old.  At weird times when I'm either thinking about him or stressed out I'll find pennies in the strangest places.  This morning on the way to take my GRE test for graduate school, I said some prayers and asked my dad to help me have confidence in myself during the test. At the testing center, they give you a locker to put your belongings in. Upon opening mine, I found a penny heads up right in the door of the locker.  Unlike my mother, I have always been skeptical about "pennies from heaven". But this morning after finding my penny from my dad, I found confidence in myself for my test just as I asked him and confidence in the pennies I find truly being from heaven.    
-3	negative	regrets	my Dad passed away on March 12. I have had a really hard time with his passing.4 days after his death death I found 4 pennies ina row in various places. I feel that was him trying to let me know he is OK.
-7	negative	regrets	My dad Verbally abuses my mom, sisters and I. He calls me names. And makes me feel like i'm going insane. I used to self harm and he would make fun of me for it. He hurts me everyday and I just have to shut out his voice when he talks. 
-5	negative	regrets	My first regret is that I should have studied well in schools.I was lazy then and now I am in a lousy job.My second regret I should've taken the risk and pursued a career in some other field.My other regrets include my eating habits,my character.To sum it up I am disappointed in myself for every  choice I made.
-10	negative	regrets	My girlfriend and I were spending the weekend together at my camper down the shore. We had a long day driving four hours to meet her family at the beach to go home and have a break down and a panic attack. We were talking over dinner about my struggles and my disorder. She said,"you make me sad and I cry every night from the fear of losing you that has lately, been consuming me." At that moment through the whole conversation, I wanted to cry. I have become so numb that I rarely cry. That night I ran into the bathroom and repeatedly smashed my head on the mirror as tears streamed down my face creating a puddle of regret on the sink counter. I've never felt so much pain and regret in my life than I did in those moments as I popped more pills and left. 
-9	negative	regrets	My Grandfather just died. I woke up to my alarm today at 8 am. I turned it off and looked at my phone. There was a text from my mother. I opened it to read, "My dad just died. I'm at their house now."  This is a sad morning.
-14	negative	regrets	My husband and i we were looking forward on our 2nd daughter Maricela. I was in labour on september 28 and we headed to the hospital as the nurses checked for the fetal heartbeat they couldn't find it. N we got the worst news in our lives " sorry your baby has passed away ". I had a csection n i prayed that what they told me it was a lie that she would come out crying but no we didn't hear nothing. We decided not to have an autopsy done on her because she was so small and i was full term. Doctors told us there was a problem in my placenta but throughout my pregnancy i was fine no problems. But now she's in a better place while we are here devastated and heartbroken. Maricela C. September 28, 2013
-26	negative	regrets	My husband asked me this morning as he got ready to walk out of the door to go to work, did I want holla box in, referring to our cat Oreo. I responded by saying only if you're going to feed him. I'm not ready to get up yet. He put the food in the bowl and walked outside and began to call Oreo. Usually as soon as we open the door, he's there. Only rarely did we have to call him. He called him about 4 times before he stepped back into the houseand said, 'Oreo got hit.' I asked is he dead? He said yeah. He is laying by the bus stop. The bus stop is directly in front of our house. I immediately felt bad because last night, I'd put him out when he didn't want to go.I scratched his head and felt him purring as I said God night Orie. You've been in the house all day, time for you to go outside. He jumped quickly out of my arms as if he understood. I'll see you in the morning Orie!  I know we've got a long way to go.
-6	negative	regrets	My husband has been using for a long time behind my back but lately it's gotten out of control. He takes all our money, his mood will give you whiplash, he disappears at night in my car with no drivers license. We have 3 beautiful babies together. I've seen too many go down this path, ruin their lives and those around them. I've avoided that life like the plague so how did I end up married to a drug user?? 
-17	negative	regrets	My junior year in highschool I met this girl Sam. She's really pretty, fun to be around and all that. We'd been talking for a couple months and one afternoon she asked me "How would you feel if you got put in the friend zone?". Me being the idiot, i thought she was asking a general question. So i said it wouldn't bother me too much. 2 weeks later I tried to tell her how i felt about her and she told me it was too late because of what i said before. I just graduated high school 2 months ago and it still hurts me to think about it.  She has a boyfriend, she moved on a LONG time ago and I know I should have but I just cant. I feel like the only way to get over the situation is to meet new people but I'm really shy and i just don't know how to solve this.
-6	negative	regrets	My life is not chaotic or bad. I'm not whining about anything, but for some reason I've been filled with wanderlust and I've just been dying to run free again. And I even bought a study book on them. I'm going to use it to avoid being caught while I jump country to country. I don't know when I'm going or even if I'll be going, but I have a feeling it will come in handy when I need it.
-2	negative	regrets	My little angel has passed away this morningShe suffered from A.A Subluxation which was a very rare case in cats. I am devastated, our family decided that it was time for us to let go and not let her suffer any longer as her heart could not tolerate anymore medication   January 28th, 2009 - May 21st, 2013  
-4	negative	regrets	My Mum died when I was 21. She had extensive cancer but unfortunately both my parents kept her condition from me and my Sister, so I never really had time to prepare. My Wife always got on well with Mum, but her and my Dad just didn't see eye-to-eye, so over the years, we've kind of grown apart. I never got to tell Mum how much I loved her and appreciated her, and I will regret that for the rest of my life. I miss her every day.

-13	negative	regrets	My plan for the day was to pay my VIP angel card bill and to use my Angel reward  for a free cotton hiphugger. After my shower I chose a red silk thong to wear under my mid-rise straight leg jeans and a waist length linen loose button down shirt. I arrived at VS a bit after 3PM and there were only a few shoppers, mostly college aged young ladies. I asked a sales associate which panties were eligible for the free panty offer and she showed me where to to find them. On the way to the display the 5 for 26 offer caught my eye so after I selected my free hiphugger I then selected 2 bikini, 1 string bikini, 1 thong and a V-string to add to growing panty drawer. I love Victoria's Secret for the numerous free panties and cash rewards they have given me under the Angel rewards program.
-24	negative	regrets	My sister was sleeping over and we decided to go for a walk, my dad and uncle were standing around the ute, I went over to talk to them and as I got there my uncle said "So Vincent Maloney died of cancer" I went back to the house and inboxed my friend who also knew him and told her, she already knew. I wanted to cry and scream but not in front of my best friend. She left that afternoon and I stayed up all night silently crying, I didn't sleep at all.  That Friday was the funeral and I decided not to go because I was too upset, I wanted to go to the graveyard and pay my respects on my own. I walked past the funeral service on my way to the hairdressers after school and I nearly started crying but I didn't. After the hairdressers I went back to my friends place and dad picked me up from there to take me home after he left the funeral, he gave me the pamphlet and it had his face on it, I had never felt so sick in my life, I still have the pamphlet after 6 months

Don't bring me your baggage, because I have my own, and I manage it wellmost of the time. Life is short so my advice, learn to be happy. That comes from inside.

-2	negative	regrets	Okay  I got home from a day out in the city and my mum gathered her things to go out and get something that she was suppose to get the previous day. She notices that $50 way missing from her jacket pocket. Immediately she looked at and blamed me due to me being the only one surrounded by shops on the day. I got extremely angry at her and refused to eat dinner that night in protest. Was that the right thing for me to do?
-2	negative	regrets	Ok so please bare with me, i will try an explain this as much as i can. To me this is confusing and i dont know how. I am not stupid could there have been  technical fault. Or has he just played me?
-8	negative	regrets	Once upon a time a man and a woman had two kids and on the second child they decided they would stop there so she got a tubal ligation. The couple's marriage started going all wrong so they decided to get a divorce. The woman met someone else she could be happy with and they wanted a baby together but couldn't because she had gotten her tubes tied and now she regrets it. End of story. 
-8	negative	regrets	One day, a stray cat showed up at our garage door, he was mostly black with a white patch on his back, so I called him Midnight. We couldn't take him in because my dad hates cats. But my mom and I still fed him  and eventually he let me pick him up, I would pick him up and pet him and hug him everytime I saw him. July 4th, 2012 was the last time I saw my precious little kitty and after that I never saw him again, he might still be alive, but I still haven't seen him yet. I wrote a memorial service for Midnight the cat and I miss him so muuuuuch. D'X (I'm sobbing loudly as I type this)
-5	negative	regrets	One of the hardest things to deal with when trying to overcome panic and anxiety is knowing what to do with all that excess energy. I know when I used to get my panic attacks it sometimes felt like I just wanted to jump right out of my skin! My heart would race at a thousand beats per minute and I thought one day it just might literally shoot out of my chest. Of course my hypochondria only made it worse because I was convinced I could have a heart attack at any moment. 
-4	negative	regrets	On my drive to the job I now hate I think about just driving past and not stopping.  Wondering how long before anyone notices I am gone.  My kids would wait a day or two - they don't talk to me unless they want something.  I spend so much time in meetings it would be days before anyone at the office missed memaybe weeks.   I spend night after night after night alone now.  Might as well be in a new place and start over.
-5	negative	regrets	Or rather I was brunette, but I'm more salt and pepper on top. Oh I was a light brown colour when I was small but then it got dark.  I remember a time when I was bare armed and it was snowing outside, the sun was low in the sky and it caught the hairs on my arm and they turned into rainbow hairs.
-5	negative	regrets	Past is pastbut if you look at how I do things, you'll knowsometimes it's in my eyes, sometimes it's in the way I handle things.  Things have happened that I'd rather undobut what's done is done.
-10	negative	regrets	People follow a strict series of protocols and procedures when interacting, and i HATE those protocols, it means i have to listen to trivialities before having a real conversation, and get stuck when i have to leave, i have to listen to things i dont care about, have to wait whilst others talk etc. I am not great with the protocol, i know the protocol, but where others navigate it, i stumble along, so i often miss avenues that others go through.
-2	negative	regrets	Pet peeves in this area: 2 - People who tell me to be more assertive - but then get all bent out of shape when I'm assertive with THEM.

-1	negative	regrets	Pretty sure every human being annoys me in some way. Hahah Maybe not that intense but I'm definitely annoyed easily.
-4	negative	regrets	Question: Of course putting your fears in perspective is only part of the solution. A very big part, but it's still very important to know what exactly is going on in your body during a panic attack as well as learning to turn that rush of adrenaline into something enjoyable. I've created a video on my youtube channel, and it's also on my site, you may want to check it out and hopefully it helps you overcome your temporary limitations. Not sure if I can post links on this forum but its (Live-Panic-Free) followed by Dot com. Thanks for stopping by my site.
-5	negative	regrets	Rarely is it ever the case that that any of us willingly abandon a friend. Usually it is a case of either time or distance splitting you apart after a while or perhaps it is changes. At any rate when forced recently to cut a YoungBlood adrift, I realized that it had been the one of the three that seemed to matter the least. The other two were trainwrecks by my own admission. Yes I do admit on both of our parts - Etain and Morrigan that we might have been generous with the current losses but mercy is a virtue we aspire to rather than sneer at. Do we mourn those lost? Absolutely but it is understood that at times we must lose some or endanger our own wellbeing in the process.
-3	negative	regrets	Recently my grandmother passed away, it was reminder that life on this Earth is not forever, cherish the ones you love while you can today, because tomorrow might be too late There they will always be the same.
-2	negative	regrets	Regrets collect like old friends   It's always darkest before the dawn
-1	negative	regrets	Regrets? I have a few. They've cost me greatly, but recently things have been getting better. I'm happy for what's happening but at the same time it makes me nervous. Happiness doesn't usually last long for me, something always seems to go wrong. I will keep a positive attitude, I don't want to sabotage anything.
-6	negative	regrets	Regrets. Thinking about just how many regrets I have is enough to give me a headache. Going back in time in my mind and thinking about just how many times I wish I could have done things different. Always thinking what if I had done different things maybe things in my life could be a lot better. I can honestly say that with all the regrets that I have it makes it hard for me to move forward with my life. But I can't stay in that mindset. The only way to make things better is to let go of what was and move to what could be. Moving forward is a very scary thing but who knows it might be the best thing I could ever do. 
-3	negative	regrets	Relationships: They terrify me. Which is probably why I haven't been in one for so long. I try letting people in but they always end up disappointing me in one way or another. Each time I let the walls down someone comes along and forces me to put them back up. I don't know the idea of letting someone in and them leaving is enough for me to not even want try againalthough I don't like being alone, I sometimes do think I'm better by myself.  
-1	negative	regrets	Sam was the best cat ever. He was hit by a car yesterday morning. I can't stop crying. I keep expecting him to be at the door or on the porch. He was 10 years old in April. Taken from me way too soon. My heart is broken. I can't sleep. He had such a wonderful personality. He was funny and silly. I hate using the words "was" and "had". I want to hold him again and have him hug me and nuzzle my face. I love you Sam. Life will not be the same without you. I can't believe you are gone. You were created just for me. You were perfect! Love you forever. 
-6	negative	regrets	Saying they are interested, they really want to know me and its okay whatever it is cause they will still accept me then Okay when i confess the truth about what i am, they dont like anymore. See, now i know who is true and really want to be my friend. I dont see any wrong to be holy! So they want me to live normal doing sin in moral?.
-1	negative	regrets	School was a torment for me. I wasn't popular - I was overweight - Wore glasses - Had acne - Enjoyed studying - Wasn't into sports - Didn't fit into any particular group - Was from the wrong side of the tracks - Came from an insane family Moral to the story? Don't bully! Treat others as you would like them to treat you - cuz ya never know when that person just might be in a position to exact revenge. It's better to "kill em with kindness" and ensure you never have to wonder
-7	negative	regrets	She says she's fine, but she's going insane, She says she's okay, but really she's not

Everything. She was my other half.. My shoulder to cry on.. Then her boyfriend came along and she cared about him more and claimed I didn't care about her going to the hospital.. I hurt every night.. I can't listen to any of the music we used to listen to.. I miss you so much
-2	negative	regrets	shoulda, coulda, woulda. those are all bunk for people who want to make their mistakes into regrets. if i shoulda done something else, or a i coulda, i woulda. its better to learn from your mistakes and often its not too late even to fix mistakes before they turn into regrets.
-2	negative	regrets	Sigh I'm alone tonight Haven't felt like this in awhile. Can someone  tell a joke or something???!!!!
-4	negative	regrets	Simple things, like not talking to a friend when they need it and just listening to them say they're fine. When it's really obvious they're not. Or when someone I know is going through a hard time, and I don't do anything because I'm not really they're friend. I just think, it wouldn't really help because they don't really know me, and I don't know them. But it makes me feel really guilty because their real friends can't see that they're obviously hurting and I can, but I'm so bad with words that I'll probably just make it worse. I wish I could be that person that, when they see someone sitting alone, they will go over and become friends. I wish I could be like that, but I'm sort of socially awkward and I just think that we will end up sitting in uncomfortable silence anyway and I wouldn't be helping.
-2	negative	regrets	Since I got alopecia, I spend alot of time on my own or at work. I feel like i dont fit in with my friends and family anymore. Dont get me wrong i have lovely friends and family. They start to feel sorry for me when i start to talk about what really bugs me and how i feel about my alopecia. Also i feel talking about how i feel is depressing cause i always end up talking about the disease i have! I dont mean too it just comes out. Thats why i choose to work more as this way i dont have time to think about myself. Im a nurse, i love looking after other people, i lose myself in looking after other people.
-2	negative	regrets	Since leaving the Marines,i find it difficult to sleep.The Dr's wont give me anything.So i have to rely on dealers.I get tamazipan,for relaxing and helping me doze off.Then Amphetimine to wake me up.Not everyday.Just when i need it.
-3	negative	regrets	Sin never gives what it promises 2 bestow. and costs us more than we intended 2 pay..
-11	negative	regrets	So, basically, there was a guy who I really liked a year and a half ago, we had both experienced break ups & ended up sleeping together. Then it got complicated Or talk to me. I get so angry (to the point if shaking) that I want to slap him or give him a piece of my mind or something, but then the last time I saw him (which was a few weeks ago) I blushed and started giggling, yet when he clocked me, he spent the rest of the time giving me evils. I mean Wtf?! It winds me up that he can't even be civil and, quite frankly, i do regret it as we got on well prior to sleeping together.
-10	negative	regrets	So I have been extremely unhappy lately and yesterday i got so angry with someone i love that i finally decided to just run..just not very far.  I went to the bank, took out money I didn't have, hopped on the train that i can walk to and went to Boston for the evening; not even over night. I was so angry and was having horrible panic attacks.  Although I had a good time (did nothing crazier than eat sushi and then sit in south station writing in my journal with a tea), I just had to come back.  And I'm realizing that really I can't run away from my own brain; which is the thing that causes me so much pain.  So I'm back, with less money, maybe a nice memory for some time with myself but really.it didnt do too much. If i actually legit ran away to another country like I'd love to do, I realize i'd just hurt my family and still be stuck with my own brain.  But maybe for a week. :-)
-3	negative	regrets	So i really love getting drunk on the weekends and it seems as if i can never control myself when i do. I can never reach that perfect amount of drunkness and just go straight to wasted. I always make a fool of my self, just saying things I dont mean, or want anyone to know. Also i always end up hooking up with guys who are never mature enough to let it go and leave me alone about when i do sober up!
-12	negative	regrets	so I spoke to my dad the other day about getting a gastric sleeve surgery. I've been nervous for days, i knew my dad was extremely supportive and would'nt mind it. So my friend introduced the idea to me last week, and for the past 7 days i have been doing extensive research on VSG and to conclude what i have learnt! I can tell its positive, alot of people do it and it actually works!! so tomorrow is my appointment i'm a little nervous but mostly excited!  so a little background on myself, im turning 23 next month.. i have hypothyroidism for almost 8 years of my life, i've been through several yoyo diets in my life! my highest and current weight is 286 Pounds, my height is 5.47.my target weight is 170 pounds! because i was 170 a few years back and it looked and felt great! anyway.. i'll be posting my progress from time to time.
-1	negative	regrets	so long as the no paradox effect. I go back get me and rasie me now.lol
-7	negative	regrets	So many of you are breaking up with your MMs so I thought I'd offer a couple of good songs for what is surely a hard time for you. Chin up, girls! Love to you all! I love these songs anyway, but I think they could be helpful in a breakup situation. 
-9	negative	regrets	So me and my ex-roommate is not talking anymore because basically she's to close-minded, two-faced, and just in PERIOD A BITCH!!! The biggest regret that I have is that I'm not telling my friends why I'm not talking to her they would figure it out soon anyway; but they are all trying to figure it out, asking my other friends, why won't they ask me..instead they are comforting her and now I look like the bad personEffing Great because apparently I was her "best friend". 
-13	negative	regrets	Some day as you grow and stop living your life as others think you should I hope you can look back and understand what's actually happened here. When you realize the things you never thought of and finally see what I was saying, I hope you can find peace with yourself and me and can deal better with the things you can't change. That will be the day you will think of me again with a smile instead of the frown. I never did this to be mean, you will see. I don't have to be there for your rush of truth in your life, i was there to deal with the lies. and i was also here to let know that day is on its way.
-2	negative	regrets	Some kids carry on like a baby, just about every time I go to a shop there seems to be a kid screaming and yelling and I'm getting sick of it, I feel liked going up to the parent and say: "Control your child!" But it's really annoying but I know I can't do anything to the kid. Arrrr just so god dam annoying.
-2	negative	regrets	Someone please help me I'm trying to get clean but I'm miserable
-4	negative	regrets	Sometimes i beleive from myself that i passed trought the madness and i survived,now i believe that crazy is crazy and there are not pills for this madness.
-3	negative	regrets	Sometimes I imagine going back and telling myself everything, like what's going to come on a test, how to avoid embarrassing situations and such
-2	negative	regrets	Sometimes I think just hopping a freight train and going wherever it took me might be a really great idea.
-3	negative	regrets	Sometimes I think that I'm better off alone. I'm infatuated of the thought of being with someone, being loved. The feeling of being alone makes me cringe, yet I'm always alone.
-3	negative	regrets	Sometimes i wish i could leave everything behind n run away 2 a peaceful place where its free frm assignments n reports hahahaha..
-1	negative	regrets	So much thoughts on my mind, but when it comes down to it I can't find the right words to let it out exactly how I feel it. I'm not usually one to type how I feel on my phone but I hope it helps.   hope anyone who reads this has an amazing day.
-11	negative	regrets	So my brother and I started a podcast called "Life According to Brothers" and talk about our life experiences, how we got through them, and what we've learned. My brother is the funny one and I anchor the show down and try to keep it semi-serious. I think the contrast between out personalities works well. He breaks out into song at times and I come back with witty remarks. But we always have a good time and look forward to answering questions and meeting new people who have had some great experiences.
-7	negative	regrets	So, my story today is really just a normal story for most teens now anyways, it's not really any different from what you hear from a girl that looks sort of like me I cut. Not a lot and not deep. But I do, and it's getting worse everytime I do it and I don't want it to go to far but it's already getting far enough. I used to think "I'm ugly so why would it matter if another part of my body that was once pretty be ugly with the rest of me." and also something like "I don't like who I am and who I am forced to be around, so let me bleed out a few times. Maybe just one or two more."  I'm trying my hardest to forget all the hurtful things people did to me back then and all the things that stick in the back of my mind that just left scars on my arms. I wish I knew it was a bad idea back then like I know it is now
-3	negative	regrets	Soooo tired. I work 7 days a week trying to get ends to meet and i just want a break.  at least some different people to talk to if nothing else
-6	negative	regrets	Sophie was diagnosed aged eight. Just over ten months later, she went into a coma as a result of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. We turned off the ventilator two days later. She was eight years, eleven months at her death, and she will forever be my wonderful, brave little girl who I love so much but can never hold again. I love you, Soph, my beautiful child. Not in my arms, but in my heart, always.
-1	negative	regrets	"So we all have something store in our memory banks of the past that we wish we could have done differently , or something we  wish we didn't do." Just make sure to learn from past mistakes , forgive yourself and move on"
-4	negative	regrets	Tear after tear and a bit more of pain trying to find comfort and once again failed. such a big void in my heart Im afraid to love again the hurt the confusion will you be there for me? I asked him he said yes but today i'm alone  and im telling him "you left" now here I am wishing I could overcome this pain 
-3	negative	regrets	Tell me, doctor, where are we going this time Get back, get back
-1	negative	regrets	Thats my dog name .She was a street dog and we took her in clean her up and made friends.I miss her the day she pass away i was not home my brother in law ran over her a night .He didnot see her .They try to get her away but i did not see her the next morning .So my daddy told me what had happen.I still miss her she was a good dog
-1	negative	regrets	That's okay. I am always told I look young for my age
-3	negative	regrets	The best thing about mistakes is that know one can truthfully say they don't make mistakes because without mistakes we would be perfect and know one is perfect because perfect never had a true definition to applying to human beings.
-4	negative	regrets	The days go by so fast now and i spend most of them doing nothing. i'm just throwing time out the window that i'll never get back. Time goes by so fast i barely even notice until the end of the day. Another 24 hours wasted. I never really worried about time before but now it seems like it's the most important thing in the world
-11	negative	regrets	The feel of his body next to mine as he starts to play bob seager accompany me, the song he has saved for the one woman that he would live forever and he grabbed me around my waist, dancing slow with me in his arms and singing the words so softly but my heart heard them. I can still see our little kitchen in Ashland a slum for a college preppie town bu it was ours. I can smell dinner in the air I can see his eyes as his looked into mine and the world disappeared..  If I could just relive that moment I would be happy for the rest of my life
-8	negative	regrets	The first regret I have involves the only guy I may have loved. I spent 13 years with the wrong guy, when I only wanted him all along. I regret  putting off Nursing school to take care of a mother in law who never did anything but stab me in the back. I regret hurricane Sandy. Not much I did to cause that. I lost someone because they had to go there longterm for the clean up. I would have loved for that to work out. He was very special. 
-9	negative	regrets	The last few times I shopped at VS, I went there with my gf and her bff. Whenever I go with them, I wear a full set lingerie and women's clothes. That day we went to the mall, I was wearing a black tank top with slightly transparent jacket/sweater or whatever you call it, paired with a short pants, and a pair of 4" wedges.  I got pretty comfortable wandering around at the mall and after that, I go to mall whenever I like to go with my growing collection of women's clothes.!!!
-2	negative	regrets	The latest official release version of myself is pilotbob7.5 but 8.0 is still in beta testing.
-14	negative	regrets	The memories, they haunt me everyday. They manifest and become something so real. Like a ghost, that visits me everyday, and reminds me of the things you've said, your smile, that gleam in your eye, and your faithless promises. I should have known. I should have listened to that gut feeling, like something was just wrong, something was missing. A blindness feeling, not being able to see it, but to feel it. Like a cold chill creeping up your spine. Your smile was fake, as if you were wearing it on your sleeve. Your words were dull, so distant in heart. I should have known darling, but I didn't. I never gave up on you, and it's kind of ironic, that even though your a fiend and a liar, I still haven't given up on you. My intentions we pure at heart, but yours were fake, like a one way mirror. I should have known.
-2	negative	regrets	The more I saw you, the more I fell for you. I don't know why I make  things so complex and overthink things, but you make me forget about everything when I talk to you. You make me sad when we depart and smile when you look at me. I don't know how to describe this, but don't leave though; you're intriguing me. You're the only person I don't feel awkward with talking about anything; I feel welcomed and comforted by you. And after all this, I still refuse to say that I like you.  I'm so idiotic, indecisive, pathetic and weak; you make me feel like all the opposite.
-1	negative	regrets	The only real mistake anyone can make I when you fail to try your best. Other than that there are no mistakes, but rather learning experiences
-5	negative	regrets	The only reason I want to be rich is so that I can have a home of my own and so that could be able to live and not worry about bills. It would also be nice to help my parents and brother. Someday I hope to call myself rich and live a life right now I can only dream of
-7	negative	regrets	there is a lot of things i regret .. i regret going to that college out town , although i always try to show to the others that i`m proud of it and i like that choice i made ,but deep inside me i know that i should have stayed and joined the college in my town , it would have been so much better . if i could go back in time , i might be able to change all of that . but i know that i can`t ,,
-3	negative	regrets	There is too much to me. I am a sophisticated person who believes that I don't know myself well enough, and that I need someone who understand me from the heart to tell me who I am. Until then, I'm a stranger to myself, putting up with myself until she comes along 
-4	negative	regrets	There's a difference between finding a guy and finding the right guy. If I wanted to be in a relationship, I'd be in one.
-12	negative	regrets	These 'mansonto' type companies are thugs in a suit! They use tax payers money to implement law inforcement to use gastapo tactics on family owned farmers!!! They disgust me!!!! Share this with your friends. If I hadn't seen it with my own eyes, I'd say,'Not in the USA! There's no way they  could get away with that! You have a right to know what they are doing with our food supply.
-6	negative	regrets	The things that I have done has built me into the person I am today. I have a lot of regrets from my past, but there is no way that I could fix it even if I tried. There's so many people I have hurt & so many bad actions that I still pay for everyday. I try to do the right thing every day, but sometimes my plan downfalls. All I can really do is forgive myself & try even harder.
-3	negative	regrets	They said they would be there for me forever. They lied again.
-4	negative	regrets	Things happened in the past, words said to me, deeds did on me, people pass by me, fights and arguments I had, staff I did I wish I wasn't there, I wish I didn't do these crap. If I could rub these memories out of my head. Maybe sometimes the best solution is not confronting the situation, because it could make things so much worse. Here I am ran away to another country, and everything is working out great. I wish I could've done it earlier.
-13	negative	regrets	This has always bothered me from the day that it happened. When I was 15 I was struggling really bad with depression and at one point it got to be too much So then I was stupid enough to try to end it. I grabbed some pills from the bathroom mirror and took them. After realizing what I was doing I made myself throw them up. I was disgusted with myself and just throughout of myself as terribly weak. I was terrified about what I've done and I haven't really told anyone. I can't keep that bottled up anymore.  From that moment I had a new outlook on life. Sure the depression comes back now and then but I promised myself that I will never sink that low again. Now I try to think about the people that I'd ever leave behind if that happened and all the people that I've helped who would've never known me and it just gives me new hope
-5	negative	regrets	This hurts me bc I have a cousin who is only 10 years old and is disabled/ autistic(I'm sorry if they're not the same idk) but I would really help them and keep them happy.
-4	negative	regrets	This is a good point to make for tonight.. I'm sitting here basically alone, (even tho he is sitting across from me) drinking some wine and sitting in silence and being ignored.. Any attempt on my part to strike up conversation just ends with him being ignorant.. Telling me to move out and calling me names.. I just wish he would make the first move and file for divorce Already.. If he doesn't want to be with me then what's the hold up.. If I had money of my own I think I'd of filed already I just don't know why I keep trying to hold on to someone who obliviously doesn't want me anymore.. But he won't leave and would rather make me and the kids suffer.. UGHHH
-2	negative	regrets	This is a long story, but i have had this on my chest for 1 year, and i need to get it out, so weather or not your prepared to read it is up to you.
-8	negative	regrets	This is going to be short and simple. I am a mutt, like EVERYONE in America. However, I am a Black Woman. When people ask me, 'What are you?', I look at them with a very catatonic look and ask them, "If I were to answer your question, would it please you? Would you treat me differently? If I gave you a certain answer, would you treat me accordingly to whatever race I give you?' It is really offensive to ask people this question. I am a person, at the end of the dayjust like you. 
-18	negative	regrets	This is how I want to help others (and at the same time help myself). I will be interviewing people in my community for the podcast. The purpose of the interview is to help people that are struggling with issues realize that they are not alone and craziness happens. People that have experienced discomfort in their lives, made mistakes, or are struggling with a mental illness, such as depression, anxiety and PTSD have a hard time talking about their experiences because they are embarrassed and the majority of society isnt open to these types of subjects. Sharing your unique story can show a person that its ok to talk about your experiences and that could help lift a heavy burden off their chest. It may help them seek help and support that they need in order to get better. It shows that despite bumps in the road they can be survivors and help others through their experiences.
-10	negative	regrets	This may not seem like an extreme addiction, but there are la All I can say is, I feel like we're on two different worlds.  I love him, but he's turning out to not be the man I thought he would be when it came time to grow up, get job so I can take a break from being the only one making enough money to pay the bills, and prepare for parenthood.  He doesn't want to grow with me.  He's content on his couch with his laptop, x-box, and bag of weed.  And he's almost 30 years old.  He's never going to change, and I don't know how to tell him that he's worrying me about how reliable he'll be as a husband and parent in the future.  
-6	negative	regrets	This Mistake Is By Far The Worst I've made many mistakes throughout my life, but recently, I've made the biggest mistake I've ever made. I hurt someone I care about dearly, and I'm afraid they hate me now. I really messed up this time. by trying to protect myself from more heartache, I ended up hurting the person I care about most. I'm hoping I'll get another chance to fix it before the damage is permanent. 
-2	negative	regrets	Those 5 years at school were some if the worst. But its been 3 years so I guess I am moving on
-1	negative	regrets	Thoughts and feelings really can change someone whole life . In a good way or bad .
-8	negative	regrets	Throughout my life I have made nothing but wrong choices. Most of the choices I made had everything to do with me wearing my emotions on my sleeves. I never took the time to think about the things I was doing. I let things get so bad I never let myself think I could have any kind of a future. I never let myself have true dreams and goals. It's a struggle everyday to not stay stuck in that mindset but I know now I don't what things to be like this anymore. I'm ready to chase goals and dreams. I'm ready to not let fear get in my way anymore. I want to think about my future and build the life I am happy to live.
-7	negative	regrets	To be honest, my biggest regret is how addicted I became to touching myself and well you know. It became a disgusting part of my life and only recently have I started to fight back on the addiction, I'm trying to clean up my profile as we speak. I need to be a cleaner guy so I can be a happier person inside.
-4	negative	regrets	today I lost my best friend, a beautiful English Labrador,  we were blessed to have had him for 11 yrs,  he has not been well for the past week, as he was in older dog, I knew that his time was coming, he was ok yesterday but during the evening hours he started going down very fast, this morning we were planning to have him put to sleep, but he just died early this morning.old friend I just want to thank you for being the best dogI am going to miss you sunny sunshine.till we meet again buddy, till then you will be in our thoughts and heartsmika
-1	negative	regrets	Today is one of the hard days. Everyday has been up and down since my boyfriend Joe died 2 months ago in a car crash. I just woke up with no real motivation. Just laid in bed with his pillow re reading text conversations. He was so special i truely feel he was my one and only soulmate. I need him back I hate this life with out him.
-2	negative	regrets	Today once I came back from the store with yet another unneeded purchase and seeing the look in my husbands eyes was a wake up call that I need to admit I have a compulsive habit.  I realize I need to stop this now as it can totally destroy my family but don't know how to curb it. Where do I begin and why is it so hard for me to just be able to not buy everything I see that I like.
-6	negative	regrets	Today was a great day.  First it was my child's birthday.  I can't believe how he is growing up.  So crazy.  They grow up so fast. I am madly in love with this man, and I am enjoying it.
-2	negative	regrets	To fix all my mistakes, & do what I should've done and could've but never did. They say YOLO (you only live once), that means u have one shot at making it right the first time. Don't waste time doing stuff u regret. Though memories do last forever
-8	negative	regrets	War, hunger, heartache, personal trauma, pleasure, love, these are all things we face as human beings. These are things that drive us apart and bring us together. The very fiber that makes, or breaks us so to speak.    I  marvel at us, as humans. I find wonder and amazement and hope, that despite the obvious despairity in this fight, we do not give up. We will repeat these mistakes until finally somehow, someday, we finally do learn from them. I dare not ask when that will be!
-7	negative	regrets	was leaving behind a woman I truly loved for a job. &nbsp;I really thought she would follow me, but she didn't, and I don't blame her because I handled it badly. &nbsp;Now four years have passed, I'm 40, and I'm all alone and still miss her terribly, but she has moved on, and she's the only one for me. &nbsp;All I have is this job, which isn't all it was cracked up to be anyway. &nbsp;After all, it's not like I didn't have a job before. &nbsp;And I can never go back, because it's all the way across the country and what I do is very specialized, and there simply are no jobs in this field (which is one of the reasons why I took this job in the first place).
-5	negative	regrets	We all make mistakes some big and some small. I bet not one person can truly say that they have not ever made a mistake in their lives. I am one of those people who can put their hand up and admit they have, a lot. 
-4	negative	regrets	Well in truth, lots of mistakes. But the one I am typing about is about my Birthday. Things went badoddly enough just before I was about to tell her I wanted to celebrate my birthday with her.I wanted a Birthday cake..so again now, no Birthday this year.
-3	negative	regrets	Well i've done quite a few things i'm not proud of and i'll never will be. Some of it might be things people think are just horrible. But i'm improving. I'm not that person anymore.  Yeah, i guess i'm human like everyone else.
-4	negative	regrets	Well, thank God I've never witnessed this first hand, but I have seen results. Take a look at some of our homeless, and you'll see what I mean.
-1	negative	regrets	went to the dentist my right side is starting to lose the freezing  feel like i have a rubber mask on
-3	negative	regrets	We're a runaway group looking for anyone else who may want to meet us in Cali. We have 13 and could always use more so please message me for more details thanks!  
-1	negative	regrets	What else can I say but, yeah, I've done thing I'm not proud of, but I don't tell people about them on a whim.
-14	negative	regrets	What happens when being different around others becomes a daily routine? I feel as if I have to be different when I'm around a different group of people. When I am at school I act confident, together and cool.. When really I am just happy to be accepted by a group of people instead of hated. When I am home and at work.. I have to be more to myself, because honestly .. no one cares enough to think about the type of person I truly am. I make sure to get into anyone's way. If I meet you for the first time, the way you bring yourself determines how my personality will be. My personality differs. My true personality is something nobody will really see.. Unless they want to actually know me, that is.
-5	negative	regrets	What if your bully tells you that he bullied you to try to stop his feelings towards you ? What if your bully actually loves you ? What if you used to love your bully ? What would you do ? Would you forgive the person ? I'm lost.
-11	negative	regrets	What my life would be like had my father not died when I was ten. Even though my parents divorced when I was a baby, he would sill come and get me every weekend. My mom got re-married when I was ten and was verbally abused by my old stepfather. I think I would or might have gone to live with him (at least would have demanded to); nonetheless, I certainly wouldn't have had to be around my old stepfather every day of the week. I was I could know as maybe life would have been or be better.
-17	negative	regrets	What's been done I can't change. The only thing I can do is fix what's going on now. I have to really reflect on myself and have a vision of where I'm going. How am I going to get there? There's things I used to do, many bad habits (still have some) but I've really tried to quit them. Since I got into a church that preaches the truth a couple of years ago I've tried to stop sinning. I will read about sins in the bible and make a conscious effort to avoid falling into them. I still see myself in a persistent battle some days extremely bad other days are moderate. I'm very critical of my mistakes and I can be very harsh on myself. I look at my failures and it beats at my self-esteem. God and pastors have been clearly my best answer to peace with myself thus far. I can't fix the past God forgave me of my repented past mistakes and He also see's me for what I CAN be instead of what I'm not. I want to feel better God's working and I'm a living example of it.
-1	negative	regrets	What's the difference between a regret and a mistake?
-1	negative	regrets	when i never got any response nor explanation. so we are done 
-2	negative	regrets	When I told my husband I was pregnant in May 2012, with his child no doubt, he proceeded to cry and tell at me as if it was all my fault He did not want another child. The fear of what might happen if I stood up for what I wanted paralyzed meJuly 5 2013 we aborted. Since then nothing has been the same, every second of every day is filled with resentment, hate and sorrow.
-3	negative	regrets	When I was 12, I told my grandmother that I hated her dog and that her egg salad was gross. She never recovered.  
-4	negative	regrets	When I was a boy my father use to call me lots of names, when he wasn't beating me with his slipper. One name was the most hurtful, and that name was "RETARDED"
-4	negative	regrets	When I was school I really loved drama, debating and acting. I was so excited the possibilities of my life and all the great fun things I would do in it. Well none of that came to fruition.  I have always lacked self confidence and when it came to the crunch, I didn't have the courage to pursue my dreams. I really got off track, just partying, using drugs,wasting my time and life.  Now I'm forty three, working in a nothing job.  Social life left with last boyfriend.  I work night shifts so it seems impossible to go and do social things.  I go overseas when I can, but I do it alone.  I'm scared things won't change. I don't know how to change them.
-5	negative	regrets	When I was younger I did really bad things.     I wish I could go back to when I turned 14 and just start over from there But as I'm growing up I've learned to learn from all the mistakes I've made. I'm just so happy with who I am right now and I hate looking back at how I used to be I'm just going to keep moving forward and block out my past.
-3	negative	regrets	When was the last time you loved someone that time didn't matter? I wish you knew.
-5	negative	regrets	When would I have said "stop"? The answer is never. She had the guts and still I'm unable to agree with her in the decision. I can't tell if I'm being self-destructive in wanting her back and perhaps idealising the past. I ended up with anxiety, stress, sorrow and in an ambulance and still if she called me up and asked if I wanted to get back togetherI'd say yes in a heartbeat.
-1	negative	regrets	Where there are no walmarts
-2	negative	regrets	Who brought up having an affair first?  Was it a mutual thing, kinda falling into a kiss etc.  Or did you talk about it before doing anything. 
-4	negative	regrets	Who hasn't?  I am currently living with a huge mistake that I have made recently. It had to do with one of my really good friends and I pray that he will forgive me someday.. I don't know what the future will bring, but I know I will make plenty of more mistakes throughout my lifetime. It's kind of what life is all about. 
-1	negative	regrets	Who hasn't ? Perfection shouldn't even be considered a word .
-2	negative	regrets	Why do we get scared?    I will not listen to myself so late at night ever again. Because apparently, when I can't sleep at night overthinking things, I am my own worst enemy.
-6	negative	regrets	Wish someone would have mentioned these fact to me when I was a child. It would have at the very least opened my eyes to the kind of organization the LDS fonder had created and the reasons behind some of the twisted lies they are still using to this day. 
-5	negative	regrets	yeah well not exactly cos I really try not to regret stuff or look in to the past with what ifs. It's all part of the fun - the learning curve. But yep, i've changed a lot. All upwards from here!
-3	negative	regrets	Yea I'm pretty hard to get to know.. I don't really like to tell people about me Or talk to people in general I'm not very sociable I guess you can say I'm shy.. So it obviously kinda hard to get to know people if they won't talk to you So yea I'm hard to get to know
-5	negative	regrets	Yesh. I guess you could say stronger in some ways, but it triggered anxiety and depression and possible PTSD and all that good stuff -_- I also have a fear of everything under the sun practically. But I do think that in some ways, it has made me stronger.
-13	negative	regrets	Yes, I have done many things I'm not proud of. Most were from harsh times in my past and they were mistakes I took, but without them I would not be nearly the same person I am today. I'm very thankful for all of my mistakes. They have made me a better person. They have taught me many lessons. But if you ever have an experience you are not proud of, I'm always here as a good friend (:
-4	negative	regrets	Yes im guilty of things im not proud of. I had a baby while i was in my relationship now. I was even going to adopt my baby out for him 
-5	negative	regrets	Yes, I've got a job, after 6months trying. it's a good message and also a bad one. The good thing is that I 've got a job before leaving school(only 7days left),  sad thing is, they treat me as a newly graduate student when I in fact have 3years working experiences in this field.          Anyway, Thank Godness!
-1	negative	regrets	Yesterday once again I experienced mind numbing response from Gerrards Cross post office staff. Only a monopoly can be so arrogant.
-10	negative	regrets	You know when you force a smile- or even force a straight face- but inside you're crying? I want to run away from that. To somewhere quiet, and secluded. I want to be apart from everyone else, even my partner. I want to cry in peace and cry every single day and not have to smile and shed invisible tears. I want to run away from reality, and bring my surviving children too. But I must continue, walking into shops, and having a panic attack, and I must continue, bracing myself and for ing the tears to fall from my heart, not my eyes.
-5	negative	regrets	You want to help them but you can't because they don't understand that they need help,they are in their world,and there they want to stay. And sometimes they creat problems to other people,because of their attitude.
-5	negative	regrets	Yup, I broke my arm twice. First time cause a friend fell on it and the second time cause my dog was too strong for me when i was little. Now I have 3 Scars on my right arm.

-13	negative	revenge Confessions	40 years with this woman is just about all I can take. Instead of becoming a better person, she's getting worst. Acting more like her cheap  alcoholic father every day. She is dishonest with herself. Admits nothing and has resorted to writing apology notes because she is so full of pride, she can't stand to hear herself utter the words. I think she see's it as a sign of weakness or, maybe it takes a chip out of her competitive ego? She often tells me how well she is liked at work. Sure they like her. They pay her to slap around the dumb parents of delinquents. The crazy woman burned me with a hot plate because I said my dinner was cold. I was going to eat it cold but she ask me if it was hot. I should have lied like I usually do just to keep the peace. I'm tired of walking on egg shells just to avoid turmoil. I think she thrives on strife. It's like food to her!
-1	negative	revenge Confessions	5 or more people to help me with one simple task, all have turned their backs on me. i'm ready to just say fffing it, a live the rest of my days in solitude.
-7	negative	revenge Confessions	9 years with a man that I   Well, I think I love. He yells, he is condescending, jealous, possessive, insecure, judgemental. But according to him he's perfect. I won't take our son and leave. Why you mightask? To be honest I don't know, too scared to start again, not sure if I'll make it on my own or just plain lazy. I think that's it, too many unknowns. I wish I had the strength to leave! But Iam so emotionally co-dependent. I want to leave but I just don't know how. In essence, i am losing my life to a man who could care less. Thanks for listening.
-7	negative	revenge Confessions	Accidentally stumbled across his stash of weed, there isn't much, but at least he can stop lying to me about that he does drugs; not that I really care what he does with his own life. I'm wondering if I should get rid of some of it, an eye for an eye. About four months ago I caught him stealing from me (some money, among some other things as well) and when confronted about it (WITH PROOF) he couldn't even look me in the eye and offer up any sort of apology.I've worked for everything I have, and this ungrateful bastard goes behind my back to undermine that.. Can't believe I share the same house with him..
-5	negative	revenge Confessions	actually, I'm having a horrible couple of years. There are details, but they don't matter. Every time I'm near a busy street I have to stop myself from throwing myself in front of a car. I'm worried that one day I won't be able to stop myself.
-3	negative	revenge Confessions	Ahhhhh! The frustration is so major right now! I knew you for how many years, we had sleepovers, fun and everything and when I added you on facebook you couldn't even remember me. And now you're just friends with a bunch of people you don't even know that I know from my current school! So stupid You become such a **! friends Confessions

All I can say, is, sorry for your disapointmentYes, I did and do love you! But, at this point it doesn't matter if you are repulsed by me..such powerful words who-ever posted that confession..I realize nobody can make assumption's on this forum either
-3	negative	revenge Confessions	And I didn't even know he had a good job when I met him. I was just glad he was working and here he is making big money with a great career. How the heck did I get so lucky to have a spouse that is so generous and good for the family?
-3	negative	revenge Confessions	And I'm terrified. Because honestly, who isn't, just a little bit? Even though I'm somewhere fairly accepting and have a relatively liberal family, I'm too scared to come out in public. I was bullied for years at my old school for being an atheist, and I don't want that kind of thing to happen again. I love girls though. And I love guys. And I can't change that. And I don't WANT to change that. I just don't trust people anymore. At least, I don't trust them enough to come out at school. So I'm scared. And I'll probably keep on being scared until something(or someone)makes me want to be brave.
-6	negative	revenge Confessions	And now I'm alone. It's hard getting used to having no support system.It hurts to feel this rejection.I wish that I hadn't relied so much on my family.It's like death, but with the knowledge that they are still walking around.How do I get past this?
-12	negative	revenge Confessions	And unicorns and dragons, though I know them to be untrue. I believe that the red leaves of the fall will grant you wishes if you blow them as far as you can. I believe that wishes come true if they are made at 10:10:10 or a similar number, or if wished on the fifty-ninth second of the fifty-ninth minute. I'm pretty certain that my stuffed animals come alive whenever I leave the house. And I am convinced that mirrors are a gateway to the land of the dead. I'm still a kid inside. I know that I will always love comics over "real" books, and I will always love animation over live action. I prefer the fantasy, and you know what? I'm cool with that.

Just a little thought to keep me locked in your heartif at any time you feel the need for me,put your arms around the ones you loveand gi ve the same what you need to give to me.If ever my thoughts cross your mind just look for me in the people you love in some special way. this will make me live in your heart as well as your mind.if at any time you miss me most and feel the urge of togetherness to be tied in love You can love me most by letting your love reach out to your loved ones by embracing them with loveI know it may not sound natural may seem to be very sacrificial but spare a thought its just one intention just to be closer in your thoughts always and ever
-9	negative	revenge Confessions	back to not okay. this is sostupid. i wasnt all about it either. the physical part had great moments but lacked coordination and ..well..desire. i know my scars are bad, and the skin from losing the wieght..you arent the first person whos dumped me because of it. likely wont be the last.if you are large, and considering weight loss surgery, or losing a large amount of wieght in order to 'live a normal life"think again and talk to someone who's done it first. i was better off one hundred and ninety lbs heavier than now. i had at least the illusion of security, and the safety of my girth. now im vulnerable, and every attempt at living so called 'normal' has been disasterous. my life isnt different except im perpetually alone and devistatingly poor.this..sucks. friends Confessions

I miss you..ever so much. At times it's unbearable. But, I wait. I know if and when it's His will, I will still be waiting. Never doubt this. Never. It is my goal, my joyous duty to love and uplift as best I can. I have so much love for you it overwhelms me. Please know.my heart is true. I am true thru and thru to you and to Him. You are my one and only heartscall. And not another speck of who I amcan go anywhere without my heart, which you hold in your hands. Literally.
-11	negative	revenge Confessions	Best thing I ever did was stop looking outside myself for someone to save my soul. I haven't looked back, have taken complete responsibility for my own life, my own transgressions and my life has gotten much more peaceful.    I do believe there is a higher power somewhere overseeing all of us but to expect someone else to forgive you for sins instead of you fixing them is non sense.  I starting thinking this when I was in kindergarden.    Everyone is God.  Everything is God.  It is not a man, it is not a woman it is love in the purest form.   All the power you will ever need to get through this life is right under your nose in your heart.   ((Big Hug))

-5	negative	revenge Confessions	but I have a crush on my very best friend in the world. Not just a crush, actually. I've known that I've loved him for a long time, but platonic love. We care about and understand each other more than anyone--so there is a high level of intimacy and love between us. But the difference is that he doesn't have romantic feelings for me. I am completely and helplessly in love with him. We sit on one of our beds at night doing homework and all I want to do is reach over and hold his hand, to feel even more connected. Knowing that I can't is the most painful thing I've ever felt.
-3	negative	revenge Confessions	but is nouse, you just w/e the fack you want anyways, next time don't includeme in your plans.
-5	negative	revenge Confessions	But once I do I never look back, unless it is to grow AMD learn but not for any other reason. I cared but you didn't, I needed you to help me with this issue I have but you ignored God only knows how many attempts. You are now a stranger to me, you wanted it this way so now you have it but I can't go back again and I won't. FU for tteeating me like GARBAGE.
-5	negative	revenge Confessions	but you just treated me so badly I don't want you to be acting like this but you are and it's over no more chances Now that you did that stuff I know you think you have me wrapped around your finger but watching you do this to me I can't fool myself into thinking you're innocentgoodbye, I love you even still and I wish so badly you'd care about me somewhere in your heart but you don't no matter what you say. I know it now.Hopefully we can be friends but I don't think I can ever see you that way the only way I can see you is a person I want to love so badly but can't.

-8	negative	revenge Confessions	Confession: shock horror, I've never loved one person exclusively. I love many people, although I do have a primary love relationship. I dont believe that ANYONE isnt polygamous. I think that a lot of people lie to themselves when they are in fact polygamous.Im sure there are many like me, who know it's possible to love more than one person, and understand that there are different types of love.
-15	negative	revenge Confessions	D. - A week ago I thought it might be the last time I'd ever see you. then today, there you were. A week ago I thought I'd got the uncontrollable crying out of my system and could confine the tears till when I was alone then today, there you were. A week ago - an hour ago - I thought that re-reading the old emails and other little snippets could maybe be enough then today, there you were. Maybe I should have turned around and left, pretended I didn't see you before you saw me. But I have no control; I needed to be near you, even if just for a few minutes,even though it meant gettng my heart broken all over again. So for now I sit here at my desk and cry, hoping that tomorrow, there you will be. funny Confessions

-9	negative	revenge Confessions	Don't let what ever you see of my demeanor beguile you.  Sadly, early on I had to hide everything.  Actually it was such that only now.I'm trying to figure out what being myself means.    Inside there is a storm raging.  It varies in intensity.  With things being so messed up I have moments that I'm a fraction of a second from turning into the Incredible Hulk or something & tearing my house down with my bare hands.   At the eye of the storm is an intense need to be there for, take care of, give love & comfort to you.  I want to take away your pain so bad I can't hardly see straight.  So, I cry.and pray.   Every minute.is worth more than this whole world.and I'm melting in a sea of dispare as I watch them tick by without you.   I love you

-8	negative	revenge Confessions	Do people have no pride? Millions of people each day post random pictures of themselves on any given site, doing any given thing, for usually no given reason, yet MOST ALL fail to note the background of their images. You're SLOBS, people. I CANNOT believe the way so many people live. Do youNOT realize that you aren't simply displaying whatever riduculous thing you are intended to post about, but you are also showing the world the way in which you live, and make NO apologies for it. GROSS!! funny Confessions
-4	negative	revenge Confessions	Do people use emotional manipulation as a tool to try to manufacture emotions? I feel sad for those that continue to do this it shows how badly they were or are still mentally abused. You cannot hold onto something that never was. All you can do is try to destroy what little peace they have over some matters. In the end your Karma will be your unending unhappiness. Emotional manipulation wont make him love you or leave. friends Confessions
-5	negative	revenge Confessions	Doubt I clung to and hoped for. That's why. No one ever wants to believe someone they care about would be so  spiteful and full of hate. Just another hard lesson.

-7	negative	revenge Confessions	Ever since a very early age I have been attracted to Korean/Chinese men. Iv'e never even known why iv'e had this attraction on them I just do. Because of thisattraction, I'm not even attracted to my race which would be white/European men. When I think of it though, Maybe I don't want to be attracted to my race I find myself happier dating an Asian man than dating a white man. The only person iv'e ever told about my "attraction" to is my mother. She seemed to take it well which is a good thing. sometimes I find myself being very shy around men I am attracted to and then I find that most of my guy friends I have are white. I hope that one day I can confess this to anyone. friends Confessions
-7	negative	revenge Confessions	Ever wonder if you were adopted? Here's some tried-and-true hints I picked up on to determine my own paternity and maternity:1. You don't remember your parents bringing you home from the hospital where you were born.2. Your parents don't let you go out alone at night, when your REAL parents might try to steal you back.3. Other family members enjoy food that taste "yucky" to you.4. Only adopted, or "rejected" children have to brush their teeth.Remember! If it turns out you were adopted, DO NOT MISBEHAVE IN ANY WAY, or your "parents" will sell you back to the gypsies.

-3	negative	revenge Confessions	Everyone seems to brag about the 'thick skin' advice. But how do you do it? How do you just turn around and not care? People make it seem like it's nothing difficult.Today someone attacked me for being 26 and still living with family. This has not been the first time someone attacked me on this very thing this year. For whatever reason, I have gotten at least 2 to three other random people who seemed to have laughed about it.I realize that as someone who will be thirty in only four years should have been out on their own by now. But how do you do that with a full college schedule and still suffering from a lay off four years ago? Sometimes people can be so incredibly thoughtless to not even consider what storms a person may be going through, especially in an economy that is not very promising.I'm thankful my parents have taken me in, though.

Now that I'm more mature, I have better control.

I prefer marijuana in the long run because I'm a health buff and the effects are better. friends Confessions

I want this year to be especially meaningful as it has been a tougher than usual year on her.

I am constantly lonely, Constantly being used and thrown away like trash. the pain I hide deep down is enough to kill most people, andwhen I am wronged I want to hurt the person who wronged me, whether physically or psychologically. Am I a fool to think that there is someone for me in this world?I don'y want my lonliness and pain to consume me, but it's all I have to keep me alive

But if I talk to them I get really hot, sweaty, nauseous, dizzy, and I've even fainted in front of three old women. But these old people that make me nauseous aren't young old, like 60 years old. They're like 90-something and look as if they are on their way out. Sad part is, my 92 year old grandma is here for a visit and I can't even be in the same room with her. Once, we were both in the backseat of the car for an hour drive and I got so nauseous. Her hand was touching my leg and I started shaking and crying. When we stopped at a gas station I threw up in the bathroom. I just focused on my ipod for the rest of the drive but my leg was still shaking since she was still touching it. My mom asked why I seemed so sick and distraught. I couldn't bring myself to tell my mom that her mom was making me sick. =(

-6	negative	revenge Confessions	have been unable to surrender to any pleasure finer than you.  This love that settled into my bones was always yours, so fragile and indecisive.   When I woke up today, like every other day, my world was still spinning around you, my heart was bracing for another day of longing and I told myself "just one more day, just one more day". I don't know why I use that mantra. Maybe it is because I am strangely addicted to hope. It's much better than the reality of "you need to close the door, you need to close the door." Nevermore. And then I remind myself to breathe as the demons mock my patience with you.
-25	negative	revenge Confessions	Have you ever felt like you are so young to love? Well I don't I'm 16 & I feel like I've found mr.right. Am I wrong for knowing really early who I want to be w.for the rest of my life? I don't think so, he's really far from me and in 6 months that we've been going out I've seen him twice. It sounds crazy but the time we have seen each other I feel a vibe that I have never felt in my life for no other guy. I feel like he cares about me so much it actually feels good. I can see myself w.him for a very long time. I mean I know I'm young I understand that. We're like any other couple as well we argue, but I'm not stupid either if he's my mr.wrong than I'll deal w.it. I just hope he's the ONE. He shows me he's not doing anything like cheating. I stay on the phone w.him a lot, now to come to think of it do you think I'm in a good relationship? Writing all this is making me think more about what he really does since I'm not w.him all the time. Am I wrong for staying w.him? -anonymouscc

-10	negative	revenge Confessions	honestly, if anyone wanted to read my crap, they'd ask, right? And if was any good, they'd probably want to read more. And if I had a future in it, I'd use a much more brilliant pseudonym. And if I had any talent at all for the medium, I'd probably have more readers. And if I really knew how to write, I'd actually sell my books. After all this type dissing bad writing, the worst of it was my own. And unlike others, I actually went out and solicited others to read my tripe. GAWD. {shrinks into the background} Ciara was right, a writer is either all in, or needs to stop.

-2	negative	revenge Confessions	How could he do this to me when Im already having such a bad time? Lift me up and then drop me from a great height! I just didnt need this. I'd rather have NO interest than someone flirt and show me interest, then back away for no apparent reason. I didnt need my heart messed with, really could have done without the complication 
-12	negative	revenge Confessions	How could I escape you if youre everywhere I try to go. You are the scents I smell, the sounds I hear, the words I speak, the comfort I seek, the force I loathe, the weakness in my strength, but most of all, youre my greatest desire. Any thought of mine that doesnt remind me that youre still here, somewhere in this city, is no thought of mine. You are the wisp of warm air that runs by my ears in the morning, and the dew on my windshield that reminds me that its a new day. New or old, any day is one with you, in my heart, in my core, and I cannot shake you off of my shoulders or out of my already disheveled hair. Youre weighing me down, this love is a burden now, and to say so makes me shudder. I never wanted to admit to myself the possibility that some day youd find your piece of mind out of mine.

-10	negative	revenge Confessions	I am dating a younger man he is 11 years younger.  We been together for one year and  I care for him a lot.  I always say he is only 8 years younger and he does not know.  I have two children and he has none.  THE Problem is that I cant have any more.  He says that should not be a problem, but I feel that I am taking the opportunity of fatherhood from him.  I care for him deeply and he cares for me.  Im just afraid.  I am am always told I look up 10 years younger and that he look 8 years older.
-4	negative	revenge Confessions	I am deeply in with my partner. His confessions have worried me, and I want to keep him healthy. For the time we are together, I'm going to try and keep him as happy as I can.

I should hope that we make a good team, so we'll battle through any hardships during this time with relative ease.

Why do anything else for now?  I know I am making someone feel weird. I wanted to try to get it out. I can't. I know I need to shut up. Too much. Too long. Futile. No more posts. My life is a mess. I can't fix any of it. Sorry. I do love someone with all of my heart and soul.  Not that it matters anyway. I am and have always been a mistake.  It is just too freaking hard and I can't take it any more. I don't have the courage to say anything and I can't bear another person hating me or lecturing me. It is what it is. I tried for a long time.  I failed.

-9	negative	revenge Confessions	I am really beginning to   if this is a good website for me or not. I thought that it would help me get a lot of my emotions that I dont feel comfortable talking to people about. I think I was wrong because for the most part I have just been hit on by guys. That is not why I am on this website and I DONT WANT MARRIED MEN hitting on me anymore. Thats sick and demented that someone could do that behind their wives back (or husbands). Even more reason for me not to trust men.
-5	negative	revenge Confessions	I am so sad that my younger   is freeloading off of me. I resent this. Believe it or not, I am afraid of him because he easily finds my weaknesses and trigger my hurtful spot.  He doesn't pay enough rent, he thinks he pays enough money for food and utilities, and the sad this is that my mom is also living with me.  Im just so tired of this. I need to take care of my own family.  My mom and my brother are taking advantage of me. But I dont have the courage to tell them how I really feel. friends Confessions

I think of it whenever I'm in pain, I think of it whenever I meet someone else who tries to take their place I can't stand it. Betrayal is so bitterits left me jaded and weak. What was the point of losing everything that mattered? Or is there no point, and life just sucks..?
-8	negative	revenge Confessions	I am terrified to be alone. I feel like I'm always searching for someone. I haven't been in a relationship last longer then 2 or 3 months since my first bf and I broke up after 3 years. I keep hoping that the next guy will be the one that is the right one. But honestly I still sometimes think that my ex might hav been the one and that we will get back together. I wish that we would, even though he treated me like crap while we were dating and after. I drive by his house almost everyday on my way to work and I glance in that direction to see if he's home. I've seen him around town and in his yard. I still get that racey feeling in my chest. Its crazy, but god I can't help it.

-11	negative	revenge Confessions	I can't help feeling like your lying to me to make me like you. For starters, I'm am nobody for you to have to try and please with lies. I am a simple human and you should not need to fabricate your life in order tohold our convos. But what do I know? Maybe you are descended from royalty in India, and your family owns libraries, and your filthy rich (maids, drivers, personal hair stylists), and have about 50 hot Indian bachelors staying on your family's land. Who am I to not believe you when you tell me how oh so conservative your family is when you apparently have boys sneaking into your room at night, taking you away for 2 day trips and taking you on moonlight strolls on Saturday nights?Even if your lying, I'll still talk to you, but please. False information is unecessary. I like people for who they are and not what they have or what they do~ Just thought I'd get that off my chest.

His house is super huge and it smells so nice and well spending some time together is nice. We dont get dirty, all we do is kiss and snuggle but when I come home I always get yelled at. I lie to my mom saying that I am with some friends at the park but she doesnt buy it. She is not okay with dating although we dont do anything wrong and we have been going out and hiding it from her for a YEAR (O4/29/1 And I really love this guy<3 THERE, I SAID IT (;

I was givin this gift from Godthat I wasnt even prepared forwhile other women who have been hopeing and praying for a baby cant even have one if their lives depended on it. IfI wasnt blessed with the gift of breasts,I dont even think I would be able to afford to feed him. I am also living in a shelter. I lived with his dad while I was pregnant and he broke up with me when I was 6 months and before I knew itI had no where else to go.Dont get me me wrong, I am great with my sonhe is a happy baby, but I know he deserves more..more than what I have to offer. He is so beautiful and I love him alot. I have thought about many times what his life would be like if he was adopted into a wealthy family.where money is just not an issue, it depresses me. I know that there is always room for things to get better. When I finally findstability in my lifeI know my feelings will change about being a mother.just not yet.
-9	negative	revenge Confessions	I don't get her. She can be ridiculously nice. Then evil. I've never seen anything like it. She'll cook my friends and I breakfast, sing in the mornings and dance and make everyone around her laugh. Then something in her snaps and she's just mean. I thought it was hormonal but sometimes her meanness lasts for a month. She'll fight with my mom. She'll scream at me and my friends. I don't know what to do. Then!! The next day she comes into my room acting like nothing ever happened and tells me she loves me and that I'm the best brother she could ever have. What's going on? Why does my sister make living here ridiculous. I feel like i'm treading on a field of landmines in my own home. I never know what might upset her. Sometimes the same thing that makes her laugh, will make her scream and throw things. friends Confessions
-3	negative	revenge Confessions	I don't give a bleep how many times the ladies you used to work with at Wal-Mart from the Philippines told you to leave me and marry their daughter instead because she was "thin, pretty, and very domestic" or "wanted lots of babies". Trophy wives don't go for Wal-Mart janitors last I checked, unless they're after a green card. I can't believe that after so many years of marriage, after me busting my  to raise our child, go to college, and work, while you swilled beer and played in a band or sat on the computer every spare minute you had, you can sit on our porch and brag to your sister about people who told you your wife was ugly and lazy! You should have moved to the f-ing Philippines you douche!!! Then you wouldn't be my problem anymore. Eff you. If I had enough money I would file for divorce.
-12	negative	revenge Confessions	I don't hate her. I don't even dislike her. Although I don't agree with how she handled things or treated people, I can sort of understand. I know that if the same thing happened to me, I would not have done what she did & said what she said just because that is not who I am. I am a very inward person. I don't enjoy expressing myself, especially at the expense of others. I would rather rip myself toshredsthan even take a chance of hurting someone else. I'm sorry for her. I'm sorry that she might blame me for some of her pain even though I did nothing wrong, I'm sorry she felt that she had to say & do those things, I'm sorry she felt the way she felt & possibly feels the way she feels. I'm just sorry.
-16	negative	revenge Confessions	I don't know how to   just a little bit. I love with my whole being. I love all of you, all the time, for all you were, all you are and all you will ever be. I love you inside and out. Your good side, your bad side, your boring moments, your exciting moments. I love you in the rain and in the sunshine. I love you when you are sad or happy. I love you when you are mad or when you could conquer the world. I love your home, what you drive, your friends. I love your hair, your feet, your stubborness and your compassion. I could type all night about what I love about youor at least what I could have loved, if you would have let me.
-2	negative	revenge Confessions	I dont know how to say this, but I dont believe in love becoz I have always failed but now, I love her .. i really do, I want her to be mine, I wanna kiss her, hug her, show her some of my affections. but she does not care, or at least I am not courage enough to do that she is leaving in 3 days and I most probably I might not see her again in my whole life. what should I do? I cannot say anything now, I just have to burn silently. I wish I can get her out of my mind, I wish I can fix what happened this really sucks! :'(

-12	negative	revenge Confessions	I don't know why but somehow, I like telling myself that I'm and ugly, horrible person who isn't worth nyones attention that no cares about. I like knowing that they will all carry on their lives, not even think about me if ever something happened to me. I prefer hurting myself rather than someone else does for me. Besides, it's not like I'm lying or anything. I probably am an ugly and horrible person who doesn't deserves to be loved
-1	negative	revenge Confessions	I don't know why I put up with the crape I do but I hats him more and more everyday and the sad thing my ex of three yrs ago would give me the world and I wont go back to him =[
-10	negative	revenge Confessions	I don't know your circumstance, but if it helps,  getting to know the person really well that you think you are falling for is a good way to figure out your true feelings. Particularly, if it is not an ideal situation for some reason, which you seem to allude to. Imagination can sometimes take over, and if you don't base your feelings on who this person is, they might end up being completely different than what you thought or dreamed they would be.  I guess I am saying, weigh your options carefully. Most importantly, let God lead you through His Word.
-3	negative	revenge Confessions	I don't want to talk to any of the people I went to school with. I feel like they'd judge me harshly and I'd be embarrassed. I wish I hadn't had to move so much as a child. I don't have a life anywhere. What little stability I've had has been so tenuous, and about to be thrown out the window again (thank you again economy, over the last 24 years you've come back again and again to remind me that I exist for your wellbeing instead of the other way around). I just keep hoping that the next step I take will settle things. The chaos will be over, the world will fall into order, I'll be able to see and do the things that need to be done, and I'll get the things I need in return. Had someone confess to me recently that I didn't get a job, not because I wasn't qualified, but because their friend's kid was in the lineup. Oh well. Whatever.

And I work with no pay, no time off, no vacations, and no benefits. There will be no money for my retirement. And I have no time, anymore, to even dream the dreams I once had; never mind accomplish them.I'm tired of being a SAHM.I'm tired of being a wife and a mother.I'm tired of my life.I am such a terrible, terrible person.
-3	negative	revenge Confessions	If I had enough of an income to secure my own place to live, and everything else necissary. If I just had the money, I would absolutely neverspeak to my parents again.
-11	negative	revenge Confessions	If it makes YOU feel better to think I don't love you, fine, but you know better.   If you think for one moment I believe any of these words of love here are for me you are mistaken.   Not even wishful thinking as I know where I have always stood in your life. In the nosebleed seats.  I come here because something in my heart tells me that even if your intentions are not honorable, somehow it helps you to know I care enough to write.  Here there everywhere.  It's called love.   I have plead my case, asked for your hand to hold and my answer was a bitter pill.   Silence.  Deafening.  I can take it but it has not been a picnic.  I assure you.
-6	negative	revenge Confessions	If I was desperate to have you back in my life wouldn't you think I would have tried much harder, after all, I have a tendency to achieve my goals.  I don't consider a person a goal.   You either want me in your life or you do not.  Your actions long ago said "absolutely no" and they still do.    Taking it personal would be very silly.  I can love anyone I want.  I can still say I love you if you despise me.  I do nothing to interrupt your life, nor have I.   You should at least be grateful to me for that.  If you don't get me, not my problem.
-1	negative	revenge Confessions	If you want attention, go out and make some friends. don't come here and try to manipulate sympathy out of people with self-indulgent whining that's some sort of transmogrification of actual emotional honesty, distorted into a caricature of purple prose and pain. now, specifically, which confession do you mean?

-13	negative	revenge Confessions	I guess this more of a rant but i can't stand my ex mother. Unfortunetly she is one of those mothers that is all invovled in her sons everything,last bowel movement etc. She tells him to take me to court so she can get visiting rights to our daughter ,meanwhile she is a giant drug addict and acoholic,like really lady?!!! Even though i know she will look like a fool in court,i just dont get why she has to put me through drama and why her son doesnt stand up like a man and tell her to but out. I had an argument with her recently and she was standing near stairs,she got into my face yelling obsenities and all i could think of was kicking her in the face and watching her fall down stairs.Horrible i know but she does horrific things to me,stealing from my bank account,sneaking into my home,just crazy things.ughhh

-11	negative	revenge Confessions	I had a fiance once. Then I left him and went back home. I live with my father now. And I can say I am happier.But one thing bothers me. He and I had a blood bond. We'd drink and drink and drink. It's hard to say what I'ddo to taste him once again. But I know deep down, If I went back. we'd only fall in love again. So I stay away.And cannot clench this thirst.

Jack  am I for taking your advice in the first place and believing all of your crap. I have decided the whole point was retaliation. Hell, who knows, that was probably you who told anyways. Like I saidJack . (I'm pretty sure you've been called that MANY times before). You helped me ruin my life.

-5	negative	revenge Confessions	I have a syndrome, that not many people know about. And it gets to me, its called polland syndrome, and it means the one breast is bigger than the other.. and its really hard to deal with being a teenager, and you know having boyfriends. I feel like im the only one sometimes. I cant wear normal bathing suits, or low cut shirts. Im so ashamed.. and i just need someone to turn too.
-14	negative	revenge Confessions	I have a thought, a  . This fiction I play in my mind. It's 3 AM, I am alone. Unable to sleep. I can't stop thinking about this fiction, this dream. I dream of a woman that will make my heart race and my skin flush. Always in flux. Her voice enthrals me. Her womanly scent hints of Fig's and Vanilla. Each step towards lifts me up. Each step away crushes. I long to hold this fiction in my arms. Feel her pressed against me. My cheek pressed against her hair. Her arms pressing me in closer. I want this moment in my dream to last. I want this fiction real. Through sheer will, this fictional woman will be with me. Until the alarm rings in another day. Leaving her to haunt me. Her presence just out of reach. This makes me smile. Each and every day.
-5	negative	revenge Confessions	I have been deliberately trying to replace people with same names on my facebook as my relatives to show them they are not irriplaceable. I have been writing out invites to my wedding to strangers and thinking about renting a crowd is that weird? its just that done of my relatives have ever been nice to me. I can find look-a likes and stage the whole thing! it might sound like an elaborate practicle joke. but to me its a reality. I just want revenge!
-10	negative	revenge Confessions	I have been good friends with this guy for about five years. It has always been platonic. I have hung out with him, partied together, and even went out oftown. Last Saturday we hung out and something happened. We didn't go all the way but I woke up naked. I feel very strange and weird. I have never felt thisway about him. I'm wondering where these feelings are coming from and why did it happen. We kinda just brushed it off. He is talking to some married womanwho he says he is in love with.I don't understand why I felt a little jealous when he mentioned her this time. This is weird.
-9	negative	revenge Confessions	I have been sitting on my arse, doing this boring assignment.

-3	negative	revenge Confessions	I have boyfriend that I no longer  .  I am in love with a male coworker and friend.  It will never happen, and I can't seem to bring myself to break my boyfriend's heart.  I've always put other people before myself.  Their happiness has always been more important than my own.  I no longer exist for myself.  I only exist for other people, and I don't know how to change it.  The only way out seems to be death.  I've always had this little voice inside my head that tells me every bad thing I've ever done and every degrading thing anyone has ever called me.  These days it is the only thing I hear.  I should just give in.  I don't want to feel this way anymore.  I don't want to feel.
-2	negative	revenge Confessions	i have decided to be unavailable to you and not leave you offline messages for a whilei want you to miss meso that your feelings for me will be stronger..

-3	negative	revenge Confessions	I HAVE NOTHING I'M LIVINGWITH MY EX-HUSBAND BECAUSE HE'S MY ONLY FRIEND
-11	negative	revenge Confessions	I haven't been happy in my   in a really long time. In March I began seeing a mutual friend of mine and my husband's and it eventually led to an affair. I had decided that it was the time to tell my husband how I feel and begin the divorce process. I got a lawyer, kicked my husband out, and proceeded to start over. I can't even pinpoint one thing that led to us getting back together, but here we are, together again. He's a wonderful person, and I'm left wondering if something is wrong with me-why can't I just be happy with the way things are? I really don't want to hurt him again. The amount of love this man has for me is staggering. Why do I have such a problem with loving him the way he loves me? He told me before that if we get back together then it has to be forever because he can't go through losing me again. So now I feel stuck. The thought has already crossed my mind to cheat again. I just don't know what to do.
-1	negative	revenge Confessions	I have recently discovered that I'm a creep. Now to learn and embrace the creepy lifestyle. Life is after all, all about change.
-9	negative	revenge Confessions	I  have recently joined "facebook" and found many people from my past while browsing through people. I was going to contact some and then sat back and thought F%$K them! If you google my name I come up first in a google search out of 623 results. They over the years had many times if they would have thought about me to just do a quick search and hit that enter button and  their I am. I guess that's the way it is.
-16	negative	revenge Confessions	I have this save the world complex one person at a time. It affects every aspect of my life, people I date usually end up having some problems from drinking to being crazy, I always try to fix it. People I meet and become friends with who I think I might be able to help by being kind, helpful, ect. People I ask to move in with me as roommates. I get burnt every time, people who care about me keep asking why do i put myself in those situations, tell me that it is not a bad thing to be selfish sometimes. Lately I was able to let it go a little, trying to take a step back and care for myself first before I can fix others. I don't want to sound like I try to fix everything and everyone, it is just in relationship and/ or friendship I used to give my 100% and get nothing back. Try to help if i can, try to be the best I can Now, I am not saying I don't care, I just try to stop myself before I jump in head first. Does that make sense?
-3	negative	revenge Confessions	I   her. I lost touch with her physically, but never spiritually. We are two halves a whole. Each lost without the other. Drawn to each other when apart but never have the halves  joined. What wonders would occur at that joining? I fear we will never know. Too many forces work against it.
-4	negative	revenge Confessions	I honestly think running away is the best thing I can do right now. I feel so stressed and trapped and just want to move on with my life. I'm tired of the same thing happening even after several warnings. Everything is always fine for about a week and then it just goes right back to where it was. I've learned to just block out these feelings but I can only take so much before I finally break.There's very few things and people I want to stay back for but I still would leave. Plus the world is big, I'm sure there's someone else to talk to. friends Confessions
-2	negative	revenge Confessions	I hope he dies of a heart attack
-4	negative	revenge Confessions	I just can't sleep. I can't. He keeps visiting me in my dreams. I fall asleep late with tears in my eyes. In my dream I am trying to tell him something - he doesn't seem to care. Then he disappears slowly .. I twist and turn in my bed until I wake up. I feel the sweat on my face and the wettness of my eyes and I just know that I dreamed about him again. My friends think I'm crazy .. they don't understand.
-3	negative	revenge Confessions	I just cut myself. I was feeling horrible i had to do it.
-6	negative	revenge Confessions	I just got my appetite back and now I am having trouble choking down some fries. Not even that much food either just a medium sized pack. I ate most of the cheesy bites its just I can't eat it. I don't think I'm fat or anything im close to underweight now but I just can't eat. I don't know what to do. My boyfriends noticed me not eating and he said he was worried. I have a fainting disorder and I've been getting more and more dizzy. I know I need to eat and I am hungry i just try and it doesn't happen. I'm considering turning to weed maybe. It's supposed to make you crave food. So maybe if I get too emaciated I might have to try. I don't want to start using drugs though. I can face reality without help from that.

I do not care if this love is fleeting like mist before the dawn. Let me get lost in you. In those eyes so blue.

Am I not pretty enough like other girls? Am I not in good enough shape? I love you, I just want to be with you, why do you always push me away, or ignore me? Please be my husband again, please just love me the way you used to.

-7	negative	revenge Confessions	I'm completely obsessed with becoming a kid again. Not as in an adult who acts like a child, but really a child. It seems usually with people, they get older there comes a point where they desire to be Youthful againmaybe anywhere from 17-30. Well as my 19th birthday approachesand all this past year in fact, I've yearned to be a child. Around 6-13. I don't know why. I don't remember those years as being my best.I guess I just felt more alive then. What ever it is, I can't help but desire to go back.
-10	negative	revenge Confessions	I'm content. Every thing and everyone in my life is right. Except you. Where are you? What have you been up to? Have you thought about me half as much as I've thought about you? I'm thinking no. If that were the case you would most definitely go out of your way to catch up. Get it? Make like a tomato and Ketchup! Har har har(corny joke drums to follow)I feel like every time I'm close to finishing this puzzle..that final piece just never really seems to fit and I wind up looking for a new set to put together. Just to make sure that you fit. If this makes any sense. I know I won't give up, but may do so if you don't come around eventually.I know you're so close yet you feel so far. I'm afraid though. And I wish you'd reassure me that I shouldn't be. It's just so hard. I feel like I'm the rookie and you're the Newby. Or does it sound the other way around?I better just let you spread those wings(not loins) and fly LOLOL

-11	negative	revenge Confessions	I'm in my twenties  never had a boyfriend don't have any friends I'm not smart and my boss loves to use me. Most of my life i never fitted in I got teased at school because I stunk and had headlice what my class mates didn't know was that I was homeless at the time and my family and I lived out of a tent or car and could only get to a shower once a week. When I was 14 I started working for a guy who I'm still working for. Often he hits me and I get abused every day I've come to the fact that I was a mistake and was never ment to be born. today I even tried to kill my self but couldn't even do that right. Everyday I wish I had a friend just to talk to I never go out and when I do I have panic attacks about being around people. I just wish my life was different!

-2	negative	revenge Confessions	I miss you my TF. We will always be a part of one another. You breath, I breath. I feel you watching over me, and I watch over you. I feel you seeking for me, and I seek back. I feel your uncertainty, and I whisper words of encouragement. I feel you in the early mornings, and I reach out and know I am holding you close. I feel your thoughts, and I smile. I feel your warmth, and I sigh. I feel your love, and I return it earnestly. I want to be wrapped close in your arms surrounded by your cloak of love. One day soon, we will be.

-2	negative	revenge Confessions	I'm married but yet I feel as if I'm alone! Why did I get married at 21 I'm so stupid I don't even feel loved
-16	negative	revenge Confessions	I'm not embarrassed about being caught naked. What really embarrases me is having my clothes stolen so I can't get dressed. This happed to me when I was 16 years old in summer school camptrip. After swimming I went to take a shower, left all my things on a bench andeverything was gone when I came out. I found myself stract naked with boys cuming in. At first I thought they walked in by accident, but soon discovered they were there to have fun looking at me. What horrified me wasthe extended time I was forced to display myself naked in front of them and their comments about my breast and **.I got to the point offeeling so humiliated there was no point in covering myself. Letting look at me is how I got my clothes back. A later found out my girl friend had stolen my stuff and told boys to go inside. They sure had a good long laugh at my expense.
-2	negative	revenge Confessions	I'm not in   with my husband of 10 years anymore. It's time for change
-2	negative	revenge Confessions	im not that stupid u big freakin nutsometimes i take the bait on purpose do u ever know when
-12	negative	revenge Confessions	I'm not the one that this is attached to. I tried over the months to get you to see that nothing stays secret.and you just have such a mean streak. Unleashed it on me for no reasonjust the hell of it.If I were you, I think I'd at least be nice. A little. I know you have all kinds of friends. Never fell for that. I just kept quiet. There's just no way I will ever believe you loved me. I know your shy or whatever. I also know you have a backbone, big time. Come on. You weren't here cause you didn't want to be and you didn't want to be cause, well. You know.I kinda feel like roadkill right now. funny Confessions
-5	negative	revenge Confessions	I'm probably running away tonight. Im not really entirely sure why, but I just feel the need to. I have about 56 dollars. And I'm planning on just leaving for a few days and then coming back. I really just need to leave. Im leaving my cell phone at my house so no one can track me or anything. I'm also leaving a note. I'm just confused about this, but i'll probably just take a train to new york city or new haven and then come back. <3
-12	negative	revenge Confessions	Im really tired of being alone, I'm always alone. I'm home alone, I go out, alone, even when I'm with other people I'm alone. Wondering when someone will be here. Even of they are just pretending to care.
-3	negative	revenge Confessions	I'm selling everything I own that isn't an absolute necessity and moving to Chicago in January. I'm not telling me roommate.
-2	negative	revenge Confessions	I'm sick of davezsecret's pale knockers getting in the way of me reading confessions. ugh. How many times do i have to flag him/her?
-11	negative	revenge Confessions	Im sorry I wasn't the woman you needed to make you a better man. I do get jealous of your relationship but hide it well. Im sorry our marriage ended we had such high hopes and dreams, but we do have a growing legacy with our sons. I hope that what you have now will fulfill everything I could not. I hope you find joy and happiness from now until that day you draw your last breathe. I do love you now, and it hurts like hell to ignore you and treat you like I don't to appease your family. I never divorced you because honestly I have never wanted to be anyone else's wife. I still don't.
-1	negative	revenge Confessions	I'm supposed to be a Christian, but I find Wiccan so.interesting.
-6	negative	revenge Confessions	I'm thinking the next time I see you will probably be the last. This is way too difficult for me. I lost you as a friend too. It doesn't seem fair. That's what happens when you let emotions rule, right? I act before I think. How I regret my actions. I couldn't help the love, but I learned my lesson the worst way possible. Don't ever tell someone you love them when you're already married. Seems like a no-brainer, but apparently, not for me. 
-8	negative	revenge Confessions	i'm watching a show about drugs and iwas thinking about it.truth is drugs are cool,i know others make more friends instead being like me,lonely. I want to make a call and ask the effects of drugs.I heard marijuana is safer so?it's the same drinking right?and might help forget some things.i want to try,something new
-5	negative	revenge Confessions	I   my family.But they do not understand me.My problems need their attention and time.I am depressed and lonely.I do not have anyone to care for me.I need respect from my family because I do not get that at work.I need a friend in my siblings because I do not have any friends.But they just use it to torture me more.My parents do not listen to me when I express my self.How can they be so insensitive?It makes me feel lonely and it hurts.When it comes to making me feel ashamed of myself,they are so interested.My siblings use my social anxiety problem as weapon to hurt me more.My family says I am weird and that is why I do not have friends.There is no one to share my feelings.Even though it is not rational but some how putting it all over a computer screen calms me down a little. friends Confessions
-5	negative	revenge Confessions	I need a girl to talk tosomeone to flirt with someone who is nice and smart had incredible conversation.and probably attractive (no im not shallow at all)by girl I mean Woman understand im only 19 I am attractive in case you were wondering but I just want to talkI know it's weird for someone random to post such a thing.but I figure why not.Im a good normal person and besides i just want to talkand flirt.I feel the need to type more..but I don't want to seem weirdI hope someone Messages meI yearn for conversationand at times I feel lonelyso please message me if you would like to talk simple as that :-}
-2	negative	revenge Confessions	I need to go to church and have a real relationship with Jesus Christ, I always getting this bad feelings without him :/ I think hes trying to give me a second chance even though I'm always a F@ck since my Teenage years.
-11	negative	revenge Confessions	I never planned to have an affair I truly   my husband. I don't know what it was that caught me by suprise. The way he looked at me, his smile or the raw desire that I could sense everytime I was near him. Now I find my self stuck in between the man I have commited my life to and the man I love. I have never been one to take risks but the past few months have been nothing like ever before and each day I go deeper and deeper into a world I never imagined for myself.
-5	negative	revenge Confessions	i never told anyone my boyfriend hits me. four times in 3 years and 4 months. its not much but i want him to get help. i dont want him down that road. any advice?
-8	negative	revenge Confessions	In June I graduated from high school. My high school career consisted of two different schools. One in NY which I attended for freshman, sophomore, and senior year. One in NJ which I attended for my junior year only. I'm a female and junior year I became very close with a female english teacher of mine. I moved back to NY after junior year. Well, I went to visit her at her house in NJ this and she asked me to sleep over. We smoked pot, drank, went out for dinner, and had a  with her and her husband. friends Confessions
-1	negative	revenge Confessions	Insignificant and not even worth mentioning, unless you are making fun of them.
-4	negative	revenge Confessions	In the Lord, he makes no mistakes. He knows the end of each path that I take, for when I am tried and purified, I shall come forth as gold.
-3	negative	revenge Confessions	I passed by my house three times in tears tonight before I finally had the courage to pull into the drive. I DID decide its time for a change tonight. friends Confessions
-26	negative	revenge Confessions	I really hate how my boyfriend's parents told me that i could move in with them since my mom lived inFresnoand i had my friends in a town where they live. The first night i sleep in their house i hear them whispering about methen a couple weeks later they talking about how i am changing their son and they don't like me, they don't want me living here for free but they knew my mom would have a hard time paying them since she's a single mother with 5 kids and has just a GEDbarelygets hiredshe needs a man..and i am tired of living poor it sucksThen i remember when i spent the night a long time ago and they said they were going toseparateme and myboyfriendit hurts me but what hurts the most is that they promised they'd help my family out but my boyfriends parentsrarelyask how my mom's doing and they even forget i had a family.Finally now my mom got anapartmentand can now go back with her while living in this town where i have friends even if it's just 3. 
-2	negative	revenge Confessions	I really hate my dad, but my mom won't let me express myself at all to him, not even an unkind word. As such I've had to suppress my emotions which leads to disaster. I haven't been able to cry properly for years and I'm holding myself back from arguing with my dad every time I talk to them. I just thought I would post this, let off a little steam.
-5	negative	revenge Confessions	i really need to talk to a few friends here but i feel like i cant for more than a few reasons. so i wont even log in. it isnt fair anyway. i just want to angrily rant to them all my frustrations. theyre the only ones who will understand though. the only ones who will just say it like it is bluntly and honestly. i really need that friends Confessions
-2	negative	revenge Confessions	I really should take my own advice when I write something as silly as this:
-2	negative	revenge Confessions	Is Charlie Sheen a better role model? He seems like a really great guy in general. This one feels right.
-13	negative	revenge Confessions	I seem to have a problem saying no.  If it's in my face, or if I notice someone with obvious physical tendencies of someone who's just done it I have no shame, I ask them for a bump.  Its the same with alcohol. I convince myself that one is enough. Yet, one turns into two, two turns into five; and the rest is lost between that and being alone in my bed. Feeling like I've let myself down. Again.  The feeling of shame, mostly goes with the  obnoxious person I become. Saying everything and anything that comes to mind, with little to zero regards to anyone's feelinigs.
-1	negative	revenge Confessions	i see you, i feel like making   to you. .
-1	negative	revenge Confessions	i should have killed myself last year i didn't and i regret it everyday
-6	negative	revenge Confessions	I sit there and go through every single little split end in my hair. I never used to have this habit. One day I was styling my hair and I noticed a split at the end of my strand, and I started to find more. Now I do it all the time. Today I found one with almost 15 splits up the strand. I felt disgusted. I've got to buy new shampoos and stop straightening my hair. I'm doing more bad than good. And I need to get out of this habit. It's weird.
-1	negative	revenge Confessions	I skipped my accounting class today just so that I could pack a bowl for me and my body. Anybody ever do the same thing?
-1	negative	revenge Confessions	Is my cousin!!! i am kinda ashamed.. funny Confessions
-4	negative	revenge Confessions	 is not a word I throw around precariously, like so many people do. I use it when I feel it, know itin my heart, head, body and soul. If I ever decide it's worth it (total vulnerability, heart wide open, feeling *REALLY* safe with you - which I do not at this juncture & you know why) to tell you I love you, you can bet your sweet  it's coming from a very pure place, and that it's both wonderful and scary for me to share that truth with you. friends Confessions
-3	negative	revenge Confessions	is nothing to talk about when you both have a ring on your finger. You both committed yourselve to someone else. Let go of a fantasy you can only dream of.
-1	negative	revenge Confessions	I   someone who will never love me back. It hurts. How's that for emotional depth?!!
-9	negative	revenge Confessions	I sometimes look at pictures of myself and think to myself, gosh Im beautiful.Sad thing is when others look at my pictures they say the same thing, but what they dont know is the struggle and hurt and pain I go through everyday.Thats a secret not many people know.Its hard to look at me and see all the hurt I have.. I wish others were more sensitve of my feelings. funny Confessions
-2	negative	revenge Confessions	Is people like you who can't understand that other people are in emotional pain. The reason why you can't see is because you are immensely self-centered and selfish. You are cold-hearted until it is about YOU. friends Confessions
-2	negative	revenge Confessions	I still want to sleep with other ladies, irrespective of what my wife thinks
-10	negative	revenge Confessions	i strongly believe my baby inside me deserves a   and father. but the biological father is not in the picture nor does he want to. so because i believe and recommend a mother and father i am trying to consider adoption. i do not want to nor did i ever think i would but because i am single and live with my jobless lazy mother i am forced to think of adoption. so i guess my confession to all of you is that i am now looking for a father figure for my baby.
-4	negative	revenge Confessions	I swear.If I hear one more   fuker say one damn more word about the illegal use of "medicinal' maragootch, imma bust a bottlecap on someones . I can do it too, one snap.             BAM! *~~~~~~That's right, *'s about to get real y'all.stfu and pass that sonofabitch! funny Confessions
-10	negative	revenge Confessions	I swear to * god, the thing I hate the most is an  kisser. You may hate me, "not 'like' me", but there is one thing about me, and that is that i'm REAL. If i'm against something, i'm not gonna kiss your  and be on the same side. The difference between me and my HALF brother, is that I don't give a flying * if a person does not like me. HE has to have everyone like him, so he kisses as many ** as it will take, but then when the person  him off, he comes to me to ** and complain about them, and call them names. How about you tell them what you tell me, oh wait, you can't because you have your head up their .I can't even come up stairs to go to the * bathroom without someone listening by the door while I shower, or go in right after me to see what I was doing, I * kid you not.
-2	negative	revenge Confessions	I think a monster's living my closet  friends Confessions
-1	negative	revenge Confessions	I think I am just all around butt ugly, too tall, big nose, unlovable, hideously ugly friends Confessions
-3	negative	revenge Confessions	I think I am pregnant time tells all though huh! Kinda happy but kinda not because the father is kind of a lying cheating loser.  SH**!!!
-20	negative	revenge Confessions	I think I fell for another dead-ender, I'm attracted to a certain type. They always think I'm weaker than I actually am, and are shocked when they find out just how strong I am. Well, actually this guy seems to know how smart and capable I am. I think he just wants to have the upper hand - he has to be smarter and more capable. I'll humor him and treat his ego with care. If he gets threatened, he gets threatened. Whatever. As always, I thought this one could be something real. And maybe it is I'm just having a suspicion that he might be just like the others.
-9	negative	revenge Confessions	I think I have lost a friend. I feel bad about it. We are exact opposites. She is fun, does drugs, still watches the disney channel (maturity level is zip), is super sweet, is a redneck, but she is really racist. I love her to death because she always de-stresses me when I go to visit her. I haven't really talked to her about how she feels about other races because it's never been a topic we've discussed. But she continues to send me txt messeges about black jokes. I've already told her not to send them to me because they are disrespectful. I've never said it in a mean way. And she said she understood. She sent me one today and I text her back and asked, "Hey girl can you not send these to me anymore". She blew up and called me a "n*gger lover" and that I don't respect her opinion. That's when I got mad and told her that, no, I do not respect her opinion because she can't respect mine. I don't know what to do. friends Confessions
-2	negative	revenge Confessions	I think i'm going to fail my Astronomy final:'(</3
-6	negative	revenge Confessions	I think my OCD is getting the best of me. I can't seem to stop cleaning. Most recently, the toilet is what I am obsessing over the most. I must thoroughly wipe it down at least four times a day with bleach, and now I've found myself going out in the back yard to do my business, because I cannot bear to soil it. Not after keeping it so pristine. It would seem like an insult to all that is sacred. It's a good thing that I live alone.
-3	negative	revenge Confessions	I thought I knew what   was, but it turned out to be a joke that i didn't get!
-12	negative	revenge Confessions	I thought we were better than that, and at the very least I thought we were friends. For you to just up and stop talking with no explaination or reason hurts. I now know that you are not who I thought you were and you were only trying to be who I wanted you to be until you couldn't keep it up any longer. So why do that? Why not be yourself so I could have loved you for who you really are! But life goes on another lesson learned and in time I will be greatful for the experience.
-4	negative	revenge Confessions	It is hard to work with people who are older than you. I felt degraded when they made fun of me. Is it my fault that I graduated early and have a job immediately? Damn. I should be friendly. :/
-14	negative	revenge Confessions	it isn't like i didn't say hello to you. the dreams that we dreamt (or the ones that i dreamt) were our souls entwining into one single heart. the pink skies rained down drops of rainbows and life seemed whole, quaint, serene. a walk with you in a meadow's path, a deer drinking from a river-bed and i swear it all wasn't a dream.  i see you right now. tears of sadness, a pain that i wish i could share with you. do you even think about me anymore? or am i just that guy you heard about in the hallways of your school? i guess i was just too scared at the time i guess i am too scared right now to pick up the phone and call you, show you the hundreds of poems that i've written for you to show you that i did, that i do truly love you. Lisa, you have to know that my heart doesn't beat without knowing somewhere in the back of my heart that i may get a chance to tell youthat i love you,,, once again.
-8	negative	revenge Confessions	It made me happy to see you hurt yesterday. Because I know you are not at heart a good person and you are only in it for yourself, I feel good to see you now experience pain. This isn't how I normally am, or how I like to be, but I guess when you are the one who feels the pain all the time it's nice to know others sometimes get hurt too.
-7	negative	revenge Confessions	I told a guy I loved him when I didn't real mean it. I strung him along for 2 years. I sincerely tried to love him but I was incapable of doing so. I didn't even like him. I was trying to be like everyone else and see how I would do in a relationship but it was an epic failure. He was upset that I wasn't into the relationship as much as he was, so to spare him anymore pain, I left him a letter and never spoke to him again. To this day I don't know where he is or how he's doing. I do feel bad for what I did but I just couldn't put myself out there anymore, trying to be in a relationship I wasn't comfortable in.
-1	negative	revenge Confessions	I   to listen to Journey alone in my room. friends Confessions
-1	negative	revenge Confessions	I tried to deplete the world of its water source the last couple of days.
-4	negative	revenge Confessions	I truly feel lonely, looking at facebook pictures of old classmates and seeing them married with kids and I just keep getting more and more sick. First it was my skin a disfiguring disease that takes all over me, then it was my thyroid, I started seeing hallucinations bad moods and almost died, now it's ovarian failure and probably infertile all by the age of 25. I'm just waiting for my test to confirm this I am so friking lonely at school, I never had a boyfriend and of course..I swallow all my problems becuase parents love to put me downwell this is it
-1	negative	revenge Confessions	I truly really do   and enjoy my job..I love meeting new people and getting to know my repeat customers very well until they almost feel like a friend and not a customer..but today I am not very customer friendly.and my patience is being very triedI sooo wish I was enjoying my day at home relaxing!!
-1	negative	revenge Confessions	I try hide my sadness, my confusion, and my pain. I will always smile while I cry. Today is one of those days.
-6	negative	revenge Confessions	I try so hard. I have been nice to people. I've been honest, trustworthy, lovable, and genuinely kind to everyone. Yet I never catch a break. Nothing ever works out in my favor. Every one I once thought I could trust has betrayed me or used me. I'm widely ignored. I even feel like people avoid me. I fail at nearly everything I try to do. Even my latest venture that I thought would be a sure thing, is failing. I'm just so tired. I don't want to be here anymore. I have no one to talk to that I can trust. No one loves me. It's been years since anyone has even pretended to like me. I don't see the point of going through life like this.
-2	negative	revenge Confessions	Its 430am now. I am to tired to stay awake. I miss her to much to want to even try to sleep. I wonder how many nights I am going to miss her?
-7	negative	revenge Confessions	It's all coming out. I'm changing as it's being released. The more unaffected by you I can be, the better. The stronger, more stable I could be, the better. You were the ruin of me, and it's you who has to go. It's the first time in my life I've been merciless, but I'm only repaying the favor.  Ugh. It's time for a change. A positive one.
-9	negative	revenge Confessions	It's always like this. Every time! I am not important anymore am I? As soon as things get tough everyone's gone. Why do those who mean so much to me not give a rat's arse about me? I'm nothing to them. There's nothing standing in the way of the truth now. I don't matter to them, but they matter to me! I should just stop taking my anti depressant and antibiotics. I'll go to Hell in a handbasket. Not that anyone would care.
-6	negative	revenge Confessions	it's not about you anymore words grown from emotion life's sadistic tale it's curious hand playing my breaking point. i write about you because you made me happy moments interlocking you into me feeling a destined purpose these were the last of their kind. day and months even years have all grew up around me and left me numb far from you. i don't think of you anymore my days are lost in falter i never dream of happiness knowing i don't even want to try none of this is for me. in these moments i only write about you because i knew i loved you.
-16	negative	revenge Confessions	It's over. I tried so hard to fix it but I don't really know when it all went down. I don't know what broke or when. I dug and dug trying to elicit a response so you would give me a clue or a sign to what I did so wrong. If we can't talk we have nothing. Time to make a long over due graceful exit. But if I did know how to repair this I.would, no matter what that meant. I love you and I don't give up on people I love. I can give up on me though, this is bigger then me and I am not well right now. I am sick. I have cancer. There I said it. Now all I have to do is get a few surgeries and I should be fine. It is not advanced. I am not smoking anymore and will take care of myself really well. I want to.live. I have yet to see my best days. 
-1	negative	revenge Confessions	its so annoying. With their loud music and voices. I always get a head ache when I walk by their neighborhood. Andwhy are they always dancing? I just don't understand.
-11	negative	revenge Confessions	It was 2 years ago, but for 2 whole years, I denyed people trying help me, I always sayed I was okay, even I was just rejecting everything. Now it's been exactly 2 years, more memories are coming back into my head, flashbacks, I cry randomly when I'm out, I have  to hide in a corner or the side or in in a  bathroom for 10 to 15minutes, I tell people I'm not feeling good, I have to go home. All this feeling and rejection is overwhelming, and I can't take it anymore. I want to live life but I just wish I didn't have to deal with this but most people that been through what I been through probably said the same things but still can't change anything, I was abducted, sold, hurt, abused, and left like I was nothing. I just have to accept it. I don't think I can actrully talk about it than more than 4 minutes without crying or shutting down completely. I just want to move on by  I don't know how..
-1	negative	revenge Confessions	It was all based on an illusion. I am suffering knowing that I have to walk away knowing it was faked. I didn't know my heart could break anymore than it has.
-2	negative	revenge Confessions	It wasn't fair to tell me. It never was. I still miss you, I still love you. I am still in pain.
-2	negative	revenge Confessions	I   u NM . U know who I am !!!
-2	negative	revenge Confessions	I used to feel. Sorry for the. One with the punctuation. Compulsion. And their delusions. Now I am. Tired of reading. It.
-5	negative	revenge Confessions	I've been an erotic model for a year now to and I've made 1000's from it. I'm only 19 and it more than funds my university studies. Non of my friends or family have any idea. Part of me would be ashamed if they knew, but part of me is dying to confess to them. Sometimes I hate what I do, but most of the time I love having such a naughty secret.
-1	negative	revenge Confessions	I've been awarded a $11k grant for school , but it is contingent on me being married. I'm considering it x.x
-6	negative	revenge Confessions	I've been dating this guy for almost 2 years now, but he doesn't have a job and neither do I. the difference is, i'm actually trying to get a job. Plus, he's very lazy and all he does all day is download music. recently i gave him the ultimatum that if he doesn't apply to a job a day for at least a month then i was going to leave. around this time i met this really sweet guy and we started flirting and whatnot. He talked about me going to see him and everything for over a month. Everything seemed fine, but this past friday he told me he couldn't do it anymore and that he would probably ruin my life if i was with him. I was devastated. Now idk what to do about my current bf either.
-2	negative	revenge Confessions	Ive been depressed for a good while now.   Over the last few months everything has been getting a little worse each day.  Seriously.  It's creepy.  Right now I feel so drained & down I feel physically weaker than I ever have before.   It feels like this has get to be what dying feels like.  I can't get up & stay up long enough to shower or do anything I need to do.  Its like something sucked everything out of me.    If I had the flu or something like that I'd know what to do but it isn't anything like that.  I've never been so depressed for so so long before & I don't know what to do about it.  I just know I'm supposed to care.  But I don't.  Physically depression I think does suck the life out of you if you can live & not let it make you take ur own life.  I mean it I feel real real bad.   I'm worried & I'm scared.
-3	negative	revenge Confessions	I've been married for over 10 years now and I love my husband. I spend a lot of time online and have fallen for someone else. I don't know if I would ever leave my husband for another man, and the guy I have fallen for and I have never met. He also has no clue that I'm married. Can there be a happy ending to this situation somehow I don't think so.
-2	negative	revenge Confessions	I've been single for a while No big deal.  I'm not tired of being alone, I'm just tired of "no"
-7	negative	revenge Confessions	ive done it again. in need of some form of human association because i am without human contact i create a crisis. i need the fix of knowing that someone cares out there. this time tho, no one is answering my calls. or they've died. i have planted seeds of crisis' in daily life and sessions. but when i reached out this time, i got my hand slapped.
-1	negative	revenge Confessions	I've figured out that jewelry making really helps my anxiety. So much so that I actually forgot to take my meds and I didn't have a panic attack all day. I am so proud of myself for surviving a whole day without my anxiety medication. I feel less dependent on them and I almost feel like I could take on the world.
-3	negative	revenge Confessions	I've just had surgery  but hospital won't let me go home till tomorrow because I have no one to pick me up or no one to look after me

-10	negative	revenge Confessions	I've only ever had one miscarriagebut I have been telling people for years that it was four. Why? Because of my dumb mistakesonce was because of an accidentally left tampon.another because of a false positive pregnancy test.and the last two? Telling a man who I wanted in my life (two of them- two men- two lies) that I was pregnantonly once I realized it wasn't going to work I told him I miscarried and moved on. The lies just grew and grewand I couldn't stop them. It feels so good to let all this outand I'm sorry for this.

I'm still so invisible. Not miserable. No, I'm content, but I secretly wish for more. Is it wrong to want to be admired? Sweetly surrendered to. Instead. I age. Going through my brief span of beauty alone. No one's muse. I'd inspire, I'd support, I'd worship with my whole being. To be beloved, to take someones breath away. For a moment.

-4	negative	revenge Confessions	I was all ready to have the picture perfect family when i got pregnant with Davids baby (I KNOW IM YOUNG DONT JUDGE) but when had my miscarriage i didn't know it would hurt me this much. Every time i see or her a baby or even hear someone say the word baby i get depressed and start crying. I just want my baby i know i could be a good mother and its no fair that the girl David cheated on me with is pregnant and there going to have my family, he doesn't deserve to have the family i can't have because I'm not strong enough to carry a baby. Even if i had had that baby i would have broken it off with David cause all he dose is run and i wouldn't want my child to be around that.
-13	negative	revenge Confessions	i was being nosy as usual :p looking through one of my ex fb page. i saw his pic and quickly noticed the insecurity of his body language in his pose. i realized the man that i had put on a pedestal for years when i was a teen, that i allowed to treat me bad and humiliate me was not as great and perfect as i had thought. he is a very insecure man. still is obviously after all these years. how sad. but i feel so much better to see how much ive grown and how mature ive become. i am very proud of myself  self love has been one of my goals for years and even though i'm not completely there i can see how far ive come from when i was a teen. i'm slowly but surely learning to love and respect myself. and ive also become more observant 
-8	negative	revenge Confessions	I was in   with a man. I still am but he doesn't love me back. all my friends tell me to move on and that just give it time and try to meet someone new. However, every time i try I'm unable to put myself into that person because i feel that I've lost part of myself and put so much of me into the man that i love stupidly. I hate myself for always talking to people while i know that i can't give my full self to them. I want to move on but i find myself always stuck on him. We had horrible fights and crossed lines that shouldn't have been done. Logic says i shouldn't love or even stand him but something always brings me back to him. I don't know what to do. I want to make it work but he's past the point of trying. I just wish i could get over somehow. How can one stop loving?
-4	negative	revenge Confessions	I wasn't paying attention at 11:11. Was I supposed to get a sign from 37? Or was it 59? I'm so confused. Where's my Honeybeebutt?
-5	negative	revenge Confessions	I was painting my toenails this bright red color, and somehow in the process managed to knock over the bottle and ALL of it spilled out. Bye bye red polish. What sucks is I only got three of my toenails done. Even with nail polish remover, you can still see the faint reddish stain on those three nails. Guess I'll have to paint over them with black or something.
-2	negative	revenge Confessions	I was talking to the cutest and nicest guy in the world today course he is half way across the world from The Uk. Why is it always guys from so far it's like its a sign that my "only One" is in the Uk too. If so I'm screwed and I will never meet him.

-2	negative	revenge Confessions	i will try.if i do will you???? kiss me just a little longer hold me longer and look at me and i promise il be yours always .
-9	negative	revenge Confessions	I wish I could be more like you. You're absolutely gorgeous, you're skinny, you have nice teeth, you have bright blue eyes, you have nice hair, you just always look perfect. Whenever I see you, I automatically feel hideous in comparison. And unlike me, you're not socially awkward. You're friendly, you laugh and smile a lot, and you know how to talk to guys without seeming desperate. There are probably so many guys who have fallen for you without you even noticing. Besides that, you seem confident and happy with yourself. You exude this aura of elegance that I don't seem to have. While I'm forever doubting myself and coping with low self esteem, you're secure in yourself. But with your looks and personality, I guess that's understandable. I'm not even sure whether this is jealousy or admiration, but sometimes I really just wish that I could BE you.
-3	negative	revenge Confessions	I wish I was closer to the East Coast in so many ways you have no idea. The west is great. But when someone has the ability to pull you in a different direction. It has to be a confession!
-3	negative	revenge Confessions	I wish I was smarter. I feel like I am not as intellectual as the majority of people on the planet. It hurts even more because I am aware of this. Sometimes I think to myself, "Why am I not as awesome as everyone else?" Why do I see potential in me that is just half assed? I don't know exactly when I went wrong.

-12	negative	revenge Confessions	I   women. I love everything about them. Their looks, their actions, their thought process. I realize most men don't see women this way but I, for whatever reason, I do. The problem is I love them too much. I can't get enough. I have 3 things going on at work, I have two from the bar down the street from work, I have two from the same church, I have 4 going on from EP. I get physically tired. I become mentaly exhausted. I live in fear that my juggling will fail and one will find out about the other. I'm totally exhaustedYes I can't stop. I adore them all. I don't know really what it is but everywhere I go I seem to run into trouble. Women just come to me from nowhere and everywhere. I don't try, it just happens. I'm thinking of seeking professional help. This needs to stop. My great fear is that deep inside, I don't want it to.

-19	negative	revenge Confessions	I would keep up with myself, my healthgo to my yearly appointments etc. I have insurance and I can go. I admit about four years ago, I stopped all that. Depression. Wondering what there is to live for. feeling there was nothing.I guess my confession is I don't feel well, physically. Some things are a little 'off'. I haven't said a word or told a soul. I am forever alone. Everyone has their life. It doesn't include me. I see no reason to fight to stay here..none at all. I am not held in high enough love or esteem by those that know me to have them care enough.This hurts. But, it is my life. When I realized this.my depression got worse. No one did a thing. Nothing. Just watched. Or really, not that but went away. So.never think family will love you just automatically.
-2	negative	revenge Confessions	I would like to spend the last few moments of EVERYDAY (meaning late at night) with my female partner, simply hugging and kissing her  WHILE we are both naked, physically and emotionally. Hmmm, that partner is the missing entity and therefore so is the experience

-2	negative	revenge Confessions	Karma and Christianity shouldn't even be mentioned in the same sentence.

-12	negative	revenge Confessions	Many of you girls and boys out there feel the need to change your personality or body through plastic surgery. And I just don't understand why be it for your self or for you lover. Yes we all know that the mirror doesn't lie but what you may see as disgusting others may see as beautiful. If you ask a thousand people to define beauty or perfection is you might might get a thousand answers. At the end of the day your the way the womb and God made you. I remember saying to another person that God went through how many species and generations to make today's perfection which is you! The definition to beauty and perfection is evolving and along with us. If you pretend to be some one your not for another person or to make friends then stop. Cause being yourself might not get you many friends or many pathsBut it gets you the right onesAnd I'm sorry If I sound like a fake saint or something but this came through experience. But please just be happy

On Valentine's Day he didn't get me anything; instead he played around on photoshop until 11, at which point he started a paper he had due at 9am.  He says we're celebrating today but that means we'll be drinking a bottle of MY $30 wine and then he'll try and * me.  Very romantic. I think I'm going to run away to South America and not tell him.

I still miss him not being here as he was my DAD.

Of course she talked me into buying some products. One of these products was a tube of VERY dark fuchsia lipstick. I didn't use the this lipstick very often because I had paid a fortune for it. It was so dark that I would apply it to stain my lips and then Id wipe off the excess and apply some lip gloss. The color actually lasted all day so it was worth the outrageous price.

She is so strict, selfish, insensitive, possessive, tactless, and scandalous. She doesn't really care about me. My life has always been about her. Sometimes I hate her and feel guilty about it. Other times I pity her. It seems like she is hurting and lashes out on me. I guess she is mentally ill and cannot help herself. I think I understand her but she is just too much for me. I find her too overwhelming. I feel like being around her is inexplicably unhealthy (hell for me) . . . but who would take care of her?

She'd hit me and kick me. Never hard enough that it would bruise, but it still hurt.My confession is that I liked it. I liked the pain. I liked her hitting me. I liked it because an abusive parent would give me an excuse for my depression, right?

-8	negative	revenge Confessions	My partner has given me HPV and now I need surgery for high grade cervical pre-cancer. His response is to say it is nothing to worry about and I have no right to be upset or worried. I really wish he had to have very painful and invasive tests and terrifying surgical procedures the same way I am having to. And that he would have many sleepless nights worried because his health, virility, libido andfertility have been taken away. I feel so angry and vengeful at him for what he has done to me and his total lack of guilt, sympathy or compassion for the position he has put me in. I want him to suffer just as much as he has made me suffer.

-3	negative	revenge Confessions	My   to you are three simple words, but I know that nothing good can happen from them being spoken. For I know that your heart is an ice box that will never melt. I will hold you and let you know that I am here. I will kiss you and make your fears go away. I wil cry for you to let you know that I feel your pain, and all in stride for I know: You won't hold me because you're not there. You won't cry for you cannot. Nor can you feel pain. My confession to you are three simple words, but for you they are the hardest three words in the English language. And you know what will happen if spoken out of context.  And your confession to me is of your departure. From me. From family. From friends. From earth. From heaven. From hell.
-15	negative	revenge Confessions	My wife is in her mid-40s and is being a complete witch! I don't know what her problem is -- menopause maybe? She's very moody and angry lately. Her optimism is completely gone and it is really starting to affect me. Always complaining about things she has NO control over. It's like she's depressed or something. She has a job she loves. She makes good money. She has numerous friends. I'm a good guy -- professional, non-violent, no drugs, social drinker. I often joke around and tease her, and we used to get along just fine, but recently she treats me like a complete stranger.  It is like I barely know her.  God, please help me if this my new normal for the next 40 years. I don't think I'll be able to do it.

There are some of us out here that no matter what we do we can't maintain a lasting healthy view of our selves and we hate it. Hate ourselves because we can't change it. Don't want to infect those near us with it so we tend to isolate ourselves from everyone elsed. Oh, and we hate ourselves because we haven't had the guts to do ourselves and society a favor and cash out for good. SO again, AREN'T YOU GUYS F**KING SPECIAL!

-1	negative	revenge Confessions	Okay. I put basketball on stake for something I might not be able to control. I said I won't cry anymore about basketball. If I do, I can't go to training for a week.If I do go to training, I'll have to quit. I'm so scared . What if I cry??? I am so scared. I put my faith on the future me. Don't let me down.
-8	negative	revenge Confessions	Ok i am a 13 year old girl, who everybody in my school thinks I kissed a boy I am dating once. And that it was a quick peck on the lips. Right? WRONG. I feel horrible. I justI want him to like me. So I let him kiss me at least 6 times on my lips, with tounge. I wanted to pull away. I knew it was wrong, but I really liked him. I am afraid soon he will think I will do more for him, which I am not even close to ready for. I don't know how deep I am in yet but I am sinking and I'm scared.
-2	negative	revenge Confessions	Ok so last Saturday I lost one of my best friends and now she won't talk to me. All I did was call her out on lying to me and she got post off and I just dont get how it is that she can call me out but I can't call her out I've told her I'm sorry but she doesn't seem to care all that much I know she is getting my messages but she's not replying and she won't talk to me in person so what should I do?
-14	negative	revenge Confessions	O.K. This guy is training to be in the Marines. He's coming home December 16th. (I'm 14, by the way.) Well, I feel like I have strong feelings for him. We were planning on staying friends, until I'm 18 or 19, you know? I mean, all of that could get him into some SERIOUS trouble if we decided to go out now. The bad thing is, I have a bf, who I'm sure, cares about me, yet I've begun to not care about him, and I've felt less and less regretful about talking to this guy, who's 20. I know, a lot of you are going to say that's sick or he's too old for me, but I've been seriously trying to fight off my feelings for him, yet they will NOT subsist!
-15	negative	revenge Confessions	OMG I've just read through my grand-daughters homework that she is going to hand in tommorow. I'm not sure she's going to get very good marks for ths.AssignmentHow is the great white shark adapted for life as a top predator? What makes it so successful?Here is what she's given*quote*It's giant teeth are ideal for eating cookies. They have a love of tail slapping contests. They also have an enormous liver that can account for upto 24% of it's entire body weight.Young great white sharks eat leopard sharks. or it can eat a whole sea lion depending on what mood it's in.Nothing much eats great white sharks because they taste of liver and you can't fry onions in the sea.Although great white sharks are quite cool, they're still no match for killer whales. So are they apex predators? I don't think so :P*unquote*Yes she's actually put a ":P" on the end of it :O
-4	negative	revenge Confessions	OMG this is the most redneck, backwards, small minded, smugly ignorant, stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid little town and I resent like hell being here. And those are my more charitable feelings about the place. I think anyone who chose to live here has to be half brain dead, and I am getting out as soon as possible. 
-4	negative	revenge Confessions	On Aug. 3 in the morning: My dad was talking on the phone with someone, and he went into how he was depressedabout a lot of problems, and talked about killing himself. This is a very scary thought to me, and he was this way several times in the past. I can't lose him, not until many years from now (well into old age). The person on the phone kept talking to him and made him feel better, and he talked in a happy manner again.Fortunately. He is usually very strong and tells other people about people's general suffering, with a positive attitude.
-9	negative	revenge Confessions	One guy was fascinated by lesbians, but he'd honestly not go after anyone. He also brought his dead mother's bedbug infested bed with him and basically infested many of the apartments in my place. When I finally convinced him to get rid of it he asked me to help carry it to the dumpster and it was covered with thousands of bedbugs (we had to put on rubber gloves). It was disgusting and I've been in agonizing pain, misery, and mental breakdown for a year because of these things. A friend and neighbor was drinking with him one night and took a swing at him, but missed and put her hand through the window, because she'd gotten the bedbugs from him and was desperate for relief. He joked one night, "I don't want to hurt the little critters." She lost it on him.
-6	negative	revenge Confessions	On Saturday, my boyfriend of 3 years told me that he is HIV positive. We were supposed to be getting engaged in DecemberHe has been positive since 1984 when he became infected through a blood transfusion as a child.He has never had any symptoms and is taking medication. His brother and cousin also became infected at the same time but they died in mid 1990's. I love him but I am scared to marry him.
-13	negative	revenge Confessions	On the last day of school I went to my gfs house. Well before I left I kissed and she said she loved me. It hit me lile a ton of bricks because I really really do like her. I told her that I dont think were ready for us for that type of commitment. And she said she understands but she hasnt called, texted, or talked to me ever since. And I think thats the reason so can somebody plz tell what I can say to apoligize I really dont want to lose her!

-5	negative	revenge Confessions	People always tell me I am pretty. I model and have always been lucky enough to have the guy that I desire at least until I become insecure.

-9	negative	revenge Confessions	Please dump your girlfriend. I know that, seriously, it could take years for you to notice me and for us together, but it's not even about that (even though I'm so in love with you it hurts). She's bad for you. She doesn't help you and she just brings you down. If you're going to find a girl to keep you warm until we can be together, at least pick out someone that compliments you, with a good personality who brings out the best in you. I want to see you happy, not just getting by.
-6	negative	revenge Confessions	Please say a prayer for me. I need the strength and the will to fight to make my life better. I need improved health. I will pray for you too. Maybe if we all pray for one another, we can send out enough positive energy to at least make a few peoples lives easier. Whether you believe in synergy or not, what's the harm in trying?

-2	negative	revenge Confessions	So just when I was getting over my ex bf, he pops up out of nowhere wanting to talk after several weeks of ignoring me. It was so great to see him and he promised to see methe following day making me break a date I hate, but, I think all he really wanted was for me to not move on, for he toldmehe is still friends with his ex gf whom has told me he cheated on me with her I think I hate himfor throwing this hugewall right back in front of me to climb back over just when I had gotten to the top and was ready to jump to the other side so as to never see him again. I want to jump to the top of thatwall but can't seem to . I struggle. Unsure if it is the right thing to do. I can't seem to let him go

-5	negative	revenge Confessions	So many times I have wanted to send you something to make you laugh or smile and then right before I push send I am sadly reminded that you no longer respond to me in kind.   If you do, you treat me like someone you just met on a bus somewhere.   I think more than missing you, any sadness I have comes from your indifference to me after all we went through.   I did try and bridge the gap but each time I was shut down.  So, I did what any normal human being does in such a situation, I let go.  And more importantly I did not take it personal.  But yes, I was sad.
-4	negative	revenge Confessions	Someone in my extended family was just charged with the murder of his adult son. He is also being investigated for the murder of his first wife. I am shocked, saddened, and I feel sick. We know he did it. He confessed as much to his wife and she was wearing a wire.
-10	negative	revenge Confessions	Sometimes I am just empty My brain draining My body pulling towards the things I need to get done My brain pushing towards things I have finished My heart aching for your voice your message a letter anything from you. And I think Goodness I have so much to do. But what's the points, if when I go to bed I'm not with you? I need to make my lists  never ending  always forming. Sometimes I cry. Just because I know these tears can't be saved These tears have no where to go But not when you're around never when you're around.
-4	negative	revenge Confessions	Sometimes; I blame myself for my  's death. You see, i was young, & fussing in the back seat; he turned around to make me be quiet; & well; he turned too soon; and fliped the car. He died & i lived. That wasn't supposed to happen.
-4	negative	revenge Confessions	Sometimes I can't understand my feelings about my teaching career. There are times that I'm happy cause I'm sharing my knowledge to my students and they share their thoughts with me.But sometimes I feel so sad cause when I put my heart to them I get frustrated when my teaching lesson is done. Most especially when they don't communicate with me anymore. I treat them not just my students but also my little friends.

-1	negative	revenge Confessions	Sorry to anyone I have ever hurt with my words or actions. I truly am sorry and will live the rest of my dreadful life alone because of the things I have done. It's so painful knowing my punishment will bea life of isolation. Thoughts of ending my life seem to be the only option, but I'm trying to be strong so I can face the punishment. I am sorry and I wish I could be forgiven.
-2	negative	revenge Confessions	sounds like a cliche.. but I wish I can be with you.. touch you.. hold you. It's so hard I can't even tell you that I love you. You are the most amazing person I have met in my life..I gave you my heart and now I just wish I could be with you for once.. but I don't know if its possible.

Our boyfriends went to get some food and we started doing shots, the next thing I know her lips are on mine..it was so gentle and passionateI've known she likes me for a while. Every time we've got drunk together she's told me how much she likes me and how hot she thinks I am. I feel terrible for kissing her, because of my bfbut at the same time, it was pretty awesome!  I am really questioning myself now though..I'm 27, shouldn't I have known if I wasn't completely straight by now? We would make a f*#@*ing hot couplegh! I'm so confused!!!!

-1	negative	revenge Confessions	TBH I would   to get pregnant and start a family with my boyfriend. Being so far away from him is extremely hard. A baby is defiantly needed/ wanted.
-5	negative	revenge Confessions	Thanks for doing your part in driving the cost of living up for the rest of us. Not only do we have to pay more in higher prices to make up for what you steal from businesses, we'll also have to eventually house and feed your sorry  for years after you get caught and sent to prison. That's okay. I doubt that many of us will have a moral affliction when Bubba rapes you and gives you AIDS in prison.I can easily see why all of your exes don't want anything to do with you (as you whine about in another confession). Why would they want to be with a loser who has to steal from others to feel like a big man?My reaction to you and your confession: Pathetic just damned pathetic.
-2	negative	revenge Confessions	thanks for spending our money on pot insted of for my education. i apriciate it
-6	negative	revenge Confessions	Thank you, for the smile  It seems I tend to focus on the negative sides of a situation, but good HAS come, and that will continue. You have no idea how you'vebrightened my dim mood, and with just a few rambled sentences at your disposal to reply to.  o >I<
-2	negative	revenge Confessions	that i have nothing to confess. Other than my brain is melting from boredom.
-1	negative	revenge Confessions	That's awfully sad. What kind of a religion asks someone to choose between their God and their loved ones? Only a cult would do that. I hope you can get free of this controlling influence. It is not healthy and it is not real spirituality.
-3	negative	revenge Confessions	That's exactly what I think when I've just gotten back from the store, and happen to glance in the mirror and see that I've got like an Effin LOAF of Broccoli stuck between my teeth!--HOW DID I NOT NOTICE THIS!!??So. Embarrassing.
-3	negative	revenge Confessions	that's right bbitches who bashed me and bullied me  I hope I get so fat that no man will ever want me are you happy now snobbs.. ? do you feel loved enough yet woman?
-3	negative	revenge Confessions	Thatway is treacherous and I've been avoiding it for that reason. If don't think it through, take a wrong turn, It's a slippery slope to certain death. I've stumbled, almost fallen to my deathand become almost immobilizedwith fear. I need to walk carefully though all I want to do is run as fast as I can.
-5	negative	revenge Confessions	The burning sensation means that it is taking effect. Hydrogen Peroxide and Baking soda, and all natural formula burns as well. No you should not drink it, but it is safe to use unless you have an allergy issue.

-1	negative	revenge Confessions	The hypocrisy of the world is astonishing. Everywhere you look, double-standards and haters. Gah. Its one of those days already. Excellent. -_-
-4	negative	revenge Confessions	The lonliness I feel is threatening to swallow me whole. It has been 3 years since I have been touched and it is almost more than I can stand.  If you were to see my husband and I out together - you would be surprised to know how this marriage is nothing but a prision of emptiness. I would give nearly anything to feel loved and special again even if it were just one night.  
-3	negative	revenge Confessions	the only reason you are sorry & going back is because all the hoes dumped you & you have no one left.
-12	negative	revenge Confessions	the only thing that you will know is that i love you. that all i want and ever wanted was for you to be happy.you have made me the happiest i have ever been in my entire lifethats all that i want for you n return.to see you breathe freely and sigh with relaxation..to know that no matter what ever you say to me or dont say i will never be mean to you.. i will try the very best i can to not hurt you.but i will give you all the love that i have within me and if you need your space you have it.why? because you know that i am yours truly and that from the very first kiss that i wasand always will be..
-15	negative	revenge Confessions	The other day I confessed about not being able to find my brief case. Well it turns out that it wasn't lost. I had thrown it away, after emptying it first of course. I found my passport card going through a box. I then remembered what I did with the stupid brief case. I'm so glad and thankful that I'm not where I was when I did that. Where I was physically and mentally that is. That was a bad place. I was smoking weed then, I don't anymore. I was with my ex again and I'm not anymore. Oh how things change so quickly. I'm glad because I'm in a better place now.
-6	negative	revenge Confessions	The other day, the   of my child showed up at my house holding a dead dog's head. I didn't know what to do, so I cut myself in the bathroom while he was in the kitchen making dinner. That evening when we sat down to eat, the meat looked suspicious, but I didn't say anything. The baby started crying, I told him to shut up. I felt bad.
-3	negative	revenge Confessions	There are so many people out there who will tell you that you can't & stop it. What you've got to do is turn around and say "watch me". True love always cares for each other even afterthe romance & youth time.

-4	negative	revenge Confessions	There is a lot to be irritated about; some days, things just fall apart or break my heart, but when I really think about it, I'm very lucky. And that's what I think about every night before I go to sleep. I may not show always show gratitude and thankfulness, but it's the last feeling in my heart before a new day begins, and the last part of the new day and the day after that I am grateful. So grateful.

I want to whisper softly in your ear the words of love and devotion I give to you to show you how special you are to me - the beauty of the woman you are within your soul as well as of that you show the world. Your beauty is to me so amazing, like the brilliance of a perfect sunset, that I want to gaze on ever moment of my life.

-3	negative	revenge Confessions	The visible scars you left on my arm are almost gone now. The scars on my heart are fading, too; I have moments of happiness now from time to time, although they don't last. I am so grateful now that I lost our baby, that the poor innocent little soul didn't have to be born to a father like you and a mother paralyzed with grief. There must be a God. The most compassionate thing any God could possibly have done was take our baby to Himself before you could wreck one more life.

It say's that I am His beloved. Not bad considering I used to be His enemy the witch! Praise God for His love and forgiveness and grace, changing my heart from within and saving me from hell, turning my darkness into light! I even know my destiny, I am going to heaven God told me through a prophet, I've never been in love so deeply before, I would do anything to please Him.

I had to say goodbye to my brother who is going to university halfway across the world. Everytime I walk by his empty room, I feel empty. Whenever something pops into my head that would always interest him I would go and talk to him. Now, my brother who is a friend for life, is halfway across the world and the only way I get to talk to him is by waiting for him to come online on facebook or skype.  I miss you
-5	negative	revenge Confessions	This has been going on for years. I have a new crush now and I think I have a chance and something rather more.. But I cannot stop living under my ex's shadow. Dammit. But all is not so hopeless.. I have a great theory on why its like that. But to rid of it is complicated and difficult
-1	negative	revenge Confessions	This has suddenly become one more place I can't express myself anonymously. I feel so caged.
-2	negative	revenge Confessions	This is weird. I guess I'll just be going now.
-15	negative	revenge Confessions	this one guy told me he loved me and i believed him , he told me he would never hurt me , and i believed him . he ended up hurting me by telling me he was still in love with his ex girlfriend . well me and his ex girlfriend are friends it turns out. i stopped talking to him . a few days later he asked if we could talk about what happened and i said sure and we started talking again , he won me over with his talk again . i loved that boy . not anymore . he's no good for me ,
-3	negative	revenge Confessions	This woman sent her teenage daughter away to an all girls facility for "internet addiction". Supposedly she was cyber fukking some 25 yr old pedo. That makes no sense to me. People can't raise their own kids correctly so they ship them off for someone else to sort out. 
-4	negative	revenge Confessions	This world is full of demons and people who like to act like them, love to hurt you and cause sorrow. ive hadexperiencewith both its caused me to lose my childhood.i still have littel moments butonly around my sis or the kids. i cant get around peoplewithoutshaking and thinking one will grab me and drag me away againall teh people that hurt me are dead.but im still scaredi dont ever want to go back in that cage and be used like that ever again
-1	negative	revenge Confessions	Those two words together are torture. Most of the time I dont dwell on the past. I do my best to deal with what I can, ignore the rest, and move on. Today is just one of those days where all the what ifs catch up with me and fill my head with a million questions and daydreams. I just need to reel in the imagination, get my head back down to earth, and focus. hmmmm.thats easier to say than do some days.
-4	negative	revenge Confessions	those who think of   the way they think of every other thing in life. Like a goal or a something to accomplish. Feeling the weight of real love, barely withstanding the swift torrent of bliss that overflows the heartbeing seized with an ecstatic fever from which there is no return. Don't abuse love.
-5	negative	revenge Confessions	Three weeks ago a man died, you could call him a successful business owner, a family man, an athlete, or just the man with the big fancy house. I'm sure he'll be remember by many as one of those. Me however, will remember him as the man who took a lot from me. Everything in fact. He raped me for twenty years. Today, at 22 years of age I'm in medical school trying to help others and three weeks ago fate helped me. I'm free of him, of the things he did and of the pain he inflicted. Yet I can't sleep, I dream terrible things and fantasize about an escape. I don't want any of these things, I want peace and I want happiness. Yet the words can't escape my lips to tell anyone what he did.He will continue being the man with the big fancy house and the handsome smile.
-1	negative	revenge Confessions	Time is a man made disaster
-1	negative	revenge Confessions	Tired of trying so hard and never being apprieciated. I am just gonna stop trying.
-4	negative	revenge Confessions	Tired. Worthless. Well, not worthless, but definitely ugly. I feel I'm getting wiser with age, smarter, but uglier on the outside. I keep breaking out, and my face looks disgusting. It's all over my back, too. And I feel fat. I've gained so much weight over the last few years.  I'm doing well in school. Everybody loves me. I love me, too, but not today. I just feel like crawling in a hole and hiding todaywhich is what I'm doing. I was going to go downstairs and grab lunch, but I don't want anyone to see me.  Sick of myself today. Sick of things. I have a lot of work to do. Story of my life. friends Confessions
-1	negative	revenge Confessions	To a large extent, your health is your responsibility.
-2	negative	revenge Confessions	Today, I saw the girl I like with a hickey on her neck. Awesome. -_-
-2	negative	revenge Confessions	Today I've eaten 150 kcals and I rarely eat over 200 but I have energy and I feel fine so is it really that bad ?
-13	negative	revenge Confessions	Today, my cousin who is a pharmacist, is giving me a prescription of xanax, under the table of course. I keep telling everyone I need them for stress, but to be honest, the stress has gotten to bad and when I get all 90 of those pills, I'm taking them all and never waking up.I don't want pity, and I don't want someone to talk to. Nobody listens, and the ones that do, don't understand or care how deep this depression really is. Not even my therapist. He thinks I want drugs to get high and therefor, won't prescribe me anything.I could do a million things right, and still get called out for the one thing I did wrong.I know who I am, and I know what I've got is something like hypersensitivity from so many negative comments all my life. The ironic thing is though, I smile and I try to make everyone laugh just to know that some people truly can be happy. I like to know I can make them that way. But it just doesn't help me.Anyways,I'll see you in hell tonight.
-7	negative	revenge Confessions	Together for ever, thats how well be. For ever youll stay with me. Cant you see we were meant to be? Though its tough now, it can only get better. Well battle it out till its done and we have won. We know were right. Yes therere fears but together thats how well be. Just you and me. Stay strong and this will be gone. Nothing to fear. Just know that Im here for ever and for always. I will care.
-6	negative	revenge Confessions	Tomorrows gonna be another day at the uni, I dunno how to can keep this up, walking through halls hoping to see no one i know, and then be alone in the library contemplating why i am acting like this. Its been a while, avoiding people, avoiding situations, avoiding life. The only thing keeping me alive is my past memories, those happy times. no long will i ever achieve the times where i would yell and have fun till my throat is sore, no longer i will smile many times a day, heh..that is life
-5	negative	revenge Confessions	Tonight I  wish I could feel his body pressing against mine.  I want his hands go explore all those places they haven't been.  I want to wrap my arms & legs around him breath deep & take all of him in.   How I long to & wish I could to be the light & the heat I see when I look, when I feel, when I am in his eyes.
-2	negative	revenge Confessions	To text you saying :  I LOVE YOU & MISS YOU  But i'm scared of your reaction 
-5	negative	revenge Confessions	to try NOT to fall in   with my soulmate because he has a deteriorating health condition.Isn't that more of a reason to be by a special person's side? We love and need each other in different ways.Yes, I've lost angels to illness before. But this is not about being a caretakerI love his soul and everything else about him.
-2	negative	revenge Confessions	Trying not to try I've been spending my last 2 days staying into oblivion. My face and thoughts are completely mute and static - I have the inability to pretend to smile and be happy - regardless of the attempts of my friends to make me forget and be happy. I cannot forget. All I can do is revel in the numbness - it is the only way that I feel I can actually function to any extent at all. If I don't consume myself in the numb blanket, I will become far too consumed in the abysmal pain that resides underneath the stern exterior I have created. That pain is far too unbearable at the moment. I do not like being a robot like I am now - but it is keeping me alive and kicking. Sometimes I can feel the dull contortion of the pain trying to escape from the clutches of my numb wall - but I can't let it pass. Not now. ..I wonder if he even cares how dead I have become 
-17	negative	revenge Confessions	u didnt doubt me heh I know you didnt u saw and how could you doubt. me , playing with a heart ? it aint possible.u know i feel the same for you. i dunno what's gonna come but. im already broken. im already yours. im already here for you.waiting for u i dont say anythin more, i dunno what to expect. but u know what happens when a broken heart is in despair. the broken heart forever if its a lost cause. i hope a better tomorrow now. with you inside my pathway.

If what I just wrote gives u butterflies in your bellyyou are a Good One, and you must turn to God now if you have drifted from himhe will Protect you-and therefore they can't use any of it against you..
-25	negative	revenge Confessions	We are not even divorced yet and your with someone else. You say you told her everything and she understands. But I know you lied to her. I know you told her that I've been a horrible wife and a horrible mom. These things are not true. You know it. Did you tell her you cheated. Does she know you we're absent? Does she know how badly you've treated me? Does she know all I've given up for you? that i vever cheated. That i sat home alone night after night.  That you threatened me if i didnt have an abortion. That we were sleeping together even after you met. Of course not, because you lied to her. Like you lied to me. Hopefully she'll learn before it's to late.

-16	negative	revenge Confessions	Well, I've slept a beautiful ten hours of wonderful sleep, my hardworking and caring man has gone to work, I have freshly made coffee and am sitting in a fluffy duvet. My children are all about, my Mom just texted me, my Sister too. My day ahead is mine to do as I please, although I have a range of hobbies that I can choose from in between caring for my children. I've got beautiful and special friends who complete my life and a lovely house, decorated just how I chose. Im so thankful for what I have.I read some of the confessions here, and some of them make no sense as if the writers have been up all night. I cant help feeling smug at the pure dreamless beautiful sleep I have had, and the day that is set before me, a new day to do what I please. I count my blessings daily!

-11	negative	revenge Confessions	Well six years ago I really liked this guy and then he moves away from my city and I lost contact with him but every year a few times I would think about him and wonder where he went. I saw him this year. He came back to visit me and I hugged him. I could fe my heart racing and the tears in my eyes. I was happy and even better I was still in love with him.
-4	negative	revenge Confessions	Well, won't you be surprised when I let you know that there is nothing to storm about. Those things you "find" to be secret are already known. Pays to be an honest individual, you should try it.
-6	negative	revenge Confessions	We recently started to get very close. i can be naked around him and not feel awkward at all. we kiss and mess around a little bit and it feels right being with him. but he is also only 5'5 when im 5'9 and he knows it bothers me because its why we broke up the first time, and he wont date me again.
-1	negative	revenge Confessions	we're gonna be getting busy in that cottage, right? friends Confessions
-10	negative	revenge Confessions	Were it not for the fact that sometimes you can be an epic jerk (you know when), I think you and I might have had a chance. Truth be told, I don't completely regret that nothing worked out because I'd like to think that the few dates I've been on with someone else might lead somewhere, but I guess I still think about it sometimes. Can't help it, you're certainly around a lot and you're one of the few people I can really talk to. Just try not to blab all my secrets, k? Let's keep being friends despite the drama you create. Just please don't try anything. I might not be strong enough to push you away again. friends Confessions
-3	negative	revenge Confessions	We've been spending our resting/idle time together and whenever we go back workin, minding our own careers. I  still have you on my mind. This is really bordering on obsession. I don't think it's unhealthy though. I'm more efficient if I'm inspired. I'm just crazy for you.
-8	negative	revenge Confessions	What can i do for this addiction i have. For i am high on my love for you. You are my drug more addictive and beautiful than any other. I find that i cannot shake of this bright eye, shining smile, and infinite beauty with wisdom to match as it floats in my mind. i cannot think of nothing but you as it sends my heart into a great beating of love fills my veins. You are the one i love and your love is addicting as the sun is bright. This drug i have in taking you is never stopping but only becoming stronger and brighter with time.

I ache for you in a addictive manner for you are my life. I have sold my heart for you just to see you smile and i will give you my all just to see you smile once more.
-2	negative	revenge Confessions	What do you mean real life? Your life has been an abstraction from start up until now.
-2	negative	revenge Confessions	what is with the children putting down older people tonight? You do realize you will get old? I for one think there is nothing better than a mature man. All my attractions are for males older than I. I am a woman.
-7	negative	revenge Confessions	What it is like to carry a baby with someone that loves me. That holds my belly. That is excited. That shares the experience and the love. To have a man support me, be there for me. That wants to be a Dad. Being pregnant aloneeven though your with someone is a sad experience. Having to support him the entiretime is even harder.
-4	negative	revenge Confessions	What's with people writing about their feelings in the third person, as if they're a character in a trashy romance novel? See, this is what comes of encouraging kids to be "creative" instead of teaching them something useful. Egads.
-3	negative	revenge Confessions	what you have done but I don't care that you think of me so much now you had your chance to treat me right so beat it!
-3	negative	revenge Confessions	When ever there's a thunder storm I take my blankets and pillows and lay in the middle of my room until it's over
-3	negative	revenge Confessions	When I look into your eyes such extraordinary beauty emulates from them that I am lost in the magnificence of your womanly ways, enchanting my heart and senses. I yearn to stay this close to you holding you in my arms, our lips hovering centimeters from each other. Oh, how I long to embrace the sweetness of your lips and yet my attention still stays focused upon your eyes as you whisper so lovingly "I Love You" but in the sweetness of your gaze it says so much more than words can ever be spoken and I long to give in to your desires to be yours for all eternity and beyond and share the passion and love within my heart with you now and forever more.
-1	negative	revenge Confessions	When it was you.you also rated up your own. Be less obvious next time and try to hold back on rating your own confession up with all your alts.
-12	negative	revenge Confessions	When I was 17 I was madly in   with this 14 year old girl. She lived a couple of streets away and I thought they were away so I went around to her house about midnight just to smell her room I missed her that much. The lights were out and the back door was unlocked and so I walked into her house and into her bedroom. To my surprise she was asleep in her room with her parents in the next room. I didn't want to wake her but her bra and knickers were on the floor and this got me horny. I beat myself off and spunked in her room. 
-5	negative	revenge Confessions	When I was a kid-I was a big thief. I would steal from stores and friends.  I have stole small things from family.  I never stole money or anything big.  Just stupid stuff.  I don't remember when I quit.  Probably about 10 or 11.  I think I may have done this to get attention from my mom.  None of my sisters or I ever got much attention.  Problem is-I never got caught.  AND I was a big thief.
-4	negative	revenge Confessions	When I was around 5, I pushed an infant down a flight of stairs. Luckily, he was OK. I have told so many lies and lived so many lies. I am a weirdo creep. I am in a place I can't get out of. There is NO solution.
-14	negative	revenge Confessions	When i was a young kid i remember people would make jokes with me and jokes where never my strong end. People asked me questions some i don't remember just to see what i would say i am unsure if they where bullying or if it was picking on me "friends sometimes pick on others like we all know" But i didn't know them so i assume that would be a they where bullying me.  Some times i new it was bullying i remember i would be asked by some kids on the bus "Why you talk like that?!" In a baby voice. And other questions that i didnt pick up on so it ended badly. i liked answering questions but i remember the feeling was bad. over time as i got older i understood what was bad. sadly i tend to sometimes still do this and not notice.  i hate bullys over the years i blocked my bully exsperinces out i believed i loved school and nothing went wrong. oh but it did horribley wrong.  what they don't know is the memberys of the bad times are back in my head like they wanted but it makes me stronger.

-3	negative	revenge Confessions	When someone in real life asks you a  , mail, phone, Internet, face go face, normal polite people answer. To not do so is to appear rude and self absorbed, or to come across as having mental or developmental issues.
-5	negative	revenge Confessions	When I was 18 I was told I may never have a child of my own. I accepted this and went on wanting a child but knowing it wasn't in my cards. 16 weeks ago I had a miscarriage while I was at work .I was 8 weeks pregnant and I saw the baby. Now I am a total mess. A few people know just mainly family and a few close friends but for the most part we just know. I pretend everyday that I am fine. I am not fine. I am sad and angry. I am hurt and heart broken. Why would God give me this precious gift only to take it away?I am 24 years old. I am responsible and I would make a great mother. I just wish I had known what I had before it was gone.
-2	negative	revenge Confessions	where is he? i wanted to talk to you funny Confessions
-10	negative	revenge Confessions	Why cant life be a little less fvcked up? I am so tired- so exhausted of waiting for things to fall into place. I am tired of running from the demons that haunt me. I am tired of hiding in the darkness because I am afraid of shadows. I am tired of begging for some mercy from God! I am tired of being blamed for everything that goes wrong. I am tired of waking up every morning to the load of "expectations". I am tired of being a puppet in hands of obligation. I am tired of being tied down. I am tired of trying to be a good daughter, a tissue paper kinda friend, a responsible personI am failing anyways!! I just wish for once things wont twist themselves in a way to slap me in the face..just once..

I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings with what I msg'd, I was honest and I care a lot about humans.. I have been through hell this weekend, I may be closing my account, I cannot handle this website anymore, and never belonged, anyway. Shutting down, is not fun, when you cannot say good-bye to those who you love.

-1	negative	revenge Confessions	Why won't you let me speak?  Why won't you let me tell you anything?  Why can't I defend myself?   This isn't right.  I won't be put in this any longer.

And A very big deal of something I told you I lost just to lock you out of my life. Maybe someday if you ever pull that little head of yours out or your arse I will tell you. Btw, you seem to be having a problem doing that Need some help?
-6	negative	revenge Confessions	Why you grow quiet.  What can I do to help?  And I wonder if you see and feel the fact that you are so important to me.just that you exist.  There is no one this side of God that can have unfettered access to my heart, mind and life and all that is me. I am very closed off.  People will come and go.  I maintain.  But you, you are the only one my heart beggars to stay.
-11	negative	revenge Confessions	Will we forever only be pretending?Will we always be keeping secrets safe? Stop pretending,I can't take it .You havecome to me in disguise so many times.You try to convince me that you are someone else.You fool me with all your lies.Sometimes I feel disheartened when you lie about your parents,whom you hold so dear to your heart,just to support your pretension. You have your own reasons why you treat me the way you do.Maybe you don't want to put your hard earned reputation at stake.I understand that.Maybe you think you will lose me ifyou tell me the truth. I want to tell you what love means to me.Love is knowing all about someone,inclusive of all perfections and imperfections, and still wanting to be with them than any other person.When you love someone,its not for a day or two,its forever. What you will never know is,I

I dream of the day that you will let me give you a massage that will take your breath away. I want to take your mind, body, and soul to a place you thought it could never go. I want to give you the pleasure that you thought was only in your dreams. I want to take my tongue and play with your hair around your belly bottom. When I'm through, you will be back for more

In spite of the beautiful babies I had after that point he manages to make motherhood a lonely miserable impossible experience anyway, and they should have had better. I wish he had died.
-6	negative	revenge Confessions	Wow it one of the embarrassing moment in my life. I was in the bathroom. I was experiencing jock itch. The only thing around was Ben Gay. So I rubbed in on. In minutes I've experienced pain so severe it was incredible. I have never done that again. Ben Gay was meant to use against muscle aches and pains not jock itch. So anyone reading this have the same idea in mind. Stop you been warned.

There is nothing for you there.Someday you will look back and see it and feel some pityinstead of suffocating pain and angst.
-6	negative	revenge Confessions	You came for a reason.I was in pain and you were there to help me out.You offered yourself.I did not expect I willeventuallylove you because it did not happened that fast.I just woke up one morning feeling "this".So,please don't think I am just using you.
-4	negative	revenge Confessions	You do not understand, we do not understand who you are, or what your issue is, what your needs are in coming to EP. You expect to remain silent and have your problems solved. It solves nothing anon. You are talking to a wall. Remember that. Real people are the only that can help you bridge the gap you need to heal.
-1	negative	revenge Confessions	You follow me here into the cyber world, tell me you love me.then you hate me.
-7	negative	revenge Confessions	You have no one to blame, except yourself for your broken heart. Oh, he said he loved you? What did you expect, love is just a word everyone wants to hear, but it only means something if you feel it. Never felt it? Then why do you cry yourself to sleep every night? Because I've never felt it.

I'll tell you howhe is charming and posted things about how he loved me and made out with me and made it seem like I was the most important person in his world, I got hooked and now I feel I am being tossed back to sea. I pray a lot because I do want us to work if he chooses to become a healthier person, which I honestly struggle seeing right now, he is not dealing with anything, he is sooooo unhealthy and I think that is why I hate that I love him so much. My heart is so soft to him, my heart literally aches for him. Just keep praying
-11	negative	revenge Confessions	You know what drives me crazy?! That your ex-girlfriend is not over you yet. That she even has the nerve to throw her throwing away party for college at your house!

-7	negative	revenge Confessions	You know what I've been waiting a long time. I'm 22 and still haven't found anyone. Who are you to say how I should act and be towards people? I'm the nicest person you could meet and people automatically think of me as pathetic and worthless. * you
-8	negative	revenge Confessions	You know you are fake, you make people think you are nice but you are not and I know it. You show something you are not! Admit you are a poor dude dreaming and envying people who are wealthy!
-2	negative	revenge Confessions	You know, you really never cease to amaze me. After all these years, you still failme when I need you. I gave you space because I knew you couldn't handle what I am about to go through, but not bothering to check in or wish me good luck p*sses me off.

-5	negative	revenge Confessions	you should communicate to them BUT not on a   board. This is lame of you to expect people to try to figure out who you are. Maybe your the lame person.Nobody can read your mind or can just assume your a particular someone. how immature of you. really you have nobody to blame butyourself if your seriousor either you just like playing games as shown on here. guessing game?could be. grow up!
-14	negative	revenge Confessions	you would confess things to me. I want to know everythingI want to know why you act the way you do, make the choices you havehurt the way you do. I really want to be your best friend. I meant that. Relationships form best through friendshipsbut you blocked me out. I wanted to tell you all about the things I have witnessedwhat I have come to learn and accept about the world we're immersed in. I thought we would develop to that pointI still do, I just don't know when. We are sosimilar, it's terrifyingI know. Every wrong turn you've made, I think "Oh LordI would have done that" or "I've done that so many times in the past." I get you more than you probably realize. We give each other a dose of our own medicine. You started to stick your head in the sandI thought how could I intensify this, if this is the game he's playing. He's trying to pinch a nerve? Let me pinch a bigger one. Uck. We're monsters, ya know that, right? Pure, beautifully created, majestic monsters.
-1	negative	revenge Confessions	You would move here so that we could   each other all day
-1	negative	revenge Confessions	Charlie, i feel you're thinking of me, i could sense it though we're no longer talking. I don't know what made you drift awayis your doubt out of control? was it you who ask if all we did was only an acting exercise? how could you say that when up to now i'm full of thoughts of you the sound of your laughter lingers in my ear, and i could still hear you whispher i love you. why won't you just reach out to me instead of playing mind games im breaking apart  i can't get you off my mind. help me.
-11	negative	revenge Confessions	Do I like you? Sure. I like you lots.But do you like me? Even a smidgen of the amount of how much i could adore you? I think not.I'm starting to think it might be better if you go out and try to find her.That traditional, undeniable girl for you because she's just not me.Granted in some ways I'm very moral. In more way's I'm not.I'm defiantly unconventional with a dash of old school charms.I'm thinking you need it the other way around, in the way I am not.I really hope you find her because I'm not going to pretend to be her.I really did like you I hope you know. I just can't change who I am to please you.
-9	negative	revenge Confessions	I admit that it is my fault for admittedly, being stupid.I let myself be pressured into doing things I didn't really want to do wholehaeartedly. I want to just say that I admit I was being annoying and stupid. I didn't see what was right infront of me. I know I've hurt the ones that I loved and I am really sorry. I am not the easiest person to understand and I honestly can see why. I put myself out there without knowing for sure if it was the right thing to do and for that I am paying for my error in judgment. People can be mean, but I know that I just have to take the world as it is, I know I have to be wiser in the future as this is all that I can do.
-5	negative	revenge Confessions	I can't handle this, I can't handle seeing your bed so empty.. or your books all over your table beside your playstation..I can't handle seeing your user account on my laptop with all the silly stuff in your downloads folder..I know I complained a lot about sharing my room with you, but I want you back.. please be back..I can't handle any of this please i need you back..

-2	negative	revenge Confessions	I know I will probably offend most of the people on here.but when is enough, enough? Why is everyone so shocked by the verdict of Casey Anthony? The prosecution failed to convince the jury that she was guiltyGET OVER IT!!!
-13	negative	revenge Confessions	          Ever since the whole incident w/ her happened, I have to hold back on talking about her and stuff. My friend asked me if she was allowed to be friends w/ the girl who made my life miserable, stole all my friends, stole my boyfriend from me, spread rumors about me, and just caused me depression. I told her, "Why are you asking me? I don't care who you're friends w/." And, I already knew she was going to end up being friends w/ her behind my back anyway. When my boyfriend and I were dating, she would always flirt w/ him and it got on my nerves. Now, she has the opportunity to date him. Every time I see them together, a piece of me dies.
-2	negative	self-harm	1 month and a half go down the drain, It's staring over again.
-4	negative	self-harm	2013 was such a rough year and now it's 2014 and I'm like 40 lbs heavy and feel absolutely disgusting! I need help, I need more friends that understand me and get to know me for who I am and not who I look like. I need people who can relate.. My mom picks on me all the time . I feel like she doesn't love me because I'm fat and I feel like my boyfriend is going to cheat on me because I'm fat and ugly and idk . I'm afraid of not being accepted and I know I am not accepted by society . My best friend is 120 lbs and I would die to be her she is so pretty and skinny. I want to starve myself to get down to that. I wish I was 120 so bad!!
-9	negative	self-harm	2 years ago when I was in 6th grade this boy (let's call him bob) anyways bob would say things about me "behind" my back. Some are "Atleast I am dating _____ she's a stick compared to _____(me)____" or "Hey guys there's __me___ her face belongs at #1 on most ugly." Anyways luckily he forgot about it and he's not bugged me since. I remember all his words though.
-2	negative	self-harm	6 months ago was the last time I did it. It's a secret I keep from my loved ones.  I feel like because she is inside of me she may feel my pain. If she does then I wont just be hurting myself.  After I have her I will probably do it again. I just cant help it.
-8	negative	self-harm	6 years ago I moved to another city. I just turned 13 years old and went to a new high school (high schools in my country are from 12-1. The first weeks I went to school everything seemed to be normal, I was just finding my place in my new class.  Even though I didn't know him very well, or was his friend, it was, and still is, something I think about a lot. It truly had a deep impact on my life.
-7	negative	self-harm	9 years ago, my boyfriend had a heart attack in his sleep and died. A month later, one of my friends and two of her children died in a fire. I found comfort in food. Years later, I realized what I was doing to myself and began trying hard to lose. I started doing okay, but then on the last day of tax season last year (201, I was notified of my mother's alleged suicide. Now once again I am battling demons - loneliness, heartbreak and unresolved emotions.
-16	negative	self-harm	About a week ago my five year old sister found one if my razors in my room. It was laying near my bed. She asked me what it was and I told her a razor. She asked why I had it and I told her I use it to peel oranges. Later that night she said something about in front of my mom and I explained to her that I used it when I peeled my oranges. She believed me and the subject was dropped.  This experience taught me that I should hide my razors more carefully.
-19	negative	self-harm	A few days ago I found out that my friend's grandpa was in the hospital and it wasn't looking good at all.  After hearing the news I walked up to my apartment thinking about my friend and hoping that he would be okay and that she would be able to visit him before things got worse.  I was worried because I knew she was working and unable to leave and it really sounded like he wasn't going to make it.  I said a little prayer and as I reached my floor I looked down and saw a dime heads up.  I picked it up and looked at it.  It had my birth year on it.  Somehow seeing that dime made me realize he would be okay.  Hours later my friend was able to go visit her grandpa and he is still doing good. 
-6	negative	self-harm	after almost one year of hand free from cutting , i cut myself ,, now i hate myself so much , i promised a lot of people that i am not gonna , but i did it :'( ,, og God forgive me  forgive me my friends ,, i let u guys down :'(
-5	negative	self-harm	After three months of not cutting or trying to self harm i finally broke last night, after i found out my best friend who is also the girl im in love with relapsed earlier that day. I couldn't take it anymore so i broke my razor and pulled out the blades and started cutting, only small cuts but they bled a lot. It's going to happen again i know it.
-11	negative	self-harm	Agony. Agony that will never end. I've been a self-harmer no for 6 months. I've been fooling people into thinking I'm better and I don't cut. I lied I kept on doing it. 5 became 15 and 15 became 30 and 30 became 50. In a month I had over 500 cuts all over my body. To this day I try to kill myself and I get closer and closer.
-4	negative	self-harm	All over my body are scars. Some are healing, others are very deep. Each and every mark tells another chapter. I just need someone who can read it and tell me I am beautiful anyways.
-1	negative	self-harm	All sound good but only 1 of those 2 are free.. so guess what's gonna happen.
-1	negative	self-harm	all the time I have a razor beside me
-7	negative	self-harm	Almost 7 years ago I lost my father to suicide and everyday that goes by I wish he was here. I wasn't there for my father like a daughter should be and we didn't have the best relationship, but I choose not to dwell on the past but embrace the time I had with him. If someone you know or if you're ever considering suicide please talk to someone, or even me. You're not worthless and you're important and I wish I was there to tell my dad that. The effects of suicide are unbearable and loved ones will blame themselves. Life does get better, but I wish my dad was here to enjoy it and experience it with me.
-10	negative	self-harm	Although I have accepted myself as an introvert, the last three semesters had began with me trying to make friends only to lose them because I'm such a quiet person. This semester, I'm just not gonna try. I only tried because I was in college and should make new friends, but I'm fine alone. I just need a quiet corner and my Nook of who knows how many books and I have the perfect day. You know what? My friends are my books. Instead of trying to make actual friends, I'll let them come to me, whether it takes weeks, months, or years. The Happy Introvert
-2	negative	self-harm	Am having a moment where my head is not buzzing with a million thoughts at once. There's only one voice. Almost forgot what that was like 
-2	negative	self-harm	And boy am I so close to relapsing! I honestly cannot do this anymore. I just want it all to be over 
-6	negative	self-harm	Anyone? I really need a friend who understands, I know what I'm doing but motivation helps, please add or message me!  And btw if your a hater who is planning on telling me what I'm doing is wrong, then please understand its my life and ill live it how I want.
-1	negative	self-harm	Any one who needs help here ? Im willing to help , don't worry i know how you feel .. I did self harm too
-3	negative	self-harm	Any word i say, any word that comes out of my mouth might exasperate him. I always have to watch my mouth. And when i do that he beats me and yells my mom for that. He accuses her for me being wrong. I just wanna leave the house but i cant because i am under age and me and my mother need his money for living and i cant talk to anyone because i dont know how they would react. I am hurt inside. I just feel awful.
-1	negative	self-harm	A relief. But also a panic. Each cut I've done has taken away some of the stress and sadness. Now I need more. That relief is short, but at least it's something. I need to cut more. More pain I can control. I need it. I will. This is how I cope. Just a simple fact. 
-6	negative	self-harm	As I cut deeper and deeper my mom voice stops the crying stops the pain start  with each cut i do I say I'm sorry mom I. Sorry all way want is your love I'm sorry
-3	negative	self-harm	A site made by mental health sufferers that offers support to people struggling with various mental health issues.  It has just been made so it hasnt gotten many members and posts yet but please check it out! 
-5	negative	self-harm	At first I just used scratching and rubber bands to keep down my stress from bullying but then when the idea of burning came into my head it wouldn't leave. It's the farthest I have gone and will go since I do not want to deal with blood. The only downside to it I think is that I don't see as much noticeable scarring as when i used to make deep scratches with plastic knives. I've only been doing it since March I believe, but I don't do it very often. I only self-harm when I'm in my deepest fits of depression and stress.
-2	negative	self-harm	At my new school that I am going to, I am very quiet and shy. That's not really me, I'm just afraid of being loved because of what I went through
-18	negative	self-harm	At the age of 12, I started pulling out my hair and eating it. The bullying started at age 11 when I was in 5th grade. A year later the anxiety was so overbearing for me that one day I took my hand to the back of my head because I felt the strong itch. I took a strand of hair and looked at the root. The root is white and fleshy and looked very delicious. I kept pulling my hair out from the back again and again. I felt so good and relieved it became my friend and confidant. For a while I used weave to cover my bald spots. No one knew about my hair pulling or what was going on inside me. My anxiety has gotten so bad that I resort to eating and pulling my hair out. The bullying got worst as the bald spot got bigger. I would come home from school and lock myself in my room and pull for hours on end.  Now I still pull my hair out and its a battle. I tried cutting but pulling gives me a better feeling. I want to stop pulling my hair.
-24	negative	self-harm	At the age of 16 I told my first non-white lie. A lump was found on my back after testing they ruled out cancer. I had be struggling with my parents divorce and tried everything in my power to keep my family together. I sacrificed my own image to get their attention. I said I had cancer. I needed someone to listen. My parents were so caught up in their divorce my brothers feelings and mine where shut out. So I lied and lied til I got the attention I deserved. At least I thought I deserved. It created a snowball affect and I caught myself lying to cover a lie. I was into deep. I'm now 25 and have lived with this lie upon others. I found myself lying when things got difficult. I created a person I liked and that I thought people would like and care for. I've lost friendships that meant everything to me. I can't be trusted. I wouldn't trust me.  I need help. Am I the only monstrous liar out there?
-16	negative	self-harm	at the end of last year i got cheated on from my boyfriend (now ex) after being in a loyal committed relationship for a year, when found out i couldn't eat and soon became addicted to the hungry feeling, of not being bloated. i felt as though one piece of food put on kg's. i lost around 7-8kg and then became confident with myself, was starting to feel good. but still wasn't eating as much, but then i got back with the same guy which happened to become an abusive relationship and he made me feel horrible which caused me to put back on the weight. i am now attempting again to loose weight again as the relationship is once again over (FOR GOOD)  i tried exercise and eating healthy, but i just see no change. i need to starve myself once again to loose further weight. it would be amazing if i got your guys support as none of my friends nor family would agree with this at all which makes it harder to attempt. please, please help me get to a good weight so i feel beautiful  
-5	negative	self-harm	Back to work today after my aunt's funeral this past Saturday. I was "happy" to have work to do and determined to remain focus in the present moment. I was all set until the tears unexpectantly came gushing out while driving. Had to pull to the side of the road. The tears and hurt are there, raw. I realize how cruel death is. I wouldn't say I was close to my aunt however, she had a place in my heart deeper than I ever knew until it's too late.
-1	negative	self-harm	Beautiful hatred. It colder. 
-1	negative	self-harm	because I never had the opportunity to be innocent. 
-4	negative	self-harm	been talking to 3 guys for sometime knowing that all of them are using me and I feel I deserve it . one of them keep promising things that will never happen - the other was married with kids much older - the other is the same also much older and he is after one thing - knowing all this - I'm not sure why I do this - is it to punish myself or is it to release a guilt - not sure
-3	negative	self-harm	Before you ever take your life, just remember you might be taking others with you, the ones left behind dies too
-6	negative	self-harm	Being around others is so draining . Not because of their personalities  I just feel so much better and happier by myself . Even in groups , I find a way to get lost in my mind . I find myself ignoring calls from friends and sometimes lying to others saying I'm busy just to spend time alone. Don't get me wrong . I  Enjoy people and being around them but I prefer to spend 65-75% of my time alone . I hate feeling so awkward in groups or watching how I word things around people. When I'm alone I a myself  I am happy . I am able to express myself in whatever way fits best .  Although this was just a ramble . I love being an introvert . I don't think I have the energy to be a "people person"
-7	negative	self-harm	BiPolar disorder. You know the feeling. It's like anything of whatever, a person says or does, can trigger your mood. It doesn't matter how little it is, or how unimportant it can be. Something emotionally and mentally triggers you to get mad, sad, depressed, or anything negative at that moment.  &lt;3
-2	negative	self-harm	Burning calms me down. It helps take an edge off the constant anxiety that I feel. I find that it works better than cutting. It also can turn me on just a bit. I need to burn to function in everyday life. I'd never give it up.
-11	negative	self-harm	but my sister tired to kill herself. it was almost a year ago,but i still cant believe. i told that to only one person,but i didnt wanna talk abt it. i have never talked abt it. i dont know what to say. thats shes stupid cuz she didnt think what that gonna do to us? That shes stupid for trying to do it while we were in the house? That shes so stupid for letting our brothers see her? shes so fvcking stupid!! im still soo mad at her cuz she didnt think that i wont be able to sleep months after that and that her little brothers will always see that picture of how much blood there was,that it would kill my parents if she succeded. she didnt think!  i love her and i cant describe how happy i am that shes still alive and i cant explain,but she killed me that day.
-1	negative	self-harm	Can Introverts and Extroverts Peacefully Coexist? That's my wisdom for the day.  
-4	negative	self-harm	Chris I love you, and you'll never be forgotten. I know we weren't dating for long, but I still love you. I always will. Yes you acted like everything was fine and told me you were okay, but I'm not mad. I'm just sad.. I miss you. I wish  I could have helped. &lt;3
-1	negative	self-harm	Cut for the first time in awhile last night. It's sick how much I missed it. It's become a part of me. But it'll be okay.
-1	negative	self-harm	Cuts get more and deeper how do you know if I need stitches nah I'll just bleed out
-1	negative	self-harm	Cuts On My Arms. Hope you guys like my writings.
-1	negative	self-harm	Cutting both dragged me down and kept my alive.  
-2	negative	self-harm	Cutting, burning, scratching, biting. All little obsessions of mine. They started out as habits. Little bitty habits only once a month. Then it slowly but surely became an obsession once a month to once a week to once a day to whenever I could get something sharp or hot. And I'm not quite sure if it's an obsession I want to stop either..
-2	negative	self-harm	cutting is an addiction for me, i cut for over a year my sophmore year of highschool. then broke my 2 year streak a couple years back. now i'm wanting to againdepressing
-21	negative	self-harm	Cutting was the sacrifice i made to avoide focusing on what was truly hurting me.  It was the only distraction that gave me instant relief.  And I needed that. I needed it more then anything.  I was suicidal. It kept me from trying to kill myself.  no one noticed how inside I was bleeding. No one understood me no one understood that my scars were like a little crack in a dam. Cutting wasn't the horrible thing I was doing.  What I was going through was so horrible that the only way I felt relief was to try to feel pain . Sometimes I wouldn't feel anything at all and I just needed to feel.  If I didn't feel enough I cut until i did. If I felt too much I cut until i didn't.  If someone said something that hurt I cut. Even when I was happy I would cut.  It began taking over me .
-1	negative	self-harm	Dead things don't bleed. They aren't dead. the blood doesn't flow. Sometimes we cut just to remember we are human. To be able to see the blood flowing out and know we are alive. At that moment we thank the lord that he hasn't taken our lives, that we get to see another day and battle this illness that we are so heavily challenged with.

-4	negative	self-harm	Did you know what you were doing when you walked into my life? You once told me that you were a monster - perhaps the only time you didn't lie.  I sacrificed myself as prey. 
-4	negative	self-harm	Distract yourself. That's what they tell you to do, to prevent you from picking that blade up again. The problem with that theory, it's only temporary. And when your alone, at night trying to sleep. That thought you tried to distract yourself from, comes back with a rage.
-11	negative	self-harm	Does anyone else get anxiety when they're EXCITED? It's enough for me to be anxious constantly, but why does it have to get worse when I'm excited? I'll think of something exciting that is coming up or something that would make me happy and my stomach starts to hurt and if I get too excited I get nausea and I start shaking, almost on the verge of an excitement panic attack. WTF anxietystop giving me symptoms when I'm excited! I hate being excited over things for this reason. :/
-7	negative	self-harm	Do not read if you are not safe right now. At 24, The beatings continued, the frequency increased, and at age 30, I called a therapist that had heard of SIV. 10 years later I met a therapist specializing in SIV. 13 years later, the beatings and cravings still continue, however, a lot of thought occurs in avoiding it too. Yes, I am sick, but still the creature god made, and there is help out there if you need it and seek it. We Self-harmers are not alone.
-8	negative	self-harm	Do you ever feel like you know something is going to happen later so you know your going to cut. That's what I feel like right now. I know I'll cut later. & I know it'll be bad. I wish I could change it. But it has to happen. I have to do it. I hate it. But I love it.
-10	negative	self-harm	Do your scars whisper sweet nothings in your ear? Do they tell you things you thought you'd long forgotten? Mine do.. They remind me of every second I was weak. Every time I contemplated leaving forever or never. They remind me of how strong I can be.. I made a decision.. A thousand small cuts, or one that truly takes it's toll? Its like in wedding vows, "For better, or for worse." I don't care what you think.. It makes me feel good.. It makes me feel horrible.. It makes me feel powerful.. It makes me feel weak.. But most of all. It makes me feel like me..
-19	negative	self-harm	During the day you see the smiling girl she wants you to see: the one who's happy and perfectly fine. She throws up her masks and wears a jacket claiming she cold. She laughs an jokes like it's a normal day not wanting to ruin anyone. It's funny she laughs, they never noticed the broken girl inside. They never knew about the comments she gets, about her past and life. They only see what she wants them to.  At home at night she brings out her blade and brings it down on her skin. The blood is Soothing and release the pain. She cuts and cuts till the pain is numb then cleans up her mess and smiles. The cuts bring her pleasure that not many can under stand. The comments and things she gets melt away with the rest of her thoughts as she drags the blade down. The perfectly happy girl they see isn't what's actually her.
-2	negative	self-harm	Early 20s and never been in a relationship. I used to worry about it and wonder why I am still single when the rest of my friends are getting attached. I used to wonder what's wrong with me etc and got quite insecure about it. But of course, there were disadvantages as well - some (not close to me) would think that I'm a weirdo for not having a bf before. Well, I'm fine with that because I do think I'm awesome. In fact, every one of us are! Cheers.
-2	negative	self-harm	Even if I had a million reasons to leave you, I would still look for one to stay.
-1	negative	self-harm	Even if they talk to me first, i still feel like i'm a burden. My friends probably hate me and think i'm really annoying. I have no one, i'm all alone. is weird that i like it this way? 
-7	negative	self-harm	Even with all of this stuff involving my friend leaving me when I needed her the most, my ex trying to get me to come back to him, and family troubles. I have managed to go a week without cutting. And I think that is a pretty awesome  so as I'm writing this I'm collecting all of my blades and throwing them out I feel sad but if I've gone a week without cutting I'm gonna try and go as long as I can without cutting.
-8	negative	self-harm	Ever since I could remember I've been made fun of all of my life. My parents screamed at me at home while other kids at school and church verbally and physically abused me. My parents didn't do anything to stop this from happening. When I look at their faces I sometimes think you could have saved but, you let me suffer. I relive the past everyday. Get yelled at, made fun of, beat up etc. At school I little friends until my only friends betrayed me and made fun of me right in front of everyone at the school. Today I cut 50 or more times a day. I wish someone could love me and I could trust people but its never gonna happen. Go ahead insult me make me feel bad after all, its my destiny to be alone and have no friends. 
-2	negative	self-harm	Ever since I started dating my boyfriend I haven't cut. He keeps me grounded. 
-4	negative	self-harm	ever since I was 14 I have self harmed, you could of said I was addicted but I got through it, alone. alone because nobody understood the urge & relief it gave me from all the pain and hurt I was bottling up.  it was all my fault.
-7	negative	self-harm	Ever since I was little, I've enjoyed pretending I was someone else. It started off with characters from my favourite books and movies, and then me and my sister would make up characters and act as them.  I swore it wouldn't happen again, because I really cared for Melissa, and I hurt her. But even now it hasn't changed. When I meet new people I tell them I'm from England or Scotland, and I usually follow up with a different age. I like to make up characters and act like them in public and on the internet. I feel like it's a problem and I should stop, but I can't help it. I love to be anything but what I am. 
-8	negative	self-harm	Everyday another scar is added. Countless times counting them, countless times adding to them. So desperately wanting to go back and erase the painful memory that led to this addiction. I show no one, I hide my secret that only makes the pain worse, and I fear the day that someone will find out. I wonder if anyone knows, if anyone cares, if they see it and ignore them. I wonder if one day the battle with myself will finally be over.
-5	negative	self-harm	Everyday I fear I'm going to cave in. Whenever I cave into this, I just snap and next thing I know, I've gone and cut. I'm just trying to take it day by day, but I'd rather be done with this issue for good.
-6	negative	self-harm	Everyone sees me as that quiet innocent girl in the back of the room. But in my dark side I'm that girl who cuts her upper legs so no one will see the girl who is fascinated by the thought of suicide. Who goes through the depths of her soul
-3	negative	self-harm	Every scar on my wrist was from when I needed someone  And he will always be there.
-1	negative	self-harm	everytime im depressed.. its wht i do to relieve myself from the pain bottled up inside me if i had at least a true friend maybe one day i can act the opposite..
-3	negative	self-harm	Feel like I need to vent anonymously. My parents no longer talk to me and I'm having a very difficult time accepting this.   Of course I have not listed everything in this post. It would be much longer believe it or not. 
-7	negative	self-harm	For 9 months now I have been pretending to be a 18 year old guy, to an incredible 16 year old girl online. But really, I am a 17 year old girl from the Netherlands. It started as a complete joke, I was pranking on people from a chatsite as a guy because the jokes were a bit offensive sometimes and I thought it would be weird being a girl.  Everytime I try to even think how to tell her, i start to burst out in tears. Even now I am. I am extremely desperate for a solation for the mess I have made. 
-7	negative	self-harm	for a while now have started to hate myself and who i am it all started at the end of last year(i wont go into what happened) over the summer i lost a bit of weight and this was when i also started to self harm more regularly, i am still trying to lose weight i hate my body and im discusted with myself. i havent self hamred in almost three weeks because i left my blades at my boarding schoo, ive have told 2 of my friends both want me to stop one is recovered and she is always trying to help, the other doesnt really understand, but i just feel so alone and lost rigt now ni really want to cut but if i do ill have to start covering them up, but i keep thinking to myself when it gets cold you can cut because you wont wear short sleeves in the winter, i really just needed to vent and let that out.
-1	negative	self-harm	For many years I've used self destructive behavior to cope with daily life.
-6	negative	self-harm	For me I have been struggling for years to beat the urge . I have been cutting myself for about 10 years now.i have a lot of mental health problems and cutting myself is just  how I cope with day to day life. I still do it but only a few days a week instead of every day. Originally I started to do it because I used to be bullyed but over the years my reasons have changed. x
-7	negative	self-harm	For the entire day thoughts of whether im eating too much, that im fat, that im a failure, that no one will ever love me, that no matter how hard I try I will never be beautiful, consume me. I can't go a day without stepping on the scale, and counting calories.  People tell me I've lost weight, but I just don't see it. The funny thing is, I know im sick, I know I'm not eating enough, I know I should stop but I CANT and I don't want to. I was in a relationship where I would get called fat and ugly all the time, and I believed it. It became engraved in my head that I was fat and will NEVER be "beautiful". I hate looking at myself in the mirror, knowing I wasn't "good enough". All I can ever think about is food, and getting as little of it as I can. I currently weigh 41kgs at the height of 171cm. I can't stop, I don't want to stop. I HAVE to stop.
-14	negative	self-harm	funny thing is that i've been suffering from anxiety ever since I could remember but never realized it until now.  i remember "those" feelings but never understood.  Now that I have some knowledge about anxiety disorders it makes clear sense but how did I get that way?? my panic attacks began during high school but I'm not sure what started triggering them..   I thought it was religous thinking and end of the world type of stuff but sometimes I could think of those things and nothing happens.   I still get panic attacks everynow and then but I don't let them rule over me anymore
-1	negative	self-harm	Goodbye cruel world, tonight I'm taking this life!
-9	negative	self-harm	Gracie worried about everything since the day Tina told her "No one can be trusted." Gracie beleived everything Tina said. Gracie stopped trusting her mom, dad, and her sister Anna first. Then came her teachers, workers, and everyone. Eventually, Gracie even wondered if she should trust Tina! Then came herself. Gracie's worries eventually told her to comit suicide.  Help kids like Gracie protest against kids like Tina. 
-12	negative	self-harm	Growing up my mother always had mental breakdowns. Last year she actually came into my room and said  This caused a severe issue for me. That sentence still plays In my head. In the past year I learned that I have severe depression and social Anxiety, I also learned that I am bipolar. When I tried to tell my mother she just called me a lier. She also try's to push her Baptist religion on me. She truly dost even try to understand me. And I fear that if I tell my friends about all my family issues they would end up telling others.
-2	negative	self-harm	Had a really rough day. -sigh- i regretted today from the beginning. And im sorry to the friends who love me for doing it.
-2	negative	self-harm	Hahaha, I'm so glad there is a recognized avoidant personality disorder here. I don't know why but I just avoid people when I'm walking through a hallway or anything. I just dont want it to be awkward. Cause it already is awkward. And then it becomes even more awkward because i'm avoiding them. Some people see this as an indifference to them when I actually just dont want to be awkward towards them although avoiding can be seen as offensive or awkward. I don't mean to seem cold or anything but i just can't help the avoiding thing sometimes. I try to be more comfortable and say hi or smile now and it's helped a lot but there will always be these awkward moments that bother you at how awkward you just acted.
-25	negative	self-harm	Have a question for some women out there ?  I was wrong once again . Trying to give him the benefit if the doubt. Ok , so I slowly walk to him and hand him his phone . He said did you talk to Kayla I didn't say a word trying to rethink everything so I don't bust and I did . I said whose number is blam blam His first words was do you want me to leave ?! By then I was like what have you done . Then he said you been on my FB I said no why what's on your FB well wouldn't you know he  got his phone out and deleted the messages from FB right then . So automatically I'm like why don't you want me to see what your saying ? He says still to this day , this has been over a year ago he still says it was nothing . I'm crazy he was talking about his buddy and her relation ship and about our relation ship getting advice . My thought still y would you want advice from someone who at the time wasn't in a REALATIONSHiP?
-6	negative	self-harm	have been for a year now, i have so many scars all over my legs to cope with the stress i have from my parents to do well in school and the stress of holding in my issues from people and i cut my legs and i cut my shoulders and secretly a part of me wishes i could stop but i love it to much and i'm addicted
-4	negative	self-harm	Haven't cut in weeks but really want to right now. It's just something that makes me feel like I can finally breath after being underwater for so long.  It's just like my body needs to feel the pain once more. It cannot be explained but, something is making me need the feeling. 
-1	negative	self-harm	Have you ever promised your friend you wouldn't cut anymore but you did anyway?
-3	negative	self-harm	He hung himself outside his house. Leaving his wife of 40+ years alone. I looked up to him so much, but he's just a coward to me now.
-15	negative	self-harm	Hello, Today was the last straw i guess. What I am about to say is tought! I have been lying to my parents. Maybe the reasons are that I am lazy or that i don't appreceate the, ( that one is not true) or maybe because I have to. Today my mother asked me if i smoked and i told her no but i did. My parents are REAL non smokers and i have been told " do not smoke, why do you smoke, its bad for you etc." and i know that, but forbiden fruit tastes better? I told her no because i knew that even if i said the truth it wouldn't matter, she and dad would be sad that i smoked and i didn't want her to hurt her in that way. I know that i hurt her more becausei lied but is there a differance? I'm lost, I want to stop and have a good relationship with my parents again but how can i do that after hurting them so much?!? Is it possible?  
-5	negative	self-harm	He picked her over me, but I know why because she's pretty & I'm not, she's short and cute & I'm not, she's perfectly perfect & I'm not, she's sweet & I'm not because I hate myself for you loving her
-5	negative	self-harm	He's younger than me. He was a mistake so he's only a year younger than me. He was also a drug baby and has ADHD and depression. He annoyed me throughout our childhood and since I was older I was able to subdue him most of the time. Now he's like 4 inches taller than me and 40 pounds more than me. He's become reasonably popular somehow and has a lot more friends than me. He's done way more stuff than me. His nose is much better than mine. He constantly makes fun of my nose and tells me to commit suicide. He sometimes embarrasses me in front of people. I can't do anything to stop him because he is so much bigger. I hate him and wish he was never born. My self confidence has been ruined because of him and I'll probably be friendless and single for the rest of high school at least. I'm not suicidal right now but I'm certainly frustrated and it's really rough. There's no escape from this torture.
-12	negative	self-harm	He was 17 and perfectly healthy until 2 days ago. As sudden as it was, I knew I knew with the depth of my soul that it is just a matter of days. As I did all the time, but especially that day, I kept telling him how much I loved him, what a good boy he was and how pretty he was. I took hundreds of pictures of him and begged him not to leave me. I'm haunted! I wanted him to pass peacefully at home in my arms, but as  I watched him struggling for breath I knew I needed to make the hardest decision of my life. ^..^&lt;
-17	negative	self-harm	He was my best friend. The first friend I ever had. We did some not so good things. I remember one time me and him thought it was a good idea to cook marshmallows in the microwave, and I wasn't. At all. He be the one who would be in the jail cell next to me. We even were in a band together. He did clean vocals, and did the death metal vocals. It soon ended at that. One day I got a phone call from his younger sister, Dani was found in his room dead that morning. He commuted suicide the night before, on the night of my 17th birthday. I miss him so much. R.I.P. Dani, I miss you man.
-9	negative	self-harm	He was the first man who ever made me FEEL loved. Yet anytime I said - hey that bothers me- about anything at all- he would stop talking to me. He would disappear for days,not answer the phone, not respond to texts. Once, he got mad at me for something and left me sitting alone for two days in the hotel I rented for his birthday.  So now he is gone again. For the last time. I'm still in love with him. He saved my life and made me feel I found my place in the world. I have no idea what goes on in his head- he ignores me completely. After three years together, I will probably never see or hear from him again.
-2	negative	self-harm	Hey guys and gals! P.S. if you come from this website, send me a message saying that you came from my post on the experience project .
-2	negative	self-harm	hey, my name is jessica and i just started cutting, and i need tips any one have any for me?
-11	negative	self-harm	Hey ya'll. I'm an INFP and I totally get the analysis of the our supposed "personality" (aka I was right there with everyone as the feeling of recognition and enlightenment washed over us upon reading the desc I have a therapist that I talk with regularly so I have had deep discussions with her about this but sometimes feeling like only one person really understands can be isolating. How do you guys feel? Have you felt like no one can fully live up to your expectations? If so, have you overcame it in any ways you'd like to share?
-4	negative	self-harm	Hi everyone! I would love to share a book called Living on Love the Messenger by Klaus Joehle.  Send love- I've found this to be the best medicine for my infj personality!
-22	negative	self-harm	Hi, I am new to this group. I joined because I am confused an need help. My main question is, do I have MPD. in my head I hear two voices (John and Potentia) Potentia rarely speaks, so I am usually talking to John. Potentia has been there for a long time (don't know how long exactly) John has been there since grade five. I remember little of my childhood, and have had two blackouts (that I know of), during these I was apparently conscious and able to write, walk and talk. Sometimes I have impulses (caused by Potentia) usually I can control them but occasionally he takes over. But when he does I see what happens, I just can't control what happens also I have little recollection of time (only when Potentia has been steering for a long period of time) which is usually 20 minutes to 1 hour, then I get control. I assume when John takes over I have blackouts, but this hasn't happened in ages. Sorry that was a big read, but my question for you, after reading that do you think I have MPD?? 
-2	negative	self-harm	Hi just found out I'm a infp, is that good bad or ugly? Anyone have any info??
-6	negative	self-harm	Hi, so I'm 14 years old, and tomorrow I'm going swimming with my family. I self harm and I have scars and cuts on my legs. I hate looking at my legs, and nobody in my family knows i self harm. I'm really scared that they'll find out. I just really need someone to talk to right now. My best friend left me for his girlfriend. (I'm a girl) and I've been having a hard time dealing with life. It's currently just after 2 a.m and I can't sleep. Bleh.
-5	negative	self-harm	Hi, this goes out to all those that are suffering from panic, fear and agoraphobia, I know some days can feel pretty low but hang in there, there is life after panic attacks. I suffered through occasional panic attacks that later spiraled into a crippling 4 year battle with agoraphobia and constant anxiety but through patience and determination, i got through it and so can you! 
-1	negative	self-harm	How long will it take for a deep cut on my wrist to turn white?? Or even gone..?
-3	negative	self-harm	i also cur my thighs cuz its a better place for no one to see and it hurts just as much.

-5	negative	self-harm	I am 14 and I self harm, when I am alone in my room no one can stop me no one know I'm doing none know how much pain and sadnesses a p
-6	negative	self-harm	I am a child of a borderline mother and I am so happy to have met you all.  I am now 27 years old and have just recently started researching bpd after a friend of the family profusely apologized to my brother, sister and I and suggested that I read up on BPD because she believed that my mother had the disorder (which was later confirmed by a therapist that my sister and I went to see.  He said she was NPD and BPD).  I didn't think much of it until recently.  I'll just start at the beginning 
-13	negative	self-harm	I am always wondering how people see me, what they think when they see me. I have really low self esteem and when I pass people in the street I drive myself crazy wondering what they think of me, what they see when they see me. Do they see me how I see me? Do they see me how my friends describe me? I hate the thought of being judged and I guess that makes me always wonder what people are thinking of me.
-3	negative	self-harm	I am an artist feel free to criticize me. I am an artist please don't respect me. I am an artist please don't revere me. I am an artist please God forgive me.
-3	negative	self-harm	I am an INFJ but only just. I by 11%, N 25%, F 22%, J 12%. Although I am Libran, but undecided whether astrology is actually valid.
-1	negative	self-harm	I am an introvert and I love myself that way. This mean that a big amount of people and parties drain me out, so yea I better select drinking wine with myself or my small amount of friends. Cause lets be honest there cant be any big amount of friends . I do like reading books, visiting galleries, museums and if you need more action ow yes I go swimming and ice-skating at least once a week too. That does  not make me a nerd, just because I do not want to scream, be with a bunch  of people I do not know and drink till I drop. Cause now I understand that make me happy.
-6	negative	self-harm	I AM A SELF HARMER  IM NOT SAD NOR MAD AT MYSELF FOR CUTTIN NOR AM I ASHAMED. THOSE SCARS REMIND ME EVERYDAY WHAT I HAVE BECOME WHAT I HAVE GOTTIN PASS WHAT I HAVE FOUGHT FOR WHAT I NEED TO GET OVER AND WHO I WILL NOT BECOME. SO YES I AM A SELF HARMER AND PROUD OF MY MOMENTS WHERE I WAS BONDED TO THE BLADE CAUSE I BECAME WHO I AM AND THE SCARS TO SHOW FOR IT.

-14	negative	self-harm	I am curiousdoes anyone know about INFJ shadow?  I read a little bit about it and am concerned that I might be going through it.  I have been depressed for a few months now.I don't find joy in pretty much anything. and I don't have energy.which is hard because I have so many ideas and creative things I would like to do  but I have no energy to do them.  Generally the thing I look forward to every day is just going to bedI have never felt like this beforeand I am just tired of being around people  and find myself being irritated and exhausted from interactions.  The rest of my family are all extroverts and normally this isn't really a problem but lately I just feel my energy depleted.  I do feel maybe part of the problem is I am working at a new job that is very stressful for me. I want to get better but have no idea what to doand wondering if maybe I am experiencing the INFJ shadow.  I would appreciate any help..thank you!
-5	negative	self-harm	I am my own worst critic. I'm very good at making others feel good about themselves but when it comes to me, I'm not; however I'm getting better.
-2	negative	self-harm	I am so bored all my friends are busy anyone want to chat?
-5	negative	self-harm	I am totally my own worst enemy. You would think that after making mistakes you would Learn from them.mewell I carry on regardless. In doing so I have hurt others .wish I would learn old enough
-5	negative	self-harm	I beat myself up over everything not all the time like I still remember like it was yesterday every time I've said or done something wrong. I don't know to forgive myself and it's eating me up inside.
-13	negative	self-harm	I came to high school with lots of friends but most of the time we were fighting and teachers were getting involved all the time and all the fighting we were having Kept bringing me down and one time I walked out of class because of it. That when I turned to self harm, it helped me cope with everything that's going on. I would cut myself on a regular basis with nail clipper, a pen and sometimes I use the floor at the park and made my hands bleed. But it got to a point where I would do it without realising what I done, I once use the sharper and made a big cut on my arm and It wouldn't stop bleeding for 20 minutes straight and that when I realise I need to stop and now I do it every now and then but as bad as before. At the moment I can cope it but sometime I kind of go into a panic attack kind of thing where I would need to cut , but now I joined a football team and it does by putting all the feelings and anger into kicking that football as hard as I can. 
-8	negative	self-harm	I can feel it Welling up, slowly consuming my soul a little every day. The Darkness, the anger, the pain the depression. It's eating at me slowly corrupting my core. I want to hurt so many people, I want to escape from this life. There are so many things my dark side wants. I feel as though I can't control myself much more, my hands are shaking from anger towards this world and all that live on it, but I do not understand why I think I need help helpme
-5	negative	self-harm	I cannot believe it has been two years since I last cut myself.  I still trace the scars at night and I still remember the way the blade felt on my skin.  I look at those scars and I can still see the fresh blood from years ago.  And I'm still haunted by it.  I'm too numb to feel the pain those memories should bring me but the ghost of the pain I felt before is more present now than it has ever been.  I'm angry because I can't feel the pain and I feel guilty for even wanting to.
-2	negative	self-harm	I can't eat..it feels like this weight that's put on my body that pulls me down deeper and deeper into this black hole. It's okay that my stomach hurts..as long as it not from being full of food. 
-1	negative	self-harm	I can't really stop. I'm not thin. But I look better than I did 5 months ago. Eating makes me hate myself, but not eating makes me feel slightly better. People keep telling me if I don't eat I'll just gain the weigh back fast, but I've been on and off starving myself and maintained my weight.
-3	negative	self-harm	I can't stop . I have tried and I have had so many blades taken away from me, self harm controls me . It helps me stop thinking   Too much..
-12	negative	self-harm	I carved my flesh since the first year of high school. when I started I did every day, but only scratches kinda. it eventually got to where the deeper I did it the less often I'd have to. so I started to cut every week instead, then I could go a month sometimes but they wounds got larger and larger. finally in my last year of high school I stopped having found a way to cope and other things. but recently things are falling apart. not for the things like when I was in schoolbut maybe worse.    I know this isn't healthy but I just don't think it's wrong enough to stop doing. it's my body in the first place..
-2	negative	self-harm	I couldn't pretend that I was happy. I broke down in front of two classmates tonight, he was one of them. I wish I had controlled the situation better, I think it was a mistake letting them know about my addiction to self harm and my feelings. 
-4	negative	self-harm	I cut again. So deep this time. The deepest. I've never done it like this before. No one understands. I can't deal with t anymore. Long sleeves for the rest of my life. Kill me.
-4	negative	self-harm	I cut all the way up my forearm. Red puffy bumps with blood that dots up in a little line. That's how I spend most of my nights now 
-14	negative	self-harm	I cut from when I was 12 to 16. I had up to a hundred cuts some days on my arm now it has been three years and it's weird I remember how I started like it was yesterday but when it came to quitting I never said this is the day I always said this is the day I'll try to stop I don't know the exact date I stopped but to me that does not matter. I wear my scars proudly now because they are a part of what made me, me. I will never be ashamed
-1	negative	self-harm	I cut  I can't stop I need help
-8	negative	self-harm	I cut into my skin because I'm angry, I'm sad, I'm hurting, I'm trying to hide it, I'm lost, I'm broken. I cut into my skin because I want to see the scars I feel on the inside, I want to have proof that I'm alive. I cut into my skin because it's all that is left, I'm done looking for a better way. I don't talk about "it" because I don't trust anymore. I cut into our skin because it's all I know
-3	negative	self-harm	I cut myself and wouldn't have stopped if I hadn't of forced myself to wake up my mom so she could take the knife from me
-1	negative	self-harm	I cut myself because my emotions are too intense. I hate it. Sometimes I feel like cutting is not enough and I that I'd just rather commit suiiiicidee.  
-3	negative	self-harm	I cut myself for the first time a week back and it really made me happy, and now when I feel it, it makes me smile 
-3	negative	self-harm	I cut my self. I love the way the blade feels when it slices my skin. I can't wear a bathing suit anymore so I don't cut my legs anymore. I cut where no one can see it. I used to want to quit but now I can't quit. If I quit I will end up dead.
-7	negative	self-harm	I cut on my lower legs cause if I slit my wrist everyone will see. There are a lot of scars that aren't healing. Every time it look down I remember why I have them. The story they tell aren't pleasant. I don't like to do it, I don't like the memories but once you start it's hard to stop.
-2	negative	self-harm	I cut on the top of my thigh, I can hide it easily that way. And last night I was angry, so I cut too deep. It didn't stop bleeding for hours and now today it hurts a lot and seems to be gaping open. It still bleeds too if I walk. Thinking I might need to go to the hospital but I can't risk someone finding out :/ any advice?
-3	negative	self-harm	I cut will my arms filled with the only emotion telling me I was still alive. I hid it behind false smiles. I let everything build up till one day I lost it at work. For the first time I exposed my self and didn't regret it.  I don't cut anymore but sometimes still want to. The thought of doing it again and them getting mad isn't worth it though.
-9	negative	self-harm	I did mainly last year, when I was going through a very hard time. I still get urges from time to time, but haven't in months. I almost went too deep right before school started in August, and now I have nasty scars on my wrists & thighs. I promise it gets better, & I'm here for anyone who needs help with self harm &lt;3 stay strong lovelies.
-4	negative	self-harm	Idk i luv it and at the same time hate itthe feeling is great,but the scars are horrible.but even tho itz wrong,i cant and i WONT stop.i should have never started,cuz once i did the feelings were bittersweet.almost so addictive i think about it more than anything.so its not just that its really hard to stop,but its also my only friend.and sadly,itz the only one tht doesnt leave like the othersitz so complicated ;(
-6	negative	self-harm	I'd like to say that I stopped for a long time and just recently started to feel the anger/insecurity that would always flood my thoughts. I don't think that those thoughts ever stopped, but I could control my feelings if I drowned myself in other things. So yes, I stopped cutting for 3 years, and now have started again. I have found myself not being able to express my anger, so I have reverted back to my outlet. I feel stupid and as if everyone will judge me or be disappointed in me. I've never been a talker nor had many friends(trust issues). But its scary that the question I am asking myself is where do I do it that no one will notice????
-5	negative	self-harm	I don't intend to kill myselfat least I don't think I do..I have a temper and I can snap easilyFor some reason when the cold blade slices my skin a sense of relief spreads through me and calms me downThe pain kick in but I hardly care. The scars from the past cuts still leave imprints on my skin. No one seems to notice them so I keep doing it. Blood seeps out and I just stare at it as it flows down. The pain and anger I have in my heart is real and could one day make it so I will cut deeper each time. There is nothing I can do. I've tried everything to calm down but nothing works..If I let myself rage..I might actually kill someone. The very thought of it scares meso I continue to cut. deeper and deeper. 
-7	negative	self-harm	I don't know what this is.. Or who reads this, but hello! Within the past two weeks, I've started cutting. I haven't cut in four years, but now it's coming back. And the ability to be able to show what I'm feeling on the inside, on the outside, is amazing to me.. I was also diagnosed with severe depression/ and mild anxiety.. People judge so much.. Yet they have no idea what's going on in my life.. Just makes things so much worse.. Thanks for listening !
-3	negative	self-harm	I dont know wud to do and how to stop myself from doing self-harm.. Im battling it and sometimes i just cant stop myself..i need help
-15	negative	self-harm	I dont really recall when it all started. I remember making that first cry of red tears at the age of 13 (start of year seven). I remember how I was feeling as it happened. My friend was going through a hard time and I couldnt cope, with how she was coping with it herself. From then onwards, it became my way of release. Something I could control. I was usually a person who didnt give two cares of what someone said about me, but as I soon realized, very quickly, that this itself in a whole, was false. I guess I just bottled it all up and I had to let it out.
-1	negative	self-harm	I failed again, To talk to anyone.
-2	negative	self-harm	I feel different each and everyday. Like mentally different, like a different person takes over. Some times I'll be really happy and bubbly, other days I'm depressed, but don't want to be alone. I feel like I should name them sometimes. Depression, remorse, loneliness, anger, excitement, boredom..they all need names. Maybe it's multiple personalities, but then again, maybe not. Who knows?
-3	negative	self-harm	I feel like i have a lot side . These are my side.                                                                   1.  i used to be inoncent,naive lonely girl.                                 2. I used to act agresive and i get mad easily.                                                                3.i used to be so cold and say mean things.           What do you think?
-9	negative	self-harm	I feel like i need to say some of the things that are going through me head.  The last thing that's on my mind, is suicide. I think about this more then I really should.  Thinking 'Hmm. Maybe no one would miss me, and even if they did they would get over it.' Those thoughts happen a lot. More then they should. And when I talk about it, like I am now. They're stronger. But anyway. Nothing really stops me once I think of it like I do. I mean it's not like I'm going to do anything, I'm not strong enough to. I just think about it so much that I sit there for hours at a time and just cry my eyes out. I wanna stop these thoughts but nothing is going to to begin with. No one really understands I guess. Sometimes it scares that crap out of me. I don't get it.
-3	negative	self-harm	I feel like today was just this major fake. My father seemed troubled, so I tried my best to make him smile. Now I'm back home and the helicopters overhead shake my roof. The night sounds are back. I don't know why I have this urge.  I cannot cry, but if I didI wish it actually did something.
-9	negative	self-harm	I feel myself withdrawing from life. I live a lie every day. Acting how I see as normal, saying I love you, when I'm not sure if I even know what that means. My feelings becoming more and more distant. My heart becoming harder. I've seen a psychiatrist and a psychologist for 10 years. I've been diagnosed with PTSD, OCD, SOCIAL ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION, PANIC ATTACKS. My docs say it is all caused by abuse, not by any internal mental illness of my own organic chemistry. But my mind and my feelings are becoming more distant and more difficult to reach. I feel like I am slowly disappearing, one day at a time, until I become stone. Right now that's not even scarey.
-7	negative	self-harm	I feel really bad. I thought it was getting better but it's not. I feel bad and I want to apologize to everyone I've ever encountered for being who I am. I feel bad and I just wanted to write this here, because no one else will listen. I went to my psych recently and he didn't help, I don't know. I did it again today and I've been crying a lot. If someone wants to talk, I'm down.
-6	negative	self-harm	I feel so lost all the time. There are two sides of who I am. The side where I can possible try to forget everything and live my life and laugh have fun, without people knowing how I really am, and my real feelings.    I find it so hard to sleep at night unless I'm exhausted through out the day. The amount of thoughts that just run through my mind just come back as I'm on the quiet and alone. It's that time I feel like I was someone to comfort me and tell me "everything going to be alright".
-1	negative	self-harm	I feel the same way, ya know sometimes I think to myself that I was born in a wrong family and get treated as some shyt 
-4	negative	self-harm	If i go into the bank or anywhere that has fliers or stacks of papers  and they are askew i take the time to straighten them all. I do it almost automatically when i see them and i do it enough times that my family and friends make little joking comments about having neat stacks of papers. but that is really the extent of my tendencies.I am in no ways a neat person i hate cleaning.  My stacks of papers at home can be any which way and it does not bother me only in public will i do it.
-1	negative	self-harm	I finally told someone that i cut and burn my arms and that i still do it. Im shaking I'm so scared.
-18	negative	self-harm	I first started self harming when I was 13. At first it wasnt overly serious and never made much of an impact to my body. But gradually over time it began to get more serious. Instead of just scratching my skin, I began cutting with sharpener blades. Im not even certain why I did it. All i know is that I felt like I had no worth, all my friends had turned against me and I just hated myself so, so much. Then, 14 weeks ago today, I went too far. Through various occurences, eventually my parents found out and Im now here saying I havent cut in over 3 months. And although things are going well for me, I still have the enevitable scars and there isnt a single day that goes by where I dont consider it again. Thats my story, wbu?  Megan-Louise xx
-4	negative	self-harm	If you didn't know I have a cousin that I'm close with and her name is Dianna. We tell each other our secrets, visit each other, and do whatever best friends do.  On her facebook I would always see that she posts pictures of her either at a party or in the club with her friends. I kind of feel like she thinks she's too good for me or something.
-4	negative	self-harm	If you're reading this you'll know. This site helps Who knew.
-4	negative	self-harm	I gave my life to God this past summer and haven't self harmed until today. It's crazy how just one cut can make you crave more. Tonight is going to be a long night.
-1	negative	self-harm	I get from cutting myself. 
-6	negative	self-harm	I get very depressed and i used to cut myself alot i am alot better now i still have problems, i mostly want to help people who are going through problems anyone can message me and i will talk to you and listen
-1	negative	self-harm	I go through enough of this stuff to understand that everyone needs someone to talk to you. Feel free to message me if you need someone to talk to.
-8	negative	self-harm	I got triggered at school today, a girl In my class who I was talking to at lunch had a razor blade. She pulled it out her bag when she was cleaning it out. I asked her why she had one in her bag and she said she walks home alone and couldn't bring pepper spray so she brought a razor. It was kinda weird. But since then all I've had on my mind was the razor blade. I haven't cut in a while but now I can't get it out my head.
-3	negative	self-harm	I got very depressed when I was in my teens and started to cut my hands and wrists with a knife I had.  Things got so bad one day I very nearly slit my wrists all the way.  But I broke the habit and haven't done anything like that for decades now. See it can happen 
-5	negative	self-harm	I had my first cut 2 monthes ago, but I knew I would cut again. And so from 3 days ago and on I've cut everyday. And I feel as if this is going to go on for a while.
-12	negative	self-harm	I had really bad anxiety when i woke up this morning i was sick. I then got to school thinking that everythings fine and its all going to be okay. I got into maths and my teacher sent me straight back out for refusing to sit next to some girl. I go back into class and i sit away from her. I was laughing and smiling everything was okay, i stood up i lost feeling in my legs and my eye sight then went blurry, i started    struggling to breathe. Figured out i was having a panic attack and got sent straight to first aid and behaviour. After i calmed down this attack has left me feeling very sick and seriously anxious. I dont know whats going on.
-12	negative	self-harm	I had the greatest brother ever. along time ago we were leaving a friends house and a 18 wheeler almost hit us so he misses the driver and we go off a clift were there was water I got out but he didn't my set belt broke somehow and that's how I lived iv went through 4 face surges a broke arm and 3 broke ribs I miss .tj so bad 
-6	negative	self-harm	I hated my adopted family. My 'mother' was always fighting with us. She tried to beat me when I was 16. The first time was for something stupid and she caught me by surprise. The second time I was able to stop her. I ended up moving out and never willingly talked to them again. I did have to straighten a few things out but once that was done i never talked to them again.
-3	negative	self-harm	I HATE IT I HATE EVERYTHING my friends are always making me feel left out I'm always pushed out the group and I'm not invited to things..that's what makes me feel so horrible. I have this disgusting fear of everyone hating me which I think they do so it's not really a fear it's real life..but I just want someone close to me that I can talk to and not feel like I'm boring them and have them reply like they actually care..but tonight was bad I cut..deep
-2	negative	self-harm	I hate my body. I want to be skinny and beautiful. I want a thigh gap, hipbones, ribs, and bony collar bones. I feel that if I am thin, someone may love me. So I starve myself. I am about to start a three day fast. I want to get that amazing empty and faint feeling. I am going to deprive myself until I am 85 pounds. I can't wait until I get so skinny that people whisper about how thin I've gotten behind my back.
-3	negative	self-harm	I hate my dad. But I still love him so much. Sometimes I wonder why I can't break all the ties I've had with him. And sometimes I DO try to break those ties but I find that I can't. Why?!
-6	negative	self-harm	I hate my mind On good days I help people when I can how I can. Sounds typical I know but that's they way I am and I've accepted it, but when the dark of night rolls around I hear things, voices sometimes, sounds other. They don't tell me to do anything in fact they seem to be out to hurt me I can't silence it except when my mind is busy I don't sleep anymore from fear I feel my mind falling apart and I'm falling in a pit Dramatic sounding I know But I can't help but feel the way I do and I've told people who can start helping me find help and they tell me that I'm just full of myself and just trying to attract attention I feel lost in my own head I hate myself for it
-2	negative	self-harm	I hate myself. I hate me for what I have become. I promised myself I would never let it become this bad but I need help. Someone PLEASE help me! I'm so scared to be left on my own. I'm scared of what I might do. I shouldn't be feeling like this. But no one cares about me so what is the point of sticking around. I already feel numb why not end it altogether?  
-2	negative	self-harm	I hate myself soooo much.  And my stupid body thinks it good enough but I know in the back of my mind it's really not.
-5	negative	self-harm	I hate the way I look because I've never liked my complexion. I hate always feeling like no one will ever want me because they prefer my friends. I feel like I can't even look in the mirror sometimes because I'm disappointed in myself. I wish I could be wanted and cared for by someone who doesn't care about how I THINK I should look, but more so about how I am and how I was created to look. I just want to be enough for somebody who wants to bring me up when I'm at my lowest.
-7	negative	self-harm	I hate to admit this, but at times I still struggle with this.  I have not done this in a long time and I feel a lot of guilt about it.  I hide it from everyone, so no one knows. I know I'm admitting to this on a "public" forum I guess because I get pre-occupied about thoughts of doing it again, and honestly talking to strangers is at times easier than talking to my loved ones about this. I just feel so uncomfortable in the skin I'm in.  It's strange because I'm very outgoing.  I'm blessed with friends and familyi do struggle from depression and am currently under medical care for and I have had years of therapy.  I think I just get overwhelmed by the emotional pain I have experienced in my life that doing this "act" takes the focus of the emotional pain and forces me to concentrate on the physical pain inflicted. I know this is very dark and I am old enough to know better.   Please feel free to share your comments from your own experience, strength and hope. Thank you.
-1	negative	self-harm	I hate when people look at my scars and judge me. I have a dark past that's no secret. But what makes you think it's okay to point and stared. I'm not a freak. Just different.
-10	negative	self-harm	I have 3 major phobias that rule way to much of my life and I want them gone! I've tried letting go of them but it's like they are glued to my palms and no matter how hard I try the fears are still eating away at me.            I would love to conquer all of these. please can someone help? 
-6	negative	self-harm	I have a boy friend  I've only been with him for a little while. But I fell head over heels in love with him. And I always somehow manage to hurt him..I don't mean to. I love him i do. But I have trust issues and intimacy issues. And every guy in my life that has ever told me they love me had left me.  Or hurt me. Or hit me, i love him i really do. But I don't deserve him..
-6	negative	self-harm	I have a fear of gas stoves. Once when I was 15, my grandmother was telling me to be careful when starting her gas stove so it wouldn't explode, and after that, I refuse to go near a gas stove. It's embarrassing because cooking usually requires a stove, and mine is gas, not electric. My own brother can use it without fear, to make bacon, and he's 11. I feel like I will never be able to cook as well as him. I also have a fear of talking to people on the phone or on video chat. It just feels awkward. The only people I talk to on the phone without a problem are my own family.  
-5	negative	self-harm	I have a scar that runs down my arm. cuz I played with a razor and it did me harm. I played with it in a twist, the razor gave my vein a kiss & I ripped the skin into my wrist.
-7	negative	self-harm	I have attempted it all. I've taken diet pills, strict diets, trainers, and starving myself. I have only ever gotten one to ever work for me. With the pills, diets, and trainers I've only gotten so far with it before the weight would just stop. No matter what I would try after that I would just start gaining, despite the amount of working out would do for me. So I started to starve myself when I was working two jobs and it worked great. I didn't even notice it happening and next thing you know I'm down to 140 pounds. I felt like I was myself for once. I need a starving buddy! I can't do it by myself. 
-12	negative	self-harm	I have been clean from self harm for about 2 years now, and I have had my wonderful boyfriend Logan for a year. Well last night, we got into a huge argument, because I had no idea where he was. Well I got angry, and I called him some names and ended up breaking it off. We got back together, and I was okay. But then I got this feeling inside I haven't felt in 2 years. I went to bathroom, took a razor and cut my thigh. I felt so awful and I took pills and I just lost it. I felt awful. How could I do this? I don't know what's wrong with me. I just want help.
-12	negative	self-harm	I have been dealing with self harm since 7th grade. I'm now in 10th grade and its only gotten worse. I feel so awful after I do it. It started when I dated this guy, who also bullied me behind my back. I was bullied a lot. When I used to get on the bus, the kids would make whale noises at me and call me a fat cow. That's when the depression started. It started with a scratch  and as the years go once I can't even wear shorts. My legs are full of scars. My arm has scars all over it. Burn marks too. I just want to know if there is anyone out there that I can relate to?
-3	negative	self-harm	I have been gaining weight out of control!! I have been dieting and exercising and that is not helping!  Sooo now I need a starving buddy :D someone who will support me! I need to loose 40lbs  message me if you want to help me!
-3	negative	self-harm	I have been incredibly socially anxious for my entire life. On top of that, I am also every socially awkward. Even when talking to people that I already know, and have already met before, I have a hard time being able bring myself to not be awkward around them.
-4	negative	self-harm	I have been on contraceptive implant for over 5 years and i have put a lot of weight on. I hate myself and dont know how i let myself get to this stage. I want to loose weight fast as i cant look at myself. I know the best way to do it is to starve myself. Please give me tips of how to overcome the desire to eat?
-14	negative	self-harm	I have been self-harming for years. It came with the depression, anxiety, OCD and anorexia Nervosa. It's such a hard battle and journey. From cutting too deep on accident, hiding scars, being harassed for cuts accidentally exposed. It's definitely challenging to live with such an addiction. I started self harming when I was eleven and I like to think of myself as a pretty avid cutter. I used to let it define who I was, but hopefully that will no longer be the circumstance when I get older. It gets better I'm sure. I have thousands of scars and they are a part of me just as much as my eye colour and skin tone.
-7	negative	self-harm	I have been self injuring since I was 12. I wrote this poem while I was in HS. When things get really stressful and hard to handle I do get the urge and sometimes I do cut/hit myself. I have grown a lot over the years though. I hope that one day I will be completely self injury free. I will always have the scars, and the scars tell a deep story. and the crimson showers of temptation repeat over  again.
-15	negative	self-harm	I have been very depressed since coming to college, but I'm not the type of person who harms myself.  I'm a pretty crazy person, but since being at school in Milwaukee that has only increased.  My friends and I party every weekend and this Friday didn't go as it usually does.  My friend and I got in a fight and I would of normally been upset about it, but being drunk I got even more upset about that and just about everything else going wrong. I left the party myself, went back to my dorm and just found myself even more upset. After crying for a while I turned on my curling wand and put four burns on my arm at the highest setting. I DO NOT KNOW WHY. I saw it in the morning and couldn't believe it like what was I thinking. It's now blistering and hurts so insanely bad. Probably going to scar and it's in such an obvious area. I'm just like embarrassed now. everyone has been asking what happened and I don't even know what to say this totally isn't me.
-3	negative	self-harm	I have BPD With my over sensitive emotions I tend to cut as a release from me the pain And the sensation of calamity feels so good that it becomes an addiction The calamity being in direct contrast with my crazy thought process and mood swings It just feels so good
-2	negative	self-harm	I have cried so much that my tears have stopped flowing  I don't know how more I can take any more
-3	negative	self-harm	I have cut now for the last six year's. I know it's dangeres but I makes me feel worth something i've always wanted to tell my story but no one i no wants to listen it's hard very hard 
-7	negative	self-harm	I have eight scares and the only reason I have stopped is because it was the last promise I made to my ex before we were torn apart The pain is all still there though. just no longer in the skin. Sometimes the mental pain is worst, no one sees it, no one knows. other than me every memorie hurts every thought pushes me closer to going  over the edge. You know sometimes I kinda wanna fall 
-7	negative	self-harm	I have friends who self harm by cutting but I'm the only one who burns themselves.. Is there anyone else that does this? I just want to know I'm not alone. I like to heat up sewing needles or bobby pins over a candle then press them into the back of my hand.. It gives me these raised white marks / scars..
-8	negative	self-harm	I have had a lot of bad things happen to me in my life, and I think that those plus many other things caused me to start using self harm as a coping mechanism.  Over the years, I have come to the realization that I don't cut to feel pain. When I cut, I cut very quickly and deeply, to minimize the pain, but to maximize the scar. This is what I cut for, the scar. I guess that I think having many scars gives me a type of validity to the outside world of how bad I'm feeling.
-1	negative	self-harm	I have high self esteem and and proud if who I am! But I can't help but being self conscious sometimes. Every teen is!
-6	negative	self-harm	I have lost a very close friend, someone online, don't say anything ok. But she was such a good friend I love her so much, she stabbed herself in the lung and died in hospital. I believe although she's biologically dead a soul as beautiful as hers isn't going anywhere just yet.  Love you ellie R.I.P
-3	negative	self-harm	I have more than 100 ways to hate myself. The top 10 are: Is my mom a tiger mom? Yes, and it hurts. 
-2	negative	self-harm	I have never admitted this out loud, to anyone. I have a hard time even truly admitting it to myself, but it has destroyed my life, and I need to change.
-3	negative	self-harm	I haven't cut. But for months I've wanted to. I just broke apart a razor and hid the blades. I hid them in a hiding place I made weeks ago.  
-18	negative	self-harm	I haven't cut in awhile. I didn't even miss it anymore. Hardly ever thought about it & lost all the urges. Until my mom & I started arguing again like we used to. It brought up so many past painful memories. I had been fine up until that point. The first argument I just forced myself to sleep, the second one is what tore me down. The things she said, I know she didn't mean them but they got to me. They reminded me of what our home used to be like & I realized I still haven't forgiven myself for what I put my family through. So I left for work early & bought fresh new blades. Had to ask the store clerk to open the glass door because I was buying them for my grandpa. And I cut, for the first time in I don't know how long. I did it. This will be one of my biggest struggles.
-2	negative	self-harm	I haven't cut myself for one whole week but just a few minutes ago I did and I don't feel bad about it! My brother just ditched me at school and I had to wait two hours for my parents to come pick me up, I got four texts each from a different friend not at the same time though, and found out that they are all moving, so now I'll only have one friend at school, and while I was waiting to be picked up I found out that my parents were on their way and decided to stop and eat at a fast food place and they never got anything for me, I ripped my favorite jacket on the car door and now it's trash, I found out my fish died, and I just found out I'm failing one of my classes. I think that I've had a pretty rough day 
-2	negative	self-harm	I haven't cut myself since moving here. I'd been holding off on doing it. But things got worse and I said "ah fvck it all" and I went and put a razor in my skin. I cannot even have a little bit of relief. For me there is nothing. 
-5	negative	self-harm	I haven't cut regularly in years, but lately life is really tough and depression is all encompassing. it's gotten really hard not to relapse. every day is a battle against the impulses i don't want to give in to. i just want a friend i can talk to who would encourage me when i'm trying not to give in. i would be a good friend back. anybody?
-6	negative	self-harm	I haven't done meth for about 4 years now.I'm so much better off but live is still hard. The thing I miss the most are friends. I'm 43 now and the people that I used to know, that I grew up with, I can't hang out with them. I also don't fit in with people I grew up with that didn't become meth addicts. I just feel so alone sometimes. I just used to have so many people that I hung out with, that came by, that called. Now, nothing.  It's hard to make friends at this age!
-8	negative	self-harm	I haven't layed a knife to my wrists in 3 years. I used to cut every other day because nasty rumors were being spread about me and I didn't like anyone. Now I have very thin, white scars on both my left and rigbht arm, though more are on my right arm. You can barely even see them now.  I'm glad that I still don't feel horrible and that I'm not cutting anymore, but I still get questions and odd looks when people see my scars and that always leads into an awkward conversation.
-1	negative	self-harm	I haven't self harmed in over two months. Things are getting too hard. I give up. Two months goes down the drain tonight.
-7	negative	self-harm	i have recently confessed to my family about my self harm and my feelings, i am seeing a counsellor and i was asked not to self harm again but i have, on my ankle it is obviously self harm and I'm going to a party the Monday after Christmas, i was wondering if anyone knew of a way to make it fade or the scabs go quicker?  Thank you so much!
-13	negative	self-harm	I have scars from operations, working in crappy environments to make just enough money to have a place to live, and I have scars from childhood accidents like when someone left a knife on top of the fridge which fell and cut my eyebrow when I was three. My scars are inside and out. And now I'm writing a book about scars: American Scar Stories. I want to tell scar stories on my site. I'd love to hear your story. If you'd like to share, check out www.jennycutlerlopez.com to get in touch. 
-8	negative	self-harm	i have scars not only on my wrists, but all the way up my arms, stomach, legs, and thighs. all these scars that remind me of all the pain i feel. all these scars remind me of  memories i so badly want to forget, just making me want to add new cuts. nobody understand that cutting becomes an addiction, nobody understands the amount of pain we're in to feel like cutting is the only way we can get through the day. 
-13	negative	self-harm	I have self harmed for over a year now everyday I feel worse about myself. It was so bad last year that I was having panic attacks and self harming during class. I used to use erasers and push pins but I've recently switched to blades and cut almost everyday on my stomach. It all started last year because of the bullying. They told me to die everyday and told me I was ugly and stupid. That went on for almost 3 months when we finally switched seats in class. Even though that ended my anxiety was getting worse and I started to be become paranoid. I was unable to sleep at night because of it and I constantly feared I was being follow. Finally summer came and I was away from them. I was able to live a happy life for a few months until school started back up again. This year I've been lied to and backstabbed so many times.
-2	negative	self-harm	I have self harmed for seven years. Not knowing my father, my mother leaving me, and I'm dead to the world. I do anything to kill the pain, cutting, punching hard surfaces, drinking, smoking, anything to kill the pain. I want to stop but I can't.
-3	negative	self-harm	I have so many scars all up my arms, I feel ashamed to look at them I I'm honest, there always there. I try and make ten disappear by making more and more cuts then realize what I have just done, I'm actually addicted to the pain. My thighs are even worse. I'm constantly hiding clothes.
-8	negative	self-harm	I have stopped cutting. My bestfriend drinks, & I dont like that. I cut, & he doesnt like that. So we made a promise to eachother that he'll stop drinking & ill stop cutting, for good.  I have a stuffed catterpiller on my bed, & I never told ANYBODY this, not even him, but theres a hole in it that you cant really see, & thats where i keep my knife. Im about to take it out. I think hes really helped me. Thank you, Simon. I love you 
-11	negative	self-harm	I have the most beautiful man in the entire world. I'm truly a lucky girl to have him. Why do I say this? Two and a half years together, he has been by my side through everything. I began self harm about a year ago, and it didn't get bad until about six months ago. Yet he didn't leave me, or say I was a lost cause. He was there for me, and now being two months clean I have him to thank for giving me the support and love I needed to make it through this, I couldn't have done it without him. I realized today that I may have scars, but I'm still beautiful. Yes I went through a hard time, became weak, though now I'm strong again. This man told me that my scars don't represent who I am. And he's right. They don't. It took me a long time to believe that but now I do. Thank you handsome for being here for me every step of the way, and still loving me even when I didn't love myself.  Your my hero.
-6	negative	self-harm	I have this fantasy often. How would people react? I'm sure people would be sad, but they'd get over it. They'd move on. They'd forget about me. My life is awful. I can't take it anymore. I'm done. The only thing preventing me from doing it is my parents. The pain I would cause them. I don't want to live anymore. I am so tired of the depression. Of the guilt. Of the constant struggle. I want it to end. Please help me. Please.
-4	negative	self-harm	I have to do this I've tried diets I'm sick of it ! I just want to thin enough to look like how I used to be.
-7	negative	self-harm	I have "ugly" bruises dancing up my arms and seating themselves on my thighs. To me, they're so beautiful And that's my story. My scars and cuts are my art. I look at my body in disgust but when I find my way to the blade marks I find a sense of comfort. The only way I can escape reality, anxiety, myself, others. It's so intriguing to look at each slice and reliving the moment I ran away from. Delicately running my finger tips past the risen skin. Remembering and feeling the relief I'm not an idiot, I know it's temporary. But my cope, and masterpiece are my cuts.. And though I may be judged, I am content with my "sickness".
-4	negative	self-harm	I hope you guys won't hate me like the last time I've posted. I don't remember the last time I cut, but I remember what it feels like. I remember the pleasure I used to get from it. I remember every single mark healing on my body.  The most beautiful and inspiring people have scars. Don't ever forget that
-8	negative	self-harm	I indeed have cuts and scars , but they make me the person I am today , I do look at them and hate them with a passion but without them I wouldn't of learnt from my mistakes and I certainly wouldn't understand the pain that certain individuals feel in the modern day. 2 years ago one of my dearest friends tried to kill herself, I instinctively took the role of the caring friend that will look after her at her darkest moments, I learnt that people need to be shown love to the highest of extents to realise that someone is actually there for them. Soon after she was sectioned and started her recovery I was sent into a constant whirl wind of twisted depression for 1 and a half years only recently recovered , I do hate the thought of what has happened within the past few years but I am grateful to it aswel that I now can see behind those fake smiles that people put on to hide the pain , because now instead of being oblivious to it I can give them my hand and help them.
-1	negative	self-harm	I just cut myself. And I feel like I'm high. All the pain is centered into my wrist.. The cuts.. The pain.. It feels so good.. Sweet relief
-2	negative	self-harm	I just found out that my friend in England just committed suicide last night. I feel like a pice of my soul dies with him.
-2	negative	self-harm	I just got out of the mental hospital for overdosing and my mom saw all the cuts on my arms and legs so she hid all the razors and knives basically anything I can cut with so now that I can't cut I started burning myself with a curling iron I just hold till I can't take it anymore I really just wish I would die but I guess I deserve to suffer 
-3	negative	self-harm	i just hate myself because it gives me strength. Love comes with care and tender which makes you weak. And in this world you can't survive if you are weak.On the other hand hate brings pain deep down the core of heart and your heart finally becomes stone and you feel nothing and hate becomes your friend and that's why i feed myself on hate. that is why i hate myself and don't keep telling stories why you hate yourself and live with it feel the agony and be different.
-2	negative	self-harm	I just started realizing that I have a dark side. I was talking to a friend who is into the same stuff as me you know like supernatural creatures blood cemeteries  the list goes on and that's when I realized that I'm into dark things I was so concerned and intrigued that I asked my history teacher since he studies supernatural stuff and its getting worse It kind if heightens my ability to not sleep and it messes with my eating habits it's constantly on my mind I even fricking research on it it's they bad
-4	negative	self-harm	I just started trying to starve myselfany tips on how not to eat? I find myself in my fridge way to often. Whenever I do eat I try to throw it back up. Sometimes it works sometimes not. Any tips on when the best times to throw it up are? I'm still new at this. Still trying to find excuses for why I'm not at the dinner table most nightsjust any thing for a new comer? It would really help.
-1	negative	self-harm	I just want one person here next to me and I haven't spoken to him in a week , and I can not see him for 6 months and I feel so lonely and not myself advise on how to cope with loneliness ? Xox
-4	negative	self-harm	I just went through a bad break up and the first thing i thought was "maybe cutting again will stop the pain" but i was afraid that If i started i wouldnt stop again.. My freshman year of high school I would cut myself on a regular basis. A year after that I stopped. So after this break up a few days ago I wanted to feel pain to make me feel better. I didnt want to cut so i figured out a different to get the pain of hurting myself without something that would kill me. For Christmas my dad got me a guitar. I kept playing it over and over again until my fingers hurt and started to get calluses. It made me feel better, got the feelings of hurting myself, and now im better at the guitar! 
-3	negative	self-harm	I knew a girl who liked to draw, STAY STRONG xx
-7	negative	self-harm	I know a liar who likes to Smear and Shame Victims.  Even if that meant she would use Violence. At the time she was probably the worst person I thought I had met..   
-9	negative	self-harm	I know alot of people say self harm is attention seeking but it really isn't. I've never told anyone (other than my boyfriend) of my self harming, I never did it for attention, I did it purely for release. 
-4	negative	self-harm	I learned to understand why I was cutting and I learned to recognise when I was likely to do it. I gave myself backup plans of other things to do and I told people about it. Give yourself a way out. You can do this.
-28	negative	self-harm	I Lied When I Said I Stopped Cutting. I Never Stopped I Just Got Better At Hiding It On My Body. I Lied When I Said I Was Better. I Still Have The Same Feelings. i Just Didn't Want To Take My Anti-Depresents. i Didn't Want To Talk To A Therapist Nor A Psychartrist. I Wanted To Make My Self Better. As You Can See I Failed. I Realize That I Can't Do It Myself. I Realize That i'm Not Okay. I Just Don't Want To Hear My Parents Saying All This Is For Attention. I Hope Their Happy because I Never Got Better I Just Got Worse. I Now Know That I Will Have To Hide It Untill Someone Figures it Out But It'll Probably Be To Late. Im The Daughter That Lies To Protect Her Family From Getting Hurt. I'm That Sister That  Pretends To Be Happy. I'm That Friend That Wont Bother You With Her Problems. I'm The Student That Doesn't Seem Quite Right. One Day You'll Know The Truth.       -Alexis
-3	negative	self-harm	I live n a 3 story house, City of Angels, my house is over 100 yrs. old, if the walls could talk!!!
-5	negative	self-harm	I'll make this short and sweet. I stopped, and I restarted and its getting worse and worse. my family knows, but even that can't stop me. I went from scratching to cutting and I'm scared. I don't like this.
-15	negative	self-harm	I lost a friend to suicide. We were on the same soccer team when we were 5. We didn't stay in touch and I didn't hear her name again until I heard her father died. My mom researched it more because she recognized his face and she found out that my friend had committed suicide 6 months before. I wish I had stayed in touch. I wish I could have done something to help her. I miss her. I cried all day when I found out. I don't know why it hurt me so much. My only memory I have with her is at soccer practice when I was wearing a spongebob shirt and she was chasing me around wanting to have my shirt. But you know, I really do miss her
-12	negative	self-harm	I lost David, the love of my life, my soul mate, my dream come true in May of 2012.  It was sudden and unexpected and completely ripped my heart out of my chest.  Someone told me several months ago that Pennies were from Heaven, I really didn't think anything of it until I actually started noticing more and more pennies in my path.  Used to be I would only pick a penny up if it were on Heads, LolChild hood idea.  But now, I look at it this way.  David throws them in my path.  When I find one, I pick it up and look up to Heaven and just smile and sometimes wink.as if to say "I am thinking about you too"  I came home one day to find about 4 pennies scattered on my kitchen floor, which to my knowledge, I had never seen before.  It was kind of cool.  So, now when I find a penny, no matter where I am, it gets picked up and stays with me.  I believe in Pennies from Heavenwithout a doubt.
-7	negative	self-harm	I lost my Mom to suicide when I was 16 months old. She was 17. I was told she was murdered. I was told a gun fell from the wall and went off by accident. I was also told that she crawled from the room where she was shot and was found lying over my body. I'm 57 years old and still grieve for her. I have accepted that I will never know what happened. She was shot in the chest. I lost my 21 year old granddaughter to a questionable suicide a few months ago. So the questions begin again. She left a two year old daughter who will grow up in the same wondering darkness that I did. Will the circle never be broken?
-1	negative	self-harm	I lost my uncle Booie in 2009 
-6	negative	self-harm	I lost one of my best friends to suicide on 23rd of October 2010. We first met in 2004 and instantly became very good friends. We shared some tough life experiences and were both battling depression and self harm. In 2004 we lived abroad together and got to know each other very well. We were great support for each other because we could always sense if something was wrong. Today I still feel the guilt of leaving here there and not beeing there for her.
-13	negative	self-harm	I lost the guy who was both my best friend and my boyfriend. He was also the father of (at the time) our unborn son. I lost the brightest person in my life. His smiles were amazing, his laughter; contagious, and his hugs; unforgettable. I will never forget him, and will always love him. He was my anchor, and I was his. We were compatible, almost soul mates. And when he died, I felt like I lost half of my heart. We had been together for 3 years. What really hurts is he texted me before he put that gun to his head He THOUGHT about me CARED enough to tell me one last time Good bye and in his own way that he loved me But the thought of me and how much he cared for me, wasn't enough to stop him. That is the worst feeling I have ever felt, that I wasn't ENOUGH. I hope to God, when our son gets old enough, he doesn't feel what I felt/feeling. That he doesn't blame himself for his dad's death, since it was so close to his birth. 
-7	negative	self-harm	I love my scars they are almost all good times. I only have a few physical external scar left from the worst times of my life. I used to claw and scratch my skin when I was stressed and lucky that never scarred. I have burn scars on my hands from rope, an accident at a school camp that left my hands scabby for weeks. I always think of it when i smell burning flesh. But it was good memories. On the way home from the excursion we stopped at mcdonalds and i couldn't even pick up my food to eat it. I was miserable and my class mates didn't want to sit near me because they didn't want to be put off their food. Then one girl came over and fed me. It was a small act that meant so much. Then I have a lot of internal scarring on my lady parts. I wont go into detail.
-10	negative	self-harm	I love them to pieces, I really do. The thing is I am living with a dysfunctional family. We yell at each other a lot, the cuss, make me feel awful about myself. On the other hand they supportive and want me to have a good life. I'm so tired of them though at 20 adult child loving in the house. Our constant back and forth, love hate relationship is exhausting.                             I hate what I'll be doing, but I'm going to leave the house tomorrow and jump onto a plane. Tickets are booked and I've been sending off a little bit of my stuff. I need to start my own life no matter where the path takes me. You know what I'll be ok too, I'll feel guilty for the emotional pain I'm going to put them though. It's my life though and I want to do whatever I decide.
-4	negative	self-harm	I'm 14 I have an eating disorder I cut myself oftenI self harm to try and feel better and it works for a while
-7	negative	self-harm	I'm 5'5 220 lbs YIKES I know.. I'm tired of being called fat & ugly I'm going to start starving tomorrow until I get down to like 160 . My boyfriend doesn't say much about my size but I can tell he doesn't like how fat I am. I'll do anything to lose this fat! I'm going to start running & eating a fruit a day or a few crackers and water I've heard people losing 30 lbs in a months by starving I would love to do that! I'm starting tomorrow and I just took a few laxatives so my stomach will be cleaned out. Any tips?
-4	negative	self-harm	I'm 5'9 and weigh 126 lbs. I really really want to weigh an even 100. I've started eating less, but I haven't completely starved myself yet. Any tips on how to loose pounds quickly?
-2	negative	self-harm	I'm about to cut myself I have such an urge I love the blade against my skin
-1	negative	self-harm	I m a fat long haired girl 
-5	negative	self-harm	I managed to stop for a while but in the back of my head I knew I craved to take out my stress and pressures and hurt out on myself. Today I gave in and I self harmed again. I have my reasons and I am ashamed of myself because I feel better for it.
-2	negative	self-harm	I'm an introvert. And observe more than you know.
-6	negative	self-harm	i'm a particularly emotional person where appropriate. such as is your average adult female. there are ideas that women feel too much or cry  easily etc etc etc but it's all nonsense to me, women simply seem to learn that emotions are okay and thus they accept, feel and express them without excessive shame. i feel badly sometimes for men who are programmed so poorly regarding emotion, having ideas such as "men do not cry" or "do not say they love you" or "do not include intimacy in friendship with other males" etc.. don't cut yourself if you're under 18, i know that's 100% sound advice always.
-11	negative	self-harm	I'm a survivor of self harming Yet in not fully recovered I first started a few years ago. I tried stop but soon came addicted to it. I felt like that was the only thing that could make me feel alive yet it is still. I have scars, and I'm not proud of them. One day in math, someone pointed them out in front of the whole class.. That was probably the most embarrassing thing that has happened yet this year And after he said it, everyone looked at me different. Which really hurt even more. People tried grabbing my arm to see and I just felt so trapped. I started a new form of hurting myself. I'd snap my pony tail against my wrist. And not very much longer, it'd start to bleed. I'm not proud, but I'm trying to stop. You become so addicted to it, it's normal. It makes me feel like I'm alive, yet I know I shouldn't. But what happens when that's the only thing that you know that is keeping you from slipping and drowning down deep into the dark ocean??
-2	negative	self-harm	I'm a very picky eater and I always eat tiny portions. Being a flyer on my cheerleading squad, there is unlimited pressure to stay thin. I eat  700-800 calories a day at most and drink lots of water, juice, and coffee. Cafeteria food at school is disgusting and I don't really eat much at home. Most of the food that my parents buy is stuff that I would never touch. This is usually junk food or greasy food that makes you fat unless they cook dinner. Even when my parents cook dinner, I hide food to make it look like it is inside of me when its not. I dont want to overeat and feel disgusting and guilty. I usually eat an apple or grapes, handful of crackers, and a bowl of cereal or oatmeal for dinner. This is like my every day diet. There are times where I need to eat but I would drink something instead. 
-2	negative	self-harm	I'm back at it again. I scratch my skin till there's a large gash, which is more painful than what a razor can do. I know, I love you too- me
-10	negative	self-harm	I'm currently 20yrs old and I live on my own with my boyfriend. I haven't seen any of my close friends in 2yrs. Most are married and have little ones..but I wish I was 5yrs old again because the real world is harder than what i thought it would be. I just want to go back in time when I didn't have bills and all this stress. I have been with my boyfriend for almost 9 monthsand it seems like we're growing apart every day..I just want to go back when all I did all day was play dress up with my older sister. I hardly ever see my sister and she's 7 or 8 weeks from having her baby.I don't get to see my parents hardly or my little brother and sister.it was so easy being a child with no cares in the world.If i could start over I would.I love my boyfriend very much but we argue a lot. I need some help!! I need someone to talk to!
-5	negative	self-harm	I'm done. I'm cutting my wrist as much as I want this time and I'm running away. I can't take this anymore. This is too much. I am so done. I'm going to cut. & no one is going to see it cause I'll be gone. All these people are so mean. I can't take it anymore.
-2	negative	self-harm	I'm done, I've had it. I wish I wasn't scared to kill myself.
-5	negative	self-harm	I'm drowning in a pool of my own blood and tears. It seems that cutting is the only thing I have left that can make me feel anything at all. Nothing else works anymore, the only reason I'm still alive is because of cutting. But I can feel it slowly losing its magic. I'm becoming immune to it just like I have with everything else in this world. I don't know how much longer it will be before its magic is gone forever. But I do know one thing, I cant live without an escape.
-1	negative	self-harm	Im going to find a razor and cut. Im sick of not having a release. I have no one to talk to. No savior.
-7	negative	self-harm	I went through some of my pictures to maybe help some of you that think you do not deserve not to be harmful to yourself that there is some reason we have to make or selves feel pain, because of something that we have done. I posted that I have cut, and have suicidal thoughts since I was 12. That may be true, but for you that don't think you can be happy at a young age, here I was in the middle of all of this and look at what I'm doing.
-4	negative	self-harm	I'm here for anyone who needs help, I've been through it & am still dealing with it.
-1	negative	self-harm	I'm holding a blade Never needing to worry about you no more..
-11	negative	self-harm	I missed another doctors appointment today, so that's 125$ I owe now Mother started screaming at me again. Lucky she isn't here to beat me. I punish myself though. I planned on just a couple of cuts, quick and shallow. I've been holding back for three months and I lost control. My entire arm is covered, as well as my stomach. I lost count. God I missed this, the adrenaline, the rush, the quiet. The voices stopped mocking me for eating, for being such a loser. God I needed this.
-3	negative	self-harm	I'm just wonder if a guy would ever accept me for who i am. What if I'm never good enough for any guy
-1	negative	self-harm	I'm like an emotional sponge. A little thing can trigger off my anxiety and it feels horrible. I don't hate my life, I just hate me. Sometimes.
-8	negative	self-harm	I'm lost- I have a "friend" who is always annoying me and calling me names. I'm very sensitive and what she says hurts me. Ive tried talking to her numerous times but it doesn't help. I told my mom and she talked to her mom and that also didnt help. She also sort of recruits more girls to bother me. She embarrasses me in front of people she thinks I'm a toy. Today she played a prank on me she told me she called a boy that I kind of like and told him I like him so he then told me that he likes me but of course it was just a jokethere are so many other things that I cant even begin to explain how much they hurt and its not just her I'm sitting on my bed deciding if I should cut or not by I'm scared to hurt myself but its also gotten to a point were there is nothing left for me to doIm just lost and have not a clue what to do 
-2	negative	self-harm	I'm my own worst enemy  This song describes me so well not joking
-5	negative	self-harm	I'm never good enough. Right now, my two bestfriends hate me because they found out I cut, my boyfriend keeps meeting up with my "bestfriend" and he put her in his bbm name. I'm only 13. And I want to die. More than anything. I have no one
-6	negative	self-harm	Im not your average teen. Who is? I have tried to commit suicide, did self harm, ran away, and been in and out of hospitals since 12. Now i have gotten way better and am ready to share what i have been through and for all of the depressed teens who thinks nobody understands im here message me.
-3	negative	self-harm	I'm over weight. And really need to put more effort into loosing weight. I want to be skinny for my High School years. Because if I thought middle school was bad, High schools going to be terrible. But that's only one of the reasons I want to be skinny. I don't like be fat. 
-3	negative	self-harm	I'm over weight. And really need to put more effort into loosing weight. I want to be skinny for my High School years. Because if I thought middle school was bad, High schools going to be terrible. But that's only one of the reasons I want to be skinny. I don't like being fat. 
-5	negative	self-harm	im really craving to selp harm please someone help non of my friends understand please please please
-1	negative	self-harm	I'm sad and I have every right to be but the people around me don't think j should be sad. They tell me to straighten up and act my age. I don't have the right to express myself.
-5	negative	self-harm	I'm scared of going to school(when it starts soon) Everyone is going to see my scars. I have tried foundation it's to noticeable and comes off when we do sport. I used to wear a black head band rapped twice around my arm, but now I have more spread out scars. And I also have a strict teacher this year who won't allow and bracelets ect. I'm not sure what to do in time for school, I have stuff to eventually heal scars but it doesn't work to well. If anyone can help me think of ideas of what to do I'd appreciate it a lot. : 
-8	negative	self-harm	Im schizophrenic and the creatures cut me but my parents say i cut during episodes. I cut when they dont leave me alone i know that much. I dont want to but they make me.
-12	negative	self-harm	I'm seriously tired of hearing people say: "it's no big deal and besides maybe they should have been stronger!" Well you know what? Maybe they were VERY strong, but you tore them all of the way down that that was their only choice because living was hurting them way too much. I can see how people think that it's selfish, cause in a way, it is. Taking such a great, beautiful, and amazing away from this world. Especially family and friends. But see, the thing is If someone is that low They think that life would be better without them. Which isn't true, but people can make them feel like that. So everyone, please Watch what you say and think before you speak. Because they may not be here for you to apologize to tomorrow.
-3	negative	self-harm	I'm so glad this group exists, and Im sure there are many more people out there who love looking at their old photos. That's why I love Polaroids - you can capture all these moments instantly. Digital cameras never really work for me, and I miss the feeling of waiting for my photos to be developed, and putting all of them in an album for later.  I miss the good old days :-) 
-2	negative	self-harm	I'm so mad at myself!! I want to stop this but I am so weak!!! Once I get the urge to I can't stop myself. I'm afraid this will control and dominate my life. I don't know how to deal with loneliness, depression, stress, and emptiness. I've tried so many methods of controlling my feelings and urges but none of them cut it. (no pun intended) The only thing that gives me immediate release and calms my storm is cutting. If anyone knows or has quit in the past, please help. It's getting out of control. I'm scared of what I might do to myself if I don't get some control back. help
-4	negative	self-harm	IM SORRY FOR what my brother did  i know it will be hard but i got an email from my brother telling me to help so if you need help in anyway i will do my best

-15	negative	self-harm	Im trapped in what seems like a beautiful garden but all are blind to the fact that the lovely flowers surrounding me are more poisonous than the deadliest snake venom. They wind and curl around me tightening until I can hardly breath. No one hears the pain in my voice or see the panic in my eyes they only see what they want to see the beautiful illusion that that surrounds me and will eventually kill me. I see it though the ugly prickly vines that resemble barbed wire and those lovely flowers are made of torn angle wings the red ones bathed in their blood. You would think it logical to try to find a way out but there is no escape and the rescuers are too entranced with the dangerous facade holding me captive. Will continue to break from my binds. 
-5	negative	self-harm	I'm trying to hard to let him go. It's been three years and it's just too much. I can't do this anymore. I have to be strong enough to let it go. I have to be strong enough to finally move on. Even if it kills me inside.
-14	negative	self-harm	In august 2012 my close friend hung himself & I just couldn't believe it. He was always happy with a smile on his face and when I heard that he passed I thought it was a mistake. I guess he was dealing with this that nobody knew about. I took it so hard , I remember the last time I heard his voice it actually was the last time we spoke & he told me that we would always be best friends & that he loved me. I truly miss him. I don't know if I can say that he's in a better place now only because I wish he was here still. But Elvis will always be my angel. He was only 25
-6	negative	self-harm	I need help and I've tried seeking help and it hasn't worked I don't know how to stop I've got to the point where I'm not telling my friends cuz they r getting so worried about it 
-7	negative	self-harm	I need help. I've been trying to stop from cutting and I've gone two weeks so far but it's getting harder to control the urges. I have no support here by family or friends, and I have so much to lose now I'd I were to cut again.
-8	negative	self-harm	I need to know that there is hope, I've been lying for years and years. I am only 21 years old and I  I'm in an extremely serious relationship with a girl that literally means everything to me.. But of course lying has gotten in the way. Tonight she told me words meant nothing from me. Completely broke my heart because I couldn't blame her. I know I have a problem and I know I want to fix it. Please help, advice please. Thanks
-1	negative	self-harm	I need to save myself, from myself. I hate cutting, but I love it. It's my favorite addiction, but the cause of my demisei can't get my nails done anymore because I'm too scared to roll up the sleeves of my shirt..It hurts to play volleyball, my favorite activity..the cuts just reopen. I deserve this
-7	negative	self-harm	I never quite recovered from my self harm experiences honestly, I remember one day my dad and I got to a point of screaming at each other I took the blade and literally just scraped it against my arm. I don't remember the pain, but I'm always having memories like that, and it bothers me so much. I have been self harming for two years now.  I don't know how long ill last before relapse, it's only been a few weeks right now. I'm scared.
-11	negative	self-harm	In February I began dating this guy. We had a lot in common, made each other laugh, and got along really well. We were having so much fun and it seemed as though we were both happy. In mid-May, he ended things with me. At first he said it was because he didn't want to be in a serious long term relationship. After talking more he admitted that he did not have the feelings for me as I did for him. We were both crying. He said he knew it would be hard but wanted to remain friends and after I told him I couldn't do that right away he cried harder. He said I was probably his best friend. Now here's my question/issue, I still have head over heels feelings for this guy. Do I tell him? If I do and he still doesn't want anything then I lose a really good friend. 
-2	negative	self-harm	In my family, depression, anxiety, and self harm is common. When I was told I had all three it didn't come as a shocker to my parents. I've known for a year now, and I've been clean of sled harm for almost 6 months now. But stuff is going on in my life, my mom has cancer and people are giving me a bunch of crap because of who I am, and I feel this hive wave of sadness wash over me on a daily basis. I really don't want to turn back to self harm, but I really don't know how else to deal with it. 
-13	negative	self-harm	In the past 2 posts, I wrote about how my husband (DH) hasn't spoken to his mother (my MIL) and father (my FIL) for 5 months. And then, how he was feeling sad for not speaking to his dad. And how we felt empathy towards his mom, but he still doesn't want to be around her because she hasn't taken ownership of her actions. So he decided to reach out to his dad because it wasn't fair to punish his dad for things his mom did. We figured DH could have a nice relationship with FIL even if DH and MIL weren't on speaking terms. So. that's it. They haven't changed. After 5 months, nothing has changed. Ridiculous.
-6	negative	self-harm	Introversion"the state of or tendency toward being wholly or predominantly concerned with and interested in one's own mental life". An introvert is likely to enjoy time spent alone and find less reward in time spent with large groups of people, though he/she may enjoy interactions with close friends. Trust is usually an issue of significance: a virtue of utmost importance to introverts is choosing a worthy companion. They prefer to concentrate on a single activity at a time and like to observe situations before they participate.  Wikipedia  
-1	negative	self-harm	I obsess over finding new way to self harm. Its riveting and unhealthy.
-2	negative	self-harm	I officially stopped self harming. My mom found out and threatened to put me in an insane asylum..so I didn't wanna risk it. She does full body checks everyday. I'm officially done !(:
-6	negative	self-harm	I overcame abusing my body when is was 12 years old. I used to cut the back of my thighs because I didn't want anyone to see my pain. I had a tough time with my home life and bullying. Things got out of my control and I panicked and began to cut myself. I regret doing that and if I could go back and re do what had happened I would. Just know that I'm here for support anyone who needs it and I wish you the best of luck and love in life 
-2	negative	self-harm	I punch myself because I'm stupid. I punch myself because I'm worthless.
-5	negative	self-harm	I really gotta learn to pay attention to these things. This is why I like cats. No cats I ever had died. . . .
-1	negative	self-harm	I really want to self harm  Please I need a friend so alone
-3	negative	self-harm	I recall being at summer camp in the Mountains for a month or so I also know most blackeyes go untreated and unreported since people are sometimes embarrassed or do not want their loved ones to get blamed even for the errant foul ball or bad pitch to the face.
-9	negative	self-harm	I recently found out I have OCD I lived with the little rituals and it was never super debilitating until I got into a relationship and it brought out some very bad insecurities mixed with intense OCD behavior. I think it contributed to the relationship ending but now I know I need help controlling my OCD. I would have never known how bad my obsessive thoughts could get if it weren't for this relationship and it's breakdown so I'm grateful for that!  I make strange noises, if I don't do something a certain way I'll think something bad will happen to someone I love, I obsess over questions and ask them over and over, and more! I can't believe I thought this was normal for so long.
-1	negative	self-harm	I relapsed. Buh-bye 178 days clean
-5	negative	self-harm	I relapsed last night and I punched the wall so hard my fist is bruised. I've been so triggered to cut lately. I used to do it all up my arm but now I don't have the energy to worry about wearing long sleeves all the time. So now, I just do it in the same one spot on my wrist I can cover with a bracelet. Or my hips, those are safe, no one will see and summer isn't for months.
-2	negative	self-harm	I reliesed recently that i am ,actually it can get very bad at times ,especially when E was gone:'(
-2	negative	self-harm	I remember the feeling of relief when I put a blade on my skin for the first time..
-1	negative	self-harm	I remember the first time i cut myself. It felt right but in reality it was so wrong. A lot of people say that people cut themselves for attention but for some cases that is not what it's about at all. I didn't cut myself on my wrists, I cut myself on my stomach and on my thighs. Depression made me do it. I didn't know what to do and I didn't know how to handle it.
-17	negative	self-harm	I remember the night my boyfriend of the time broke up with me, I slightly cut for like a week when we were dating, but that quickly faded. 8 months later when he was breaking up with me, we were both crying. Me begging him not to go and him saying I deserve better. Before he hung up he kept repeating, "promise me you won't hurt yourself." And I kept repeating that I wasn't gonna keep that promise. I cut that night and I still have the scars. That was about a year ago and every once in a while, a lot more lately I add to them. My left arm has just about had it.
-8	negative	self-harm	I remember, twice in one month two years ago, I saw in the news that two different people committed suicide and said the same thing.  That if just one person had just noticed them that day they would not have done it.  So, ever since then I just randomly smile and wave at every person I see, even when I'm driving, well not every person, but as much as I can.  
-3	negative	self-harm	I ruined an 8 year marriage by cheating on my husband and sleeping with a black man who abused me. My children hate me and I lost custody of my daughter. I can't bring myself to speak to anyome of this. I just want my life back.
-2	negative	self-harm	I see those girls at school all the time. The ones who scratch their arms, wear short-sleeved shirt, then claim to have depression just to get attention. There are millions of those kinds of people. Then there's me. That zealous, intelligent, confident girl who everyone knows. Whatever.
-8	negative	self-harm	I self harm, at times very frequently; say once or twice a day. But other times  it can be several weeks in between. I am trying to get better, i am improving. Be proud, be so, so proud that you went that long, even if just a day, without cutting.  Hold your head high and just aim for one day longer than that 3 weeks, just keep trying. You're stronger than you realise.
-1	negative	self-harm	i self harm because hats the only way i get red of the pain that goes through my head.. i dont know what to do anymore 
-2	negative	self-harm	I self harmed. Allot. I'd punch myself or kick myself but never did cut. Even the smallest amount of pain will release the same endorphins.
-7	negative	self-harm	I self harm. Lately I've just been so sad, I just stopped doing things I love. I'm dating this wonderful girl(yes I'm bi) I just want to be strong for her. I stopped cutting and burning because of her.
-4	negative	self-harm	I self harm. No two ways about it. I've done it for months now. No one knows, no one notices, no one cares. Not my "friends" not my family, not my teachers. No one. I have done it on my thighs. And my left arm, although I haven't done it for about 2 weeks now I get urges every single day. I want this all to be over.
-1	negative	self-harm	I sometimes think about committing suicide but I know that I can't leave my two best friends behind..
-11	negative	self-harm	I started about 6 months ago, a 'friend' told me and taught me how to do it. I did it once a week maybe for about a month but then some girls at my school noticed, they'd laugh at me and call me depressed and silly names. It was at this point where self harm was daily for me, for about 12 weeks I would self harm everyday, then I was clean, I didn't self harm for a whole month, but recently from the start of December I've started doing it again, I mainly slash my wrists of my stomach area. Do I need help?!
-7	negative	self-harm	I started a couple years ago when i accidentally burned my arm with the flat iron but now its like. i love the way it feels and im addicted to the feel of the burn and tge rush it gives me  im addicted to fire. the look. the feel when i slide my thumb down to light it. its scary and unhealthy and i know but i cant stop 
-16	negative	self-harm	I started cutting around he age of 12 and it became my addiction I had cut for 2 years straight, everyday. Then i met a good friend of mine he helped me through it and i stopped for about 3 months and i would go through horrible withdrawal I would have panic attacks and cry out of nowhere and for a while when i got the urge i would dig my nails into my own skin until it left nail marks so deep most of them bled. Then while i was trying to quit i carried a rubberband around with me all the time and whenever i wanted to cut i would snap myself repeatedly until i had dark red marks that would last days on my skin. I'm doing good this year&lt;3 i have managed to keep clean since my birthday&lt;3 My birthday wasn't the best and i ended up with 16 new cuts but only a few scarred but I've been clean 5 months and 7 days! I feel proud of myself even though times are tough at the moment i'm trying to stay strong and not break down&lt;3 Well thanks to those who are listening, It means alot.
-2	negative	self-harm	I started cutting at age 10. Even by then i'd been through so much, but, that rush that release from cutting filled my mind with euphoria. 
-10	negative	self-harm	I started cutting at a very young age. 9 or 10, i think. I'm 16 now, I stopped cutting over a year ago. Though, I still have my "moments." It got so bad to where my mom would have to hide the knives and the razors, so I would use anything. The cutting, it made the pain stop, In a weird way. I stopped cutting on my wrists because people saw so I went to my thighs & chest & stomach. It's horrible. The scars have faded, but are still noticeable. Today, I regret doing it, because it's made me so insecure about taking off my clothes. No one should ever feel like they have to turn to a blade to make them happy.
-1	negative	self-harm	I started cutting myself again.  I'm so depressed, afraid, and worthless.  I also have to stay up all night to study and work on my college work.  This will be a long night for me and my blade.
-19	negative	self-harm	I started doing drugs when I was 14. I used to do just marijuana sporadically because my friends pressured me into it. Then a guy I was extremely close to passed away, and I decided to try drugs to see if it helped with the pain. And it did for a while. I tried pills and cocaine at first, but then as time went on I started to do heroin. At 16, I remember I couldn't go a day without doing heroin or else I would be physically incapable of doing anything. I started doing bad in school and lost some friends, all the while I was in a depression from the loss of my friend. Thankfully I met another guy who I started to date, so the happiness from that greatly cut me back on the drug use. I quit cold turkey one day, became pregnant a short while later, and since I was pregnant that gave me the motivation to stay sober. I get cravings every now and then but my son is what keeps me going and sober. 
-4	negative	self-harm	I started in May of 2013 then I realized that this isn't how I should be handling my problems after three months. I was clean for about four months until yesterday. I did it again and the messed up part about it is that my SISTER caused me to do it. Family is supposed to make you feel good about yourself and love you, not make you hate yourself more than you already do.
-2	negative	self-harm	I started scratching at my skin at the young age of 10. I was living in a house where I was the target of the domestic abuse. I would scratch and scratch at my wrists until they bled every night.  I still struggle everyday not to pick up my razor and cut myself. It is an ongoing battle, but eventually one day I will be able to say I haven't self harmed for a year or ten years  
-2	negative	self-harm	I started self harming at the age of 13. I'm 16 now, and still continue every know and then when I feel like things are just too much. But what really makes me mad is when people assume we self harm for attention. If we wanted attention, why would we be hiding the cuts and scars we don't want people to find out about? Tell me that!  People who self harm do it for relief, they need a way to cope. It's not for freaking attention.
-6	negative	self-harm	I started self harming in 6th grade - my first year of middle school. I count myself lucky because I've never really been bullied My self harm stemmed from self-hate, anxiety, depression, parental issues etc. It started with harsh snaps on my wrist and thighs with thick hair elastics, digging my nails into my skin, lip-biting, etc. As my self harm escalated I started to take apart my razors. I started with small cuts and then gradually got deeper This went on until halfway through year 8.  Thank you for taking the time to read my story 
-14	negative	self-harm	I started self injuring the summer of 2003. I was 12 years old. I was bullied throughout the 5th and 6th grade which caused me to become very depressed and suicidal. I remember reading an article about self injury on a website for a teen magazine. In the article they mentioned as a reason as to why people do this is because physical pain brings relief from emotional pain. Even though I was out of the school and away from those who bullied me the depression and the pain from it remained so I tried self injury. I snuck into the kitchen one night and grabbed a kitchen knife. I did my first cut that night and from that moment on I was hooked. One little cut here and there and it escalated as the years went by.  Thank you for taking the time to read my story and feel free to comment and ask questions.
-10	negative	self-harm	I started to self-harm when I was 10 years old. I started cutting and hitting my head repeatedly on objects at school like the desk the walls ect  I continued cutting until I was 15 I remember the words I cut into my arms all the scars lining both my legs. The bruises on my back from giving myself the belt. I couldn't escape the pain I loved it so much, that rush, the taste on my fresh blood as it poured from my arms. I stopped almost 3 years ago because I thought I didn't need it. But today that changed i started beating myself up again literally giving myself the belt, punching myself in the jaw and elbowing my legs. I have alternative to cutting where I just gently run the blade over my skin. I tried so hard to stop but I realize I need the pain and I need to be the cause. 
-10	negative	self-harm	I started very young, with small scratches and it became progressively more severe. It was a release for the pain, frustration and fear I felt and it served a purpose at the time. I'm grateful that I found it within myself to stop for good, when I was around 19 or 20. I tried a lot of different ways to deal with what I was feeling, not all of them very healthy. The most effective for me was writing; start a journal and get it all out of your system and onto paper. And learn to breathe deeply from your stomach, it's actually the same release. If anyone's still struggling with this, feel free to message me and talk about anything.
-4	negative	self-harm	I started when I was about 13, I am now 18 and it got to a point where it didn't give me the same amount of comfort and so I stopped, but tonight it just started happening and the calm came back immediately. I am scared that it will happen again now that it helps again
-9	negative	self-harm	I starve myself becuz I long for a skinny body. I used to have one but then a diagnosis called PCOS hit me then I started gaining weight and for some reason a part of my internal organs produces it's own Insulin, which results to me getting fat and gaining weight without eating much and it stresses me. Sometimes I just eat Nerds all day, like a piece or two and I couldn't even finish the whole box (the tiniest one). However, I do drink a lot of h2o and Iced Tea.
-7	negative	self-harm	I stopped for the most part, getting all the help that i need. But one of the reasons i decided to quit was because i was getting older and i was wanted to do things like donate blood, but i couldn't with nasty cuts all over my arms, or so that going to the doctor wouldn't be so awkward. Thanks for reading.
-7	negative	self-harm	I take a deep breath and if I haven't cried by the end if the day it's a good day. I haven't cried yet today and I think I am doing ok
-5	negative	self-harm	It all started when i was born. June 30,1997 at 11:19 pm. I was born a miracle child. Only 1 pound and 7 ounces. They said i wouldn't make it but i'm here now. I have alot of scars from surgery but the one i was the most insecure about was the one on my stomach. It goes all the way across the front but i learned to embrace it. Because know i'm so happy i'm blessed. I have many more scars but
-4	negative	self-harm	It brings me pleasure . Seeing the blood run down my arms and drip on the floor releases all the Anger and sadness for a split second . I am not ashamed of my scars nor am I proud of them but they remind me what I have made it through and that the pain goes away &lt;3
-4	negative	self-harm	It burns and stings but I honestly don't care. I did it with a knife repeatedly until I drew blood and started feeling better about myself. The only problem is that I don't feel better. I feel worse because I haven't cut myself in three years and am so ashamed that I broke my streak. I thought I was over this but obviously I'm not
-1	negative	self-harm	It burns under the shower. about.
-5	negative	self-harm	I tend to fall in love with unavailable older people. Last time it was a college professor now I'm in love with my female boss. How do you deal with being denied something you want?
-2	negative	self-harm	I tend to put myself in a place of responsibility, so it is really easy for me to feel like Im to blame for everything that goes wrong. If Im in charge, its my fault because Im in charge. If Im not, its my fault because I didnt do anything about it. Its always my fault.
-2	negative	self-harm	It got bad again.  I needed to vent I guess..
-1	negative	self-harm	it had happened so many times. and still cant find my first love and im 16 sometimes I think it will never happen.like im destined to be forever alone. 
-14	negative	self-harm	It has been 1 year since I've self-harmed and I could not be more proud. I had been cutting and burning myself everyday for almost 4 years and I finally found the strength to stop. I took everyday minute by minute because for me my self-harm was an addiction. If I could get through 1 minute, that minute was in the past and I could focus on the next. Instead of thinking I'm never gonna cut again I took every second of everyday to not do it. It's been a year and I'm so happy. I had someone once say to me "treat your body as if it was a child". My body wouldn't be functioning if I didn't take care of it at all. Giving up self-harm has given me such strength I'm here for anyone that wants to talk or get some advice or just vent. Stay strong &lt;3
-23	negative	self-harm	It has been 4 1/2 years since my son passed away.  I decided to make some major changes in my life. I have moved from southern California to the state of Washington. This is where my son's son, my grandson, now lives and I intend to stay as close to him as possible. My grandson seems to appreciate my being nearby and I'm pretty sure my son would approve.: ) I continue to miss and pray formy son everyday. But I have decided to take care of my health and to enjoy whatever time I have left on Earth. I have not experienced the death of anyclose friends or familyrecently (knock wood) and that helps.Parker's death still hurts. Istill cry for him. But Iknow I will see him again one day, when it is my time. Until then, I pray, I think of him, I miss him, I know he is with God and I know he is watching over his son and me. That's all I can ask for. 
-8	negative	self-harm	I think I am a pathological liar.  Naturally, when it was read out loud I knew that she was talking about me (the kleptomania part gave it away because we had coincidentally bought the same blanket but she couldn't find hers and because I couldn't find the receipt she thinks I took hers which I PROMISE I didn'tpetty and stupid, I know, but she took great offense to it and stole it from my room) and started analyzing the liar part. I knew I was prone to lying but it has gotten out of hand. I lie about my entire life and I want to stop. I'm not looking for someone to help me stop, I just need someone to share this with because I think just talking to someone and being able to tell them that I told a lie might help me. I really want people to be able to trust the words that are coming out of my mouth so now I've come here in hopes that I'll find someone who is also a liar and we can share with each other because after tons of research I am pretty sure that I am a pathological liar. 
-6	negative	self-harm	I thought I was over this, out grown it. But turns out its always been there, at the back of my mind whenever something just ticks me off,  I reach for the blade. I've named it Jane. I've never had a jane in my life, she sounds reliable. Makes a change,  considering everyone I've known has let me down at some stage in my life. Ironic right?  Well she sits there on my bed, all day and all night. My only company, my only friend. 
-12	negative	self-harm	it just i don't like me , not all the time but sometime it just like why i m like this i just hate myself for being such a fool  i m shy no not just shy i m too much of it i cant talk to girls properly unless i know them for a year , only have one female friend . she is my only best friend but she lives far away so i can only talk to her twice a week . In my college i have no best friend whom i can share my problems , i live in hostel so i never find myself alone and its like i standing in a crowd of thousands and still dont know a single person . i know its all my fault it me who dont know how to make friends .. 
-3	negative	self-harm	I told myself if I didn't do anything I could cut at midnight on New Year's Eve. I celebrate 2014 with 2,014 cuts across the thigh, euphoric if you ask me.
-9	negative	self-harm	I tried to commit suicide last February when things were really hard for me. I lost all of my friends and my family wasn't around much but things are starting to get better for me now but I was wondering if anyone has any ideas on how to stop cutting. I've been doing it since I was in seventh  grade and I really want to stop but it still happens a lot. 
-21	negative	self-harm	I tried to OD on the 16th. I only remember taking the first few pills. Then I guess I ended up taking 1 bottle of Motrin pm 1 bottle of Tylenol pm and two bottles of Benadryl. I guess I called the hospital. I was in the parking lot there anyway. So, they said they called the police and ambulance and stuff. I only remember waking up two times in the ICU (I was there 5 days) and I had tubes coming into me from everywhere and one sewn into my neck. After that I went inpatient for 8 days. I have been self harming since I was young. But, ODing and then having such a tragedy come from it, I am going to try saying it is going to be a thing of the past. I haven't done it or felt like it since the 28th when I left the hospital. I hope it stays that way.
-6	negative	self-harm	I tried to start the New Year without any new scars..that didn't go well. 5 more. But I think it will get better I hope. I just have so much stress and being not aloud to be in my little brothers life is like the worst thing ever. I don't understand my life all it is, is pressure, stress, restless nights, teary eyes, sad thoughts, I just need relief my life is a pain. i'm feeling like I just going through the motions and I'm not even living life. 
-1	negative	self-harm	I truly do. I like the escape, because I'm usually alone all the time. Sigh.
-6	negative	self-harm	I try not to and usualy dont. I did it way to deep whn i was 16 and it really put me off and was so shame to go to the hospital and make up it was an accident. scars are ugly, i try and remember that.
-1	negative	self-harm	It's a constant battle. I'm dealing with it now, and not letting it control me 
-1	negative	self-harm	It's becoming stronger than me.
-13	negative	self-harm	it's been 16 years since my brother committed suicide I believe that my late brother hasn't left me completely, he's my guardian angel. One winter I was driving and someone told me "go straight" so I did. As I was driving my vehicle went sideways - I started crying because I noticed the trucks behind me were gone, they decided to drive up the hill before I went sideways.
-5	negative	self-harm	It's been a week since I last cut myself!!! I have had a very hard time with this and always have to have something in my hand to keep me from cutting. I hope I can go longer without cutting 
-3	negative	self-harm	It's been a while since I last posted in here, things have changed. I need help. I'm tired of feeling this way.
-11	negative	self-harm	It's been many years since I last self-harmed. And I still have the scars to show, although I hide them under wristbands that I wear almost every day. Hardly anyone knows of what I put myself through. I cut myself too deep once and damaged the vein in my arm so every so often, I just feel pains in my wrist from where I cut. I last myself when I was 15 and I'm now 21. I never thought of using bio-oil or anything to get rid of the scars, cause I always wanted them to be visible as a reminder of where I once was, and to promise myself I wouldn't go there again. It's not been easy and even to this day, I sometimes think of draining out the pain of existence and depression with a cut here or there, but I know it can't solve anything. I just try and live through what's going on around me as best I can, as that's all I seem to do.  Apologies if I appear whiny or self-loathing. I have a habit of being like that sometimes.
-11	negative	self-harm	It's been over a year since I have cut perhaps maybe even longer. However, there is hardly even a day that goes by when I don't think about doing it and picture doing it. It feels so wonderful and it removes so much guilt. I've talked to professionals before, and they always say I should try to focus on doing something else to make me feel better, but nothing else makes me feel better unless it's another kind of self injury or punishment. It feels like I will be battling this the rest of my life, but I don't see the point of battling it. It isn't so bad. I'm not trying to kill myself. I'm just trying to relieve guilt. I don't see why people can't just let me do it. I'm not hurting anybody else. 
-6	negative	self-harm	Its been two years. Two years since Ive felt your touch, your kisses..felt your arms wrapped around me.  Time has made the ache lessen, but its still there.  I miss you more than I can say.  I miss your touch, the sound of your voice.  Part of me knows that it is better this way, for both of us, but I still love you.  Id give up almost anything to have you back again.  Ive been strong, but there are so many times Ive wanted to crawl back to you, beg you to give us another try.  So many things remind me of you.  Rainy days when we stayed in bed all day.  Hikes in the woods with Chloe. ( I know that she still misses you too. )  Mexican food, pizza, even making the bed.   CLG
-2	negative	self-harm	It scary I think about it but I never it done it before.  Though I continue to think about it,  I try my best to control my self so I don't.  
-1	negative	self-harm	It's Christmas, and what am I doing? Carving up my body.
-6	negative	self-harm	It seems like every other story here is about people who had their lives nearly ruined by drug abuse. I still use drugs occasionally, but responsibly, and I've never run up against a problem. I have a job. I pay rent. I go to college and I'm very intelligent. I also happen to do drugs. I think they can be very mind-opening if you go into it with a respect for yourself and the substance you're using, if you educate yourself on what you're putting into your body and what precautions to take, and if you are able to set hard lines for yourself. I love drugs but if I don't have the money or I feel like I haven't been sober often enough, I don't do them and it's that simple.
-2	negative	self-harm	It's getting worse and worse every time I do it, I get deeper and deeper but I can't stop it's like an addiction. This time I have done it worse than ever, blood is pouring down my arms and I can hardly move them, they are so sore and I don't know what to do anymore. I feel so lost in this pit of depression that is swallowing me in further each time I do it but at the same time I get satisfaction out of it and I have no emotion.
-10	negative	self-harm	It's hard to think happy things about yourself when you have everyone in your ear telling you how horrible you are. How lazy you are. Selfish and self-centered. Stupid, fat and a waste of time and space. It really makes it hard to love yourself when you know all these things are true  I'm in the middle of a war. I will either win, or die trying. What you see on my wrists are just small battle wounds. If you could read my mind, you would be in tears . . . .
-7	negative	self-harm	It's not like I cut because I like pain. I don't like pain. I don't know why but I like to watch blood trickle down my forearm. red lines. never been too deep. when I think I can't handle pain, I stop. I was clean for a few months before I started to cut again. I was so frustrated so I cut. just to see my skin opening up. sometimes I couldn't control myself but I never went too far. the itchy feeling from the wounds when they are healing. the more I try to hold back from scratching them, the more excited I get. 
-3	negative	self-harm	It started the summer before 8th grade. I couldnt take it anymore. So I sliced my wrist open. i enjoyed the feeling & I felt better. Since then I would do it then stop and repeat. But since like October or November I havent done it.
-2	negative	self-harm	it started when I was 12 when my grandfather and best friend died of cancer and I was so mad and sad it was hard for me dealing with the pain of loosing someone so important to me. I couldn't handle it so I resulted to using a x-acto knife on my arm and it made me feel good because someone else wasn't hurting me. After awhile I was feeling a little better so I stopped. Then this year I don't know when it started but people where really making me feel like crap and I was worthless and I resulted back to self-harming, first burning but now both burning and cutting, because i am worthless and i feel a little relief when I do if people can hurt me then why cant I?
-1	negative	self-harm	Its tough. It seems no one understands and guess what? Most won't understand. For most it is unthinkable to even place a blade to ones skin. Unthinkable to even have that thought. Scary enough to keep to yourself. After all do you want the be crazy?  
-2	negative	self-harm	It was hard but I stopped I think about going back to it everyday but I don't I'm better than that
-7	negative	self-harm	It was never planned. My friends look at me and think I'm perfectly stable and happy, but they have no idea what goes on in my head. I have self harmed everyday for over 6 months now. I can't even tell anyone anymore because they call me stupid. They don't understand what it's like being abused as a child and being blamed for it and not believed. Does anyone have similar experiences.. Please share. I want to know that I am not alone.
-8	negative	self-harm	I used to abuse my body. I cut, i hit, i punch walls just to feel pain. But then i realized how stupid i was. Appreciate your body, what you have. Appreciate what God has given you. If you feel like cutting i suggest you get a journal and express your feelings in the journal instead of cutting.  Say no to cutting 
-5	negative	self-harm	I used to be self-conscious about who I was, because I didn't know who I was. I felt like many different people rather than one whole one. Perhaps all of the pieces together are the whole.  Turns out I'm a jack of all trades.
-2	negative	self-harm	I used to cut. You scare me.
-1	negative	self-harm	I used to cut but now I burn because burning myself is to much more painful and I deserve to feel pain.
-6	negative	self-harm	I used to cut habitually. I'm so ashamed of my scars because I want to work with youth and feel like that might influence them in unhealthy ways. When I tan in the summer they turn dark and are very visible. Yet I cannot help but be proud that these scars show I have come so far from rock bottom even though things are hard.
-4	negative	self-harm	I used to cut myself and this is really hard to admit. I saw it as a flaw and still do, Im afraid of what people will think if I ever showed them.
-6	negative	self-harm	I used to cut myself with knives, scissors, even staples to just distract myself for a little while My parents and family started getting suspicious about the cuts and I'd lie and say my cat did it with her claws but the lie stopped working after a while. I stopped cutting although the urges were still there. They were so hard to control. I don't know how I managed to go so long without cutting, but I did. Every time I'm depressed or have the urge, I let my cat do it for me. My parents and family believe me now and so does all my friends. Sometimes I wish I could just stop though
-4	negative	self-harm	I used to cut when I was a teen, it was pretty bad. I stopped and learned to love my scars, even if people look weird at me I'm proud of them and that I'm still alive after going through that depression, for me they're my tattoos (:
-2	negative	self-harm	I used to self harm. Allot. And yesterday and today I really wanted to. I was super depressed and it took everything to keep myself from cutting. Idk how much long I can keep it up
-4	negative	self-harm	i used to self harm but the brother of my friend stoped me, he is overprotective now, is nice but he is like a policeman, not like my friend :S
-3	negative	self-harm	I used to self harm. It was a 4 year addiction. I went to treatment for it and then recently i relapsed. 
-5	negative	self-harm	I used to self harm, sometimes I still have urges. It's not something to joke about, it's a serious thing. If anyone self harms just know, that I love you, and you are a strong person.
-4	negative	self-harm	I Used To Starve MySelf When I Was 10(Im 14 Now) Because I Thought I Wasnt Skinny Enough. At The Time I Was 99 Pounds And Dropped To About 80.
-7	negative	self-harm	I use to cut myself. I can remember my first cut and the feeling that came with it. I cut for about a year and I wanted to stop so badly! I decided to rest myself and see how long I could go without cutting. I rid of my blades so I wouldn't be tempted and I went day by day and it became a permanent thing.
-5	negative	self-harm	I've always blamed myself for everything. Especially my brother and friends raping me for 6 years straight. And, my ex boyfriend killing himself, I already knew that was my fault because I worried him so much with my issues. These things eat at me constantly because they're my fault. I've always blamed myself.
-2	negative	self-harm	I've been a cutter since I was 12 years old. My life isn't the worse, but i didn't have the greatest childhood. Cutting got rid of the pain.
-13	negative	self-harm	I've been clean for 160 days and I want to cut so bad. My self harm used to be really bad. My freshman year I cut once a day for 3 months and then I was clean for 2 years. I cut again my junior year 3 times a day for 4 months. I cut on my inner left leg and one day I cut a flower. I have white scars which is good when its not sunny. When the sun is out they show a lot. I hate them so much. I hate myself for cutting but I want to do it again. I want to break. 160 days is nothing when I was once clean for 2 years so that just makes me want to cut even more. I just want to die honestly i'm just scared of failing. Trying not to break but idk if i'll last
-6	negative	self-harm	I've been clean from any cut in 3 years.Okay,thats a lie.Ha.The truth is I rarely cut now.I do wish I can cut a lot like last time but reality is difficult.I have a job now.But it makes me sad when I dont have any real friends.The thing is I dont need to cut myself because the lonely is slowly killing me.Just triple times slower than cutting my wrist.I can still remember the first time,I started to do it.It turned out,I'm addicted to it until I can't stop.Once you start to cut,you barely stop.Plus razors are cheaper than any drugs.Just saying
-5	negative	self-harm	I've been clean from self harm for almost 4 months now and I was really proud but I just broke my streak again and I relapsed. I'm not proud at all and I feel selfish because I know it's not right I just couldn't take the urge anymore. I couldn't take all the stress or all the anger getting thrown my way from people. I felt worthless even though I know I'm not. I threw my proudness all away. Oh well there's always another chance to become clean right?
-1	negative	self-harm	I've been cutting and burning off and on for 4 and a half years now..
-4	negative	self-harm	I've been doing good with not harming myself. It's so hard though. I've done it since 6th grade. It turned into an addiction every now and then I get a strong  urge to hurt myself.
-6	negative	self-harm	i've been fighting this for weeks now and it's getting harder and harder. i'm literally on the edge..cutting was my way out,it was my way of dealing with things,it helped me so much and now.. they took it from me and i have nothing. it's like i don't exist. they took the main part of me and i can't find myself anymore. the urge is harder to deal with it and i. i can't do it,i need to cut. i need to find myself again.
-6	negative	self-harm	I've been going through some particularly difficult times at the moment in the usual infj ways but it always gives me so much comfort to rediscover my infj-ness here and it makes me remember that it's a pretty unique and special world to inhabit.  at times it can be hard not to despair and become caught up with the endless anxiety and suffering we stir up in ourselves but knowing there are others out there who just get like me is pretty wonderful 
-6	negative	self-harm	I've been having terrible nightmares lately. I'm stressed with school and work. I'm tired and overwhelmed with life and on top of it all I've been having really bad withdrawals lately. I just want to cut so bad. The temptation is everywhere. The triggers are everywhere. The feeling is almost constant.  How do you guys deal with it? How do you stay strong when all you feel like doing is relapsing? 
-14	negative	self-harm	I've been in treatment for the past three years trying to manage major depression, social anxiety and disordered eating/over-exercising behaviors. When I feel overwhelmingly out of control or empty or intensely stressed, the routines I have which typically help me to cope aren't as effective and I turn toward destructive behaviors. I have numerous scars mainly on my arms and shoulders from self-injuring. Thankfully I haven't been so unwell as to hurt myself in the ways I have anytime recently, but I have had thoughts return every now and then. I'm still far from where I'd like to be as far as recovering a life for myself, but I still have hope and therapy has been a very good experience for me.      
-19	negative	self-harm	I've been self harming for about three years now and it took my best friend to get me to stop. It's a daily struggle for me to not reach for the razor but I'm trying. This is my third attempt at trying to stop but it's hard to when you have no one around for support and your best friend lives far. I don't have a family and the people I live with don't really care. Their only concern is that i don't die in their house because then, they'll have to answer to the law. My father completely ignores me and my mother tries but she's just too far away to make any real difference. I've never really had any luck when it comes around to friends or even guys, so I try to stay by myself. I don't want to but it's less painful. If i stay single, I feel lonely and unwanted and eventually cut and if i have a BF, I still cut. So what does it matter if I'm single or not? I really want to stop but i really can't. I'm on the verge of reaching for the razor but I'm fighting with all i have to stop.
-3	negative	self-harm	I've been self harming for almost a year now, it started February 1st, 2013. I'm now trying to recover, though I don't think I'll get very far. I'm also suicidal, though I've never attempted-I've wanted to many times.
-13	negative	self-harm	I've been self harming since a young age At first it started out as cutting but slowly I started burning myself too. I always tell people that I'm fine when in fact I just want to scream I'm not. In terms of being functional I wouldn't say I am. My day consists of finding somewhere where I can be alone so I can cut or burn That's the one and only thing my mind can focus on. When I finally get to do so my mind shifts from quickly taking care of it and then back to needing to do it again. It doesn't stop it never goes away. It's always there like the only thing in that moves around my mind is self harm. Its only a matter of time before it all goes too far. Im not functional I'm destructive. 
-1	negative	self-harm	I've been sober from that addiction for 3 years now. And I want to relapse. I am so stressed out.
-3	negative	self-harm	I've been so stressed lately & I turned to self harm. I want/need it to stop but I love the rush or the feel of itplease someone tell me other ways to get this feeling! I don't want to have more scars.  Thanks
-12	negative	self-harm	Ive been starving myself since may! Ive lost 4stone 2pounds and I feel proud of myself, other people praise me and say how fab I look but deep down I feel like a fraud.. I do some Excercise but no where near as much to justify my weight loss. When I have to eat I will but when I feel it going in to my empty tummy it makes me feel horrid, I wait until im alone drink loads of water then il throw it up.  Ive had 2 children and often they ask me why I dont eat? I say I already have or will eat later :-( im lying! My boyfriend loves my weight loss but every time I try on a new size 10 an he praises me, im lying! Staving yourself is silly and I believe extremely lazy but it does work for a quick fix. I fall asleep now in random places, am always dizzy and get confused and I feel so weak. I wish I cud just start eatting again but I can't seem to :-( I wouldnt advise anyone to start starving, its a selfish and a lie :'( 
-2	negative	self-harm	I've been struggling with cutting myself for awhile now. I'm planning on doing it tonight too. );
-3	negative	self-harm	Ive been trying to starve myself recently, but it's been so hard for me! I can't stop eating and I wish I had some self control. I just want to be skinny really bad. I hate how my thighs touch. Let me just say that I'm not over weight. I'm 130 which is good for my height and age, but it's not good enough for me. Any tips on how to not be hungry or to have more self control?
-1	negative	self-harm	I've been waiting to get this off my chest for.. far too long.  All I need is help.. suggestions on what I could do.. please..
-1	negative	self-harm	I've cut for almost 4 years
-1	negative	self-harm	i've done it this time, i've pushed him away, he hates me, he wasn't supposed to find out, and now he hates me. i don't deserve to have someone like him there. hes never going to talk to me again, i am a failure, why can i never do things right? 
-4	negative	self-harm	Ive finally gotten a belly, and some moobs. It feels great and, actually quite comfy! My belly spills on to my lap, and my shirts are getting tight. Its a great sensation when you have this padding all over your body. Its pretty cozy. Anyways, bye. Thanks!
-9	negative	self-harm	I've gone 2 weeks without self harming and I'm feeling fairly confident about extending my record. The urges are still unbearably strong, but I am fighting with every ounce of will-power in me. In the process though, I lost what I thought to be my best friend. It was a toxic relationship and I had to let go of it. But being the toxic relationship it was, the other party didn't seem to be hurt by it. I have also lost touch of many of my friendships and I am trying to rekindle them, but the goal is the same, to quit my self destruction.
-2	negative	self-harm	I've had my battle and I've had my wars. But now I have many scars.  I dread seeing them
-19	negative	self-harm	I've lost many people I love in my life, both family and friends. The pain never goes away you just learn to live with the emptiness their absence leaves in your heart. Some you can at least say they lived a long and good lifebut for some that is just not the case. In Jan he was in a terrible accident, we didn't know if he'd even survive. But he improved, slowly day by day there was improvement. We rejoiced that in March he was still with us for his 21st birthday. He still had such a long and hard road ahead of him. Then toward the end of April, God decided Zach had fought long enough and He took my precious cousin home. I was able to make the trip to the funeral, the one and only time I ever saw that handsome face other than pictures, and it was a wonderful full military service. For me the loss is something I will never get over, I have moved on, (still shedding many tears almost daily though) but the place in my heart that Zachary claimed will forever be empty. 
-6	negative	self-harm	I've never cut myself deep enough to leave scars, it's not that I don't want to, I'm just frightened.  Lately I've been using safety pins, keys, and my own nails to create cuts and once they are there I enjoy looking at them every once in a while.  I've tried to stop but when something goes bad it is an automatic reaction for me. I like having the marks there, it reminds me that I can control something even if it isn't healthy for me.  My boyfriend tells me to stop and that it makes him sad when I do it, and I've tried to stop, for him, but I can never manage to.  I'm disappointed in myself that I can't stop, which makes me cut more.
-7	negative	self-harm	I've only stooped to this level once. Before that time, I never understood it. But I see why now. It really is relieving. You don't feel it like pain. It's like a release. Like a high. The mental pain is too overwhelming and masks the physical pain. It doesn't hurt. It feels good.  I've felt this enjoyable experience once. Other times I've tried, I couldn't tolerate the pain. But recently I've gotten the urge to try again, to feel that same release I felt before. I need that high again. It felt so amazing.
-3	negative	self-harm	I've planned it. I'm cutting tonight. As deep as I can go.
-12	negative	self-harm	Ive suffered with the effects of BPD for years without knowing what it was. Just recently got diagnosed and it all made sense to me why i am the way i am. More recently ive noticed that cannibis helps me to slow down my reaction time so that i dont reach angry and violent. I can focus on the emotion that triggers the anger and deal with that. I can also use humor and satire to ease the tension and relax, so i don't hurt the people in my life that i care about. I am a solid supporter of medicinal marijuana for BPD symptoms. But i still maintain an understanding that counselling and therapy (DBT) is a better way to get to the root of the problem. I am currently trying to find a doctor who can understand this and help me to get a medicinal user card in my area.
-9	negative	self-harm	I've triedI really have. But what would you have done if u felt like the walls were closing in on you???Yeah, I panicked and the first thing i might have reached for was the razor, but so what???..Who gives a rat's head about what i do??? I guess I'm once again on my own..
-5	negative	self-harm	I want to cut so bad but I can't because of a doctor appointment in a few weeks it won't heal in time. It's a melanoma check cause my dad has it and its something that can be genetic. So they are gonna check every inch if my body  all I want is to bleed a little
-3	negative	self-harm	I want to get rid of my scars but sometimes I feel like thats what keeps me going like it reminds me you didn't die for a reason. I found this really neat idea of putting a meaningful tattoo over it. Im not sure if I should do it. I always find my self hiding it or touvhing the scarred skin.
-2	negative	self-harm	I want to give up. Im one week clean and cant hold back anymore
-7	negative	self-harm	I want to help this girl out. Or at least I think I do. I'm not sure if I'm even right. I think she may be self harming. But I don't know if I'm 100 percent certain. A week ago she was hiding her arm a lot. I did that in the exact same manner that she did. So maybe I'm wrong? I'm just seeing a lot of similarity. I don't just want to do nothing about it. I think that's wrong I want to be 100 percent sure. But that seems like its gonna be impossible now. I don't have a clear line of sigh anymore. Ugh im just frustrated and confused. 
-2	negative	self-harm	I want to tell you all about my wonderful dog. I keep trying to write his story but it is too painful. It's been 7 months and I can't even talk about it yet. But I am cannot sleep because I just can't stop crying and I am just hoping there is someone who can understand. xx
-13	negative	self-harm	I was 10. Gradually my embarrassment took over my "habit " of self mutilation.One day I stopped.I was 11.And I never looked back.I stopped once and for all.But the scars remained.I still have some dark marks on my face reminding me constantly of what I had done to myself.I see it whenever I see myself.Its a part of me;ugly, but still me.And I'm learning to live with it.Happy, however, that I could have done a lot of worse things to myself and I didn't. Thanks to all the people who looked at me like a loser.And thanks to my will to try to not be seen as one.I survived.
-11	negative	self-harm	I was 11 when my grandmother gifted me my Dog "SNOWY"he was my first pet dog n i loved him unconditionallyhe used to wake me up in d morning he used to wait wid me at my bus stop for my school bus..we grew up together for almost 5 years..bt den my some one in my family felt sick n blamed snowy..n det sent him away from me last summr..bt i still miss him..n i shed a tear every once in a whilen now im left wid no pet..no dog no snowy
-6	negative	self-harm	I was 18 when I voluntarily admitted myself to a mental hospital recommended to me by my psychologist. It was a time of pain and depression in my life, and I had no where else to really go.  Only three years ago, I couldn't imagine life without her, but I'm living it right now. I am no longer depressed. I have learned to be happy over the years, and i am always sad for my friend. Its a paradox of emotions that can only truly happen once someone loses someone they loved beyond reasoning. You live happily for your deceased loved ones, and you cry for them all the same. 
-15	negative	self-harm	I was 9 when my Uncle shot himself. We were always really close. He was my godparent and every Sunday afternoon he'd take me out to get ice cream and to the zoo. He always seemed so happy and full of life, but having been so close to him I knew how desperate he really felt. When he died he left me a note. My Aunt was mad at me because she hadn't gotten a note and my family found it weird that I had revieved one but I didn't care because I was so proud that he wrote me one. On it he said 'Sunday ice-creams and the zoo with my little girl. Probably the only thing that kept me going for so long. Stay precious, I love you.' I keep the note with me at all times and it always makes me cry.
-5	negative	self-harm	I was a victim of psychopathic stalking, and when it was happening it really took a toll on me. I felt very guilty and responsible for the persons state of mind, which put me into a depression as well as self harm. I didn't severely self harm, just a couple mild cuts here and there. I was also gaining a lot of weight during the time and was very unhappy with my appearance. I am happy now, and would never think to self harm ever again. But those of you who are can talk to me. No I don't think you are seeking attention. No I don't think you're crazy. No I don't think you are a bad person. I would love to help you, and listen to you. No you are not wasting my time, yes I care about your health. Come to me whenever you feel like you can't take it anymore. Or if you just don't know why your feeling this way.
-2	negative	self-harm	I was a week clean but I relapsed. I noticed with school and all, cutting my wrist will draw attention so I messed up my thighs. I feel like this is the only escape.
-3	negative	self-harm	I was bullied all my life i think 6th grade was the worst though. I always remember being that little second grader and wondering whats wrong with me why doesnt anyone wanna be my friend? I still get picked on from time to time .
-19	negative	self-harm	I was in year 4 and my best friend died I was So sad I sat in my room crying for hours then I went to school and everyone would point and laugh. Most of the time they called me fat,ugly,wortless,stupid,messed up just because I didn't smile and laugh like they did and because I didn't like the same music as them . But it want just at school When I was out with my family people would and laugh at me because of they way I dressed. At this point I got So angry I punched my best friends in the face and gave her a black eye. I was So mad at myself for what I hadent done I stole one of my dads razor blades sat in my room and started to cute my arm. That was the first time I remember cutting. 
-1	negative	self-harm	I was told to love my body And I have scars to prove it
-14	negative	self-harm	I wear long sleeves. Mostly sweaters and jackets to hide them, my battle scars. Why do you self-harm? I do it to feel something. I am so used to being let down that i want to feel something. When you're let down you're numb right? Or is that just me? They started off small, barely drew any blood. I was scared at the beginning. I started doing it deeper. Then deeper.  I was silently screaming for help. The voices started getting stronger and louder. I felt like I didn't have control of my brain.                My depression started getting the best of me. All of my friends started turning on me, because I was changing. I tried to act happy, I really did. What happened to that sweet, little girl that always had a smile on her face? And that one that her only canvas was paper, not her body? She's hurt. She needs help.
-1	negative	self-harm	I wear my heart on my sleeve. Every cut, every time I needed to get all the pain inside of me out, it was all on my arm. I couldn't help it, it was what the heart wanted
-6	negative	self-harm	I went and visited a friend who is 5'0 and almost 300 pounds, and she was talking about food all day like it was the best thing on earth and after she ate dinner she was breathing heavy through her nose and making "mmm mmm mmm" sounds and I was repulsed, I know that is horrible. I haven't eaten in 2 days, coffee, water and smokes is what I'm surviving off of.
-15	negative	self-harm	I went to stay at a newly-renovated hotel in Jacksonville Beach, FL with a few friends for a 'girl's nite out', and as I was sitting in a chair in the room, a penny literally dropped onto the floor from the middle/bottom of my chair.  All of us were freaked out as to where it could have come fromor howor why.  And an hour later, while walking on the beach, I found a penny in a pile of seashells that had coral deposits growing on it.   And then another random penny.etc  To this day, when we all meet (2 x a yr.), we always wonder, 'what was up with the crazy pennies'.   (Sometimes when we get together we go 'ghost hunting'.  We think that the souls in the old hotel knew we were 'tuned in'.)   We were.   
-2	negative	self-harm	I wish i could start over i miss my ex i cry over her ever night even tho she has moved on and its been a year my depression slowly takes over but i dont think i can hold on i wish i could start over do everything over with her agin
-1	negative	self-harm	I wish more people knew or at least would be understanding of anxiety. I'm not just whiney. I'm not just nervous. I'm not just complaining. It is real in the physical aspect. It has a physical pain to it. It hurts. I can't stay still. And I feel like my body is being torn apart. Just because you can't see what's wrong doesn't mean nothing is there. Know that.
-5	negative	self-harm	I wrote in a blog on how I identified the person I created as P and the person that P had a relationship is N. I hope that's understandable.  And I haven't gotten an email since early this morning, and they said they wanted P. And nothing since. I really don't know what to do.
-4	negative	self-harm	Just had a panic attack. That thing hurts. It's time to make a trip to the doctor bc they are getting worst. I felt it in my chest n I began trembling
-5	negative	self-harm	Just to difficult. She is the girl I share my soul with, I saved her several times, even with my bare hands when it happened right in front of my eyes, but I accepted, knew her reasons, understood her reasons, I don't blame her at all, but I blame me for not following her, but as long as my mother is here I'm not strong enough to leave. Bo, my most beautiful journey I had with you, I felt so alive, you looked up to me, at the same time I was looking up to you, now I'm the only one who is still able to look up, I thank my life because of you, I really do, and I'll keep that promise but just like everything else, I'll have to delay it, till the time comes.
-2	negative	self-harm	Just wondering if anyone on here an help me out. I just want to feel like me again 
-1	negative	self-harm	ladies only 18 and up. just want to know how your day went
-5	negative	self-harm	Large groups of people generally annoy and drain me. It's probably why I like chatting one-on-one or in small groups. I like to feel like I know the person a little better.
-2	negative	self-harm	last night, I freaked out. I don't know why, I just had this sudden burst of emotion, of depression. and then came The Urge. that's all I guess.
-11	negative	self-harm	Last night I inflicted pain on myself for the first time. I had thought about it for a while but knew it was dangerous so I always had the self control not to, until I finally lost it. I don't know if I knew I would have no way to hide the sneak myself a knife or if I was subconsciously trying to protect myself but I grabbed a plastic knife and attempted to cut my wrists and love handles. No blood was drawn but it felt so good. I know I'll do it again, but it's so horrible and I encourage you all not to do it (I'm such a hypocrite!!!).
-3	negative	self-harm	Last night I lost it and cut myself 40 times in one session. 8 on each arm, 24 on my stomach. This isn't much of a story, but I just had to tell somebody because it was eating me alive I can't keep these secrets to myself without going crazy and cutting even more. So in a way, this has prevented me from cutting more today. Thank you  for reading about my patheticness.
-2	negative	self-harm	Last saturday i manage to cut myself with a cutter i was so depressed that i cut a litle hard until my hands bleed it was only a litle thought i never manage to hide the scars yet no one seems to notice..what do you think?
-4	negative	self-harm	Last time was back in June. I haven't since then. I just used to be so disgusted with myself. I have since moved on with my life but I now have to live with the scars
-14	negative	self-harm	Last year all the way up to summer was the best time I've ever had. It was just before things got bad at home and just before I started getting confused, suicidal, and started cutting myself. Everything was ok and I was dealing with my dad fine but after that summer ended everything went sour. My dad treated me like I wasn't worth anything and my mom didn't understand and I couldn't talk to her without it being spread to all her friends. I found out I had synesthesia then and I was so confused. All my feelings were so built up inside I felt like I was about to explode.  I want to go back to last year and start over. Relive good memories again and get to be happily naive again.
-7	negative	self-harm	Like I thought my mom found out I was cutting. Instead of talking to me, well I got an earful of screams and cuss words. Asking me "WHY??!" "WHY!??" My mom didn't talk to me for a week. She's angry. But not in the angry "I'm angry because I love you." It's in the "I'm angry because you embarrassed out family, or life."
-2	negative	self-harm	little boy: are you an angel? little boy: thank you. she is also an angel but she has already returned home.
-2	negative	self-harm	Little Boy: Are you an angel? Little Boy: Thank you. She's also an angel, but she has already returned home.
-1	negative	self-harm	Look at me and tell me what do you see? 
-4	negative	self-harm	looking in the mirror makes me cringe i hate myself to such a extent and it kills me. i feel like no one could ever like me which i believe no one does. 16 ive never been kissed or had a boyfriend, my hairs too short and im too fat for anyone to find me decent looking i cant stand myself most times i disgust myself i dont understand why i cant look like the pretty skinny girls in magazines or on tv
-5	negative	self-harm	Lost my uncle 16 years ago this January to suicide. He was such a hilarious guy. Still can't believe he's gone.  I wish I could go back in time and help him, but I can't. All we have are memories of his contagious laugh, his funny observations, and his warm personality. He was a great guy. I love you, UJ.
-1	negative	self-harm	"Made Of Scars" That's what I'm made of!!!
-2	negative	self-harm	Me and my baby went and got our marriage license yesterday ! It's almost official I'm gonna  be mrs. Johnson 
-20	negative	self-harm	Me and my brother are 4 years apart, we weren't always the best of friends but I always looked up to him.  He was a great friend, always so full of lifeI'm not sure what happend. Just days after my brothers birthday he hung himself. He had a family, a job, friends, and no signs of depression. But when my brother drank it was a different story. 08/04/13 was one of those nights, he had been drinking and celebrating is birthday. He walked to the park and hung himself by a swing. I try so hard to understand what he was going through but its so hard. This will be our first holiday with out him and I'm trying to be strong, Thanksgiving just passed and it wasnt the same it was so hard to be thankful when a huge part of my life was missing, I have a million feelings but I constantly have to stay strong because I have a family of my own who needs me. I wish you were still here big bro!! 
-2	negative	self-harm	Mind numb, body numb. That what my razor does. What does yours?
-6	negative	self-harm	More than the pain, the appearance of a wound on me (my wrist, neck, abdomen) is extremely calming. I like the look of my scars. I don't have a clear reason as to 'why'. I don't cover them. I'm not seeking attention, I think when people see the marks, they avoid me. I like the affect they have people. I've cut, scratched, bitten, and even choked myself (the one thing I wasn't fond of). I bruise myself sometimes, simply because I enjoy the look of my bruises. Is there a name for this (other than masochism)? (There's always a name for these things.) 
-7	negative	self-harm	Most of my scars are not self inflicted. I have a few that I had done myself because I was so numb from the drugs I didn't know if I was alive or not After I grew up and left my parents, I found a man he was great at first then the abuse started. Till this day I am still with and I still am beaten on for his enjoyment. I look at my body in the mirror and wonder how long will my body withstand this.. How much longer before this kills me??   
-9	negative	self-harm	most people say if you cut your stupid but in my opinion I believe they can't say that unless they have been there and done it tem selves. I have cut for a while in my life and it does help to stop the pain and the feeing tat everyone and everything hates you. I'm not saying that it is a good thing to do because it hurts you I know it helps you and it helps me but remember no matter what there are people out there that care about you. 
-7	negative	self-harm	My arms have red and pink lines all over. I don't hide them. People never asked and I don't know if they look. I cut myself to cope with the hurt of being wronged by a loved one. The last cut was the biggest and I exposed the creamy subcutaneous fat. There was hardly any pain. I felt exhilaration. The endorphins calmed me. Now I don't cut anymore. The scars are my old friends.
-2	negative	self-harm	My best friend is my sister and I love her
-2	negative	self-harm	My best friend shot herself in the chest several months ago.  I know there's no way it was my fault but I still struggle with thoughts like "Why wasn't I there?" or "Why didn't she call me?" I could have helped her, and I would have. I thought she knew that.
-2	negative	self-harm	My biggest fear was my mom finding out and having to get help and stop. Well my fear happened.. the person who told had been threatening to tell for a long time but even though I am mad about it how can you be mad at someone you need so much! I'm so scared of what lays up ahead. 
-10	negative	self-harm	My boyfriend is leaving for basic for 3 months tomorrow morning. We said our see you later and I love you's tonight before we took him to the hotel . I've never dealt with this before, I'm pretty sad to be apart for that long . Does anyone know how often they can make phone calls while he is in basic?
-3	negative	self-harm	My boyfriend recently took my blades and I've been alright I guess but I just got brand new razors and I opened them and got the blades and I don't think I can't stop myself from cutting
-6	negative	self-harm	My brotherI love you and hate you with equal measure. It will be a year since you decided to leave us and each day we get closer to the anniversary it scares me. My insides are such a mess. I can cry for days from how much I miss you and scream at you for the pain you put so many throughWhy didn't you let me help you? Everyday it feels like a piece of my heart is missingbut that's okit was your part to take.
-3	negative	self-harm	My brother is such an ungrateful and lazy person. He expects things from my parents and other people - he's 31 years old - and then acts like he's got it so bad, "poor me". It's like he expects things to be handed to him without doing any work. I'm sick of his attitude.
-12	negative	self-harm	My brother lives with my mom. He's in his 30's and she is in her early 60's. They are both alcoholics, but she works full time. He has never held down a job, steals from her, and is abusive in many ways. She has tried to get him out of the house for at least a couple of years, but he always manipulates his way back. I believe he is a sociopath or at very least a narcissist.  Anyone else deal with a similar situation? Did you help resolve it? What did you do to help? Or what did you do that you now regret doing?
-1	negative	self-harm	My cat, the Dude recently passed away. He was a orange calico.  
-1	negative	self-harm	My cuts are burning but that's ok. I can feel again 
-3	negative	self-harm	My dad committed suicide 18 yrs ago when I was 5. I remember him taking me to the park and that we had fun but I still feel really angry and abandoned. Because of my subsided aching due to his absence, I've craved love since middle school and found myself in an emotionally and a mild physically abusive relationship. Thankfully, I'm not as sad as I used to be but I hate that I'm still blaming someone who can never answer to me.
-5	negative	self-harm	my dad got mad at my little sister (who is my everything). he is violent and kicked her in the head (he isnt hurt now) and screamed at her, my mom and me. i am scared and my anger is building and im also very depressed . i really want to cut. i hadnt cut for a good 9 months until last week when my girlfriend cheated on me. 
-9	negative	self-harm	My dad passed away 11 years ago when I was only 9 years old.  At weird times when I'm either thinking about him or stressed out I'll find pennies in the strangest places.  This morning on the way to take my GRE test for graduate school, I said some prayers and asked my dad to help me have confidence in myself during the test. At the testing center, they give you a locker to put your belongings in. Upon opening mine, I found a penny heads up right in the door of the locker.  Unlike my mother, I have always been skeptical about "pennies from heaven". But this morning after finding my penny from my dad, I found confidence in myself for my test just as I asked him and confidence in the pennies I find truly being from heaven.    
-18	negative	self-harm	My dad was such a great man. There was not one day in my life where he had not made me laugh. With anything he did. He'd be cooking and singing at the top of his lungs, or even dancing! The only bad trait was his drinking. But other than that, he was my best friend. We got along better than anyone I knew, and I was around him all the time. I went with him for walks to the store, whether it be across the street or across the city. We worked together delivering Chinese food for a while, and that was the greatest! My dad would talk to my friends as if he'd known them for years. He'd go on and on to my one friend about being in the marines. He'd threaten any guy to break my heart or make me cry. He really was the guy to depend on. I knew he'd help me if I ever needed it, and he knew I'd do the same Rest In Piece daddy! Love you and miss you tons./;
-1	negative	self-harm	My daughter committed suicide on Oct 3rd 2012.  I miss her so much.  I am so very alone and sad all the time.
-4	negative	self-harm	My daughters dad passed on when she was 14 months old. It's been years and she is now losing teeth. We put it under her pillow . I played tooth fairy and put four quarters under her pillow.  She walked into the living room this morning with four quarters and a penny  I did not put the penny there.  
-2	negative	self-harm	My depression is self diagnosed, but I don't think it makes a difference. Every day I fear the moment I lose control over myself, something that is  closer every time I wake up. I'm with cat.
-3	negative	self-harm	My depression led to my cutting problem. It started very early though I did not acknowledge it until recently. Funny how cutting was originally to get me out of my depression but now it's bringing me back into it.
-21	negative	self-harm	My friend commited suicide. But, I might have been the last person to talk to him. He was confessing that he was very attracted to me, and he wanted to take me to lunch in the days to follow. I told him I was busy, and I wasn't sure if I could. Then he said if I didn't want to, to just say so. And all I told him was, "I'm busy. I don't know if I can." I didn't hear from him the next day. Or the day after that. I did however, hear that he killed himself. All I can think is, what if I had said, "Sure, let's go to Five Guys. I love burgers." Maybe he would have waited a couple days. Even just one. And maybe he would have saw that life isn't all that bad. Then we would have gone to lunch, and had a great time, and he would have been alive. And I wouldn't have had to watch his father cry on his casket at the funeral and wonder what I'm going to say to them after the service.
-2	negative	self-harm	My friend goes to me if you were really suicidal you would have killed yourself already.   can't some save me
-10	negative	self-harm	my friend move away to a different continent because her dad retired from the military and I guess there family lives there, but it was only once she was gone did I realize how much I truly love her. granted I was like 10 or 11 at the time but I can't stop thinking about her ever. I am 15 years old now and I have never been able to love someone else like how I loved her. I am just so lonely and probably will always be:/
-1	negative	self-harm	My friend's brother committed suicide summer of his sophomore year. His family has never been the same
-21	negative	self-harm	My friends joke about suicide nearly everyday. They have no idea what goes on in my head. How many times I've tried to end it. They don't see the scars that run up my wrist, I smile, to keep them smiling. The one friend I had the guts to tell, told people. It eventually died down when I laughed it off and made them all stop believing what they don't hear from the person they're laughing at. I come home, I cry, I go back down and pretend nothing's wrong. I want them to believe that suicide is no joke. It takes a lot for mental pain to turn into physical pain. Let alone letting the physical pain effect you mentally again, no one deserves the feeling that they're not good enough, because they are. So are you. Just believe in yourself.
-25	negative	self-harm	My friend tried killing himself one time and never got help. He is lucky to be alive. Well yesterday i am in second hour and he texts me; "now" so i respond "what" he said "i need you, come to your car" once i asked if he was ok he said no. And i was freaking out and asked to go to the nurse and then i just left and went to my car and apparently he took more pills and tried again before school. I had a feeling something was up when i picked him up for school. But i ditched and talked to him and he wouldn't fully open up with me. And i was shaking and crying i just want to help him. He knows I'm the only one he can relate to, yet he still only wanted to talk to his cousin which is actually kind of rude to him. But i hate when i ask if he is ok and he just acts like nothing happened. He tried to kill himself, that's not nothing. I wish i could help him.
-9	negative	self-harm	My grandfather shot himself in the head, many years later my first cousin died on the tracks in front of our house, 5 years after that my husband hung him self, then another cousin, over dosed on his meds, he was an RN, then my first cousins son was found hanging after his parents threatened to divorce. I was suicidal for many years, I suffer with post traumatic stress disorder, but I have clung to hope with all I have,  Im lacking in faith terribly, and am no longer on medication.  I have not been suicidal for several years now, life is better, but I still go through bouts of intense fear and nightmares.
-19	negative	self-harm	My grandmother raised me and was my best friend. She died about 15 years ago. I can't remember when the pennies started showing up but I have been finding them in the strangest places and I know she is sending me encouragement and love.  I am a caregiver and work for an agency, going into seniors homes and caring for them.  Yesterday I found a penny under a burner cover on a stove top in one of my clients homes. Another time I was cleaning out the ashes in my wood stove and found one in the ashes.  The strangest place I found one was in a clients incontinent system when I was  getting a client ready for bed.  I feel very close to Mum when I find one because I know it is her who is leaving them for me and it made me smile , she always had a sense of humor.  I love you Mum and can hardly wait until we are reunited in heaven but until then please keep the pennies coming.  They really brighten my day.
-19	negative	self-harm	My habit began early on in middle school. I had accidentally cut myself at first, just one of those freak accidents. It took my emotional pain away I was able to focus on hiding the accidental cut so that no one would think I did it on purpose. It went unnoticed. I figured that I could get an emotional release and get away with it, so I started my habit. The cuts and scars were growing on my left arm until my parents finally noticed. My father told me I was stupid and that I was just copying off of someone else. The sad part is that I was the one who had influenced my own friend. I betrayed her by anonymously notifying the counselors of her habit; I didn't want her to go down the road I was already on. How do I ask for help? I need someone. 
-4	negative	self-harm	My heart is broken because I had to let him go I didn't want to hurt him. I knew I have 6 more days left and really don't want to hurt the people I love. It's so close. 
-11	negative	self-harm	My mom and two of my siblings are borderline. None of them are willing to get help for it. And they feed off from each other on a daily basis. Unfortunately I am disabled and very dependent on them for help day to day. I try to find ways to separate myself from them (activities outside of the home) but because of my condition, I can no longer drive very often on my own so it is pointless to have my own car. My mom is very manipulative about allowing me to use hers. Things like this (as I am sure anyone here can contest) is what just adds to my daily stress of having to deal with them. The thing is they all act like they don't even seem to care that I am very sick and the way they act is making me worse. I don't know what to do. I've tried going to therapy, reading books. I think the only way I am going to get away from them is if I get into a relationship but its hard enough to date when you aren't sick
-2	negative	self-harm	My mom compares me to my cousin who is really smart and it got so bad that I burned myself I have the scar still I was 10 and I'm 16 now. I still burn myself from time to time.
-11	negative	self-harm	My mom has tried committing suicide three times in the past three years. Her mother, my grandmother, committed suicide four years ago. It's been a rough four years. I miss my mom and who she was before we lost my grandmother to suicide. My mother was very close with my grandmother, which explains why my mom's grieving has been so difficult. I'm afraid to get close to my mom. She's been strange to me since my grandmother's passing and I've purposely distanced myself now that my dad has told me about her suicide attempts that occurred while I was away at college. I make it a point to call my mom often but I am still dealing with the disappoint. I want to tell her that I love her and to stay strong. I don't know how to stay strong and be there for her too. 
-3	negative	self-harm	My mom thinks it is ok that I put my self out there. Literally. And she calls me fat. Then she wonders why I'm depressed.
-10	negative	self-harm	My mother and I had a huge fight, and I know it was my fault, but I also apologized the second after that. but then she said that 'I am dead for her and she is dead for me from now onwards' and she wishes that no on ever gets a daughter like me.. I have been crying since days, even if she is angry how can she say that to her own daughter. I worship her like my God, and there is no one i love more than her.. and now she is'nt talking to me at all. she say she never wants to. My father is already dead and now i feel i don't have a mother also . 
-8	negative	self-harm	My mother just passed away on Sept. 24, 2013.  The whole day I was surrounded by butterflies.  The next day I was going about my day taking care of the funeral plans and I had seen so many pennies every where I was.  I have always known about "Pennies from Heaven".  To me by seeing and picking up all these pennies my mother was telling me that she has made it to heaven.  Thank you Mom, I miss u a lot.
-3	negative	self-harm	My mother passed on 08/14/13 this past Wednesday . This morning as I was walking up the steps to my office I found a penny on heads..  who knew that a penny could bring so much joy! 
-4	negative	self-harm	My mother took her life. She took mine with her. I will never be complete again. A tear still falls everyday when I think of her.
-9	negative	self-harm	my only regret is I didn't extinguish myself 2 years agoand for that, i'm still here.don't know why i didn't,.they lied..things didn't get better, only worse. I let go of drinking and smoking long ago, no longer find any enjoyment in things that only relieved symptoms of withdrawal ..each day is bleaker than the one that already passed by, and only half as bleak as the one approaching. told EVERYONE that it's not a matter of if, but when.no one believes me or cares to discuss it.only well meaning therapists who could care less. Everything only serves as a reminder of my inadequacy..never good enough.only a placeholder till someone better comes along.
-4	negative	self-harm	My past is awful. This means that my future can only be better! This makes me excited for what is to come. 
-6	negative	self-harm	My scars are not fading away. Living with anxiety and depression isn't at all what I want, I lost everything. There's a story behind my self harm but I don't know if I'm ready to tell it just yet, but it began out of curiously. I miss what my life used to be like and who I used to have. It's becoming painful to wake up.
-6	negative	self-harm	My sister moved hours away from me and took her baby that I helped raise with her. She rarely visits and lets her two- year old run a muck when she does visit. I have to rely on my patience to keep my spirits appropriate for my nena. And when she does visit it is short! My car is a junker so it is impossible to make the trip up the mountain to see her. My heart is broken.
-8	negative	self-harm	My sister took her life. I have lost loved ones before. It's is sad. But, This is so different. Yes, I feel sadness, loss, pain, devastation. But this loss also causes anger, frustration, confusion, guilt emotions that aren't normally associated with losing someone. I'll never be whole again. I'll never understand why. I'll never heal from this. She thought she found a way to end her pain. All she really did was transfer it to those of us she left behind and then multiplied it. I miss her. I want an undo button so badly. So much emotion nowhere to shelve it. My life is forever changed. A hole forever in my soul. A shattered heart with missing pieces. And I have no choice or say. It just is. And it's too late. I'm broken.
-11	negative	self-harm	My son is 4 years old. He has difficulty listening. I tell him over and over and try different ways of saying it to make it fun, but it's a constant job. He needs constant attention it seems and I have a two year old that is very calm, able to self entertain ect. They ate polar opposites. my four year old gets very hyper at night right before bed and needs melatonin to go to sleep. We have tried everything to get him to sleep without medication. It takes him hours. Do with the doctors approval we give him a small dose. He had a very difficult time having down time or playing by himself. He's very loud. I understand that these behaviors are normal for a four year old. But it's constant for him. It's getting to a point that my patience run very thin and I have to use the mommy voice. He feels i'm being mean and hurtful. I just don't know what to do. Does he have sound like your children with adhd? Advice on what the first signs were and what you did?
-2	negative	self-harm	My wrist looks ugly again! Ffs I just can't continue leaving this way 
-1	negative	self-harm	need to be on my own a lot at times. I cant stand the party girls. the loud awful music of my generation. some people say im an old soul. partys i find, are crap, especially house partys. always the group of girls wanting the attention of 50 different guys in there lives, and guys need to show off how much of a man they are. i see it all the time. im 22 now , ive just gotten tired of it, people acting like fools when drunk, people getting sick. even just doing other things that does not involve partying like going off with so many other people for concerts can be tiring. i need to do my thing to feel happy. its who i am.  i cant change that. 
-1	negative	self-harm	Never giving myself a chance; never believing in myself; usually scared. I want so bad to get out of this mentality and one new year resolution is going to be to do so.
-1	negative	self-harm	Next month is my sweet sixteen and everyone I know is coming to my party , I need to lose 20 ibs in one month to fit my dress , I need someone that'll push+ motivate me to achieve my goal .
-8	negative	self-harm	Nine years ago when I performed in my first stage performance that led me into the life of community theater, I put several objects consisted of photos, copies of the program, a t-shirt, etc. Here it is, nine years later, I have several boxes that are overflowing with many programs, props, and other things relating to my community theater career.
-5	negative	self-harm	No it hasn't always been like this, its not all the time. It's so hard to explain, but I will try. Nobody notices, nobody cares, they don't even ask. It is one the hardest thing to get but nobody is helping. Nobody is listening to my silent cries for help.
-1	negative	self-harm	No matter what people say, I always .
-6	negative	self-harm	No one knows the struggle. No one knows how alone I am. No one knows how bad.. I want to cut. They look at the scars. They are so curious. If only they actually cared. Can someone stay and help me through this for once? No. They never can.
-4	negative	self-harm	Not a day goes by that I don't deprive myself of what my body truly wants. I'm sick, I know. I want food, but I refuse to let myself have it. I just flush myself with water. If only I could achieve and maintain pure perfection. A body that makes me happy. 
-6	negative	self-harm	Oh my god,  I'm about to break, I just can't. I've already started to hyperventilate! I just need to cut. I have the razor right beside me, I really need help, right now. It's just over 2 months since a last cut, but I really can't, she's pushed me far, not too far but far. I can Bradley breath right now. I've locked my self in the closet and I just want to spend the whole night there. Please give me a reason not to cut, I feel like my heart is about to explode.
-3	negative	self-harm	Okay so, I have done it again. It's been over a year since I have. But I couldn't cope anymore. Help.
-9	negative	self-harm	Ok so if you've read my I battle depression story you would know I cut myself. I'm going to go further into about that experience. I have attempted suicide 42 time in the past 5 years. It's to complicated to explain in one story but throughout my stories you will see more of my past and piece by piece you will begin to understand me. I'm here and alive surprisingly, I guess God has a plan for me 
-5	negative	self-harm	Ok so I'm officially a week in! I weighed myself today and I'm 9 st 3lbs  Goodnight everyone..
-3	negative	self-harm	Once you start it's so difficult to stop. It's addictive, the chemicals that release from your brain are addictive. The pain is addictive. That's why now 4 years down the line, I still self harm. All it takes is a picture of cuts or scars, then I get this urge to do it again. Even though I hate my legs, they are covered in scars. I still add more to that collection. People who haven't done it don't understand, the urges, the triggering photos all over the Internet. It's not like I want to do it, but I NEED to do it.
-3	negative	self-harm	One cut I know it will be coming out in a few more days.
-2	negative	self-harm	One day, you will feel like a loser. Not any type of loser, but the one who lost it all. Maybe I am still that loser- that failure. But I just dont want to be the failure, loser AND quitter. Two is enough.
-17	negative	self-harm	On the 12th of December last night my best friend's brother committed suicide in his room. His mom found him dead in his room I do not know what made him think he didn't want to go on. I do not know what he use to kill himself. When the teacher told the whole school I broke down crying.I didn't care. All it meant to me was he was goneI wouldn't see home ever again. My best friend and her family won't ever see him again. My best friend always looked up to her older brothers. My best friend's brother was so kind. He would play with me and my sister,we laughed,we made jokes,we were happy. The last time I saw him was when he was picking up his brother and his sister (sister- best friend). I will miss him so much. He seemed so happyI will always remember him in my heart. But the best thing was that he loved The Lord with all his heart. And now we have another angel.               You'll always be in my heart
-4	negative	self-harm	On the 23rd of December 2011 at 7.15 am I found my mother/soulmate dead she had committed suicide. I jjust  cannot accept it believe or  ever gonna get over this im engulfed in grief that actually gets worse with time But worst of all she has broken my son's heart!!! 
-7	negative	self-harm	On the computer, it's a lot different, but in real life speaking to another person is so difficult that I just don't even try, really. I'll never initiate a conversation with someone I feel is a stranger. They talk first or it's just going to be awkward silence from there on. And even when they talk, I just don't say much. I have a tendency to stumble over my words and not have the ability to clearly think as I speak and I'm one of those blushers that has their whole face light up like a Christmas light so I just stare at the table the entire time. I've been ridiculed by my family on occasion for my fairly anti-social behavior. I get the feeling they just tease and don't seriously mean it, but for them to laugh at me for my fears hurts. I'm afraid of messing up a conversation, for being too afraid to carry it out, for being worried they'll reject me for a lot of reasons.
-9	negative	self-harm	On the days when I'm feeling great, I feel so blessed to be an infj. I know that being an infj is a blessing despite the roller coaster of emotions experienced, but sometimes I just get tired of dealing with myself once "burnout" (as one poster put it) hits. Burnout feels so horrible  Do other infj's feel that way? Do you feel tired of the major ups and downs? Feel tired of being on the Mt. Everest of Joy and Success and then in while in the Marianas Trench of disconnectedness and hopelessness? Yes, I know there are a lot of different things here. My mind is pinging and a lot of stuff stressing me out. 
-6	negative	self-harm	Or directly after high school really. Maybe we weren't soul mates or destined to get married. But I loved that boy. We had been seeing each other for a while, it was exclusive.  I don't obsess over it any more but he still crosses my mind often. Reminds you that there's an emptiness in you that you forgot you had. Some days you just miss him more.
-4	negative	self-harm	Pain comforts a broken heart. I always let the tears fall as I feel my heart tear apart. It's a reminder that I am still alive.. Feeling broken becomes apart of you. It becomes so common that you forget that it's there. Id rather look like everything is together, than to look like I am dying slowly.
-2	negative	self-harm	Pain lets me know im still alive .
-1	negative	self-harm	Pain, without love That you'll thank me late
-2	negative	self-harm	People ask me, why did you cut yourself? Doesn't it hurt? 
-3	negative	self-harm	People say cutting is for attention but they don't know anyone's story. I've been through a lot n having a rough time. I just wish anyone could understand how I feel because I try n tell my family but they won't every get it
-3	negative	self-harm	People that don't understand the feeling of self harm think it's 'disgusting' but they don't know how you really feel. Wanna know what it feels like? It's relief, relief from how you feel, takes your mind off things, it makes me feel human again. It's so wrong but it feels so right. It's a mental addiction. If anyone needs someone too talk to about self harm, message me, remember you're not alone. Stay strong!
-5	negative	self-harm	People who see self harm as attention seeking could honestly not be more wrong. If it's seeking for attention why do we try so hard to hide it? Self harm doesn't kill, self harm only makes us a stronger person at the end of the day, we are still here fighting.
-1	negative	self-harm	Put your hands up if you are a victim of self sabotage!  I can't believe the things I put myself through and the worst part of the whole stupid ordeal is that i don't even know why, or sometimes even how, I ruin things for myself.  If I knew why I act the way i do then perhaps I could pull some reverse psychology on myself and try to condition my behavior towards how I would like to be. I can present myself in over twenty or so different personalities, allowing certain people to see certain traits so that they will love me, trust me, and all that good stuff, but I can't bring myself to reflect their emotions regarding me.  My head won't let my heart be free and this inner war is going to tear me apart, I fear.
-4	negative	self-harm	RIP to my friend Yoko. May she be in all of our prayers tonight. It was Yoko's time, and anyone's can come at anytime. 
-4	negative	self-harm	Seems so simple but yet so hard to do I still dont know what she was thinkingWhy would she????How could she????
-7	negative	self-harm	Self harming for me is like getting high. I've never been addicted to it but I've gone back and forth since I was a teenager. Last time I did it was 6 months ago and before that it had been many many years. I fight the urge every day now. 
-1	negative	self-harm	She had cancer and we didn't want her suffering, so we had to put her down.
-4	negative	self-harm	She paints a lovely picture, with a shocking twist.  The paintbrush is a razor and the canvas is her wrist.
-2	negative	self-harm	She paints a pretty picture, And her heart was her wrist.
-6	negative	self-harm	She was depressed for so long but when I was a kid I never understood, and when she had to go to the hospital I thought she was just sick. She died almost a year ago and I was the first one to find her. The trauma from that day I will live with forever.
-9	negative	self-harm	since 4 years old I wondered why I was over weight and everyone was skinny around me, at 8 I began baking muffins and cookies and ate all of them. I was disappointed in myself so I started starving myself and self harming at 11 years old I always help people get through their problems but no one helps me, people need to know they're beautiful and worthy of life, if you haven't self harmed or starved yourself before then good because it honestly ruins your life
-2	negative	self-harm	Since about six weeks I suffer from what is seen as (adult) c-ptsd. I did reach out for professional help but in my country (as elsewhere I guess) it is not so easy to find help or treatment. I seems I am through the period of flashbacks. Still I am loaded with the pain that came from that. Quite desperate at the moment.
-5	negative	self-harm	So about 6 months ago my 13 year old daughter gave me a letter. She was in tears and said read this! She is in counseling and meds for depression so I hope with time her urge to hurt herself to mask the other pains will subside and some day be no more!
-5	negative	self-harm	So around two days ago I carved words into my skin for the first time in a long time. I know have alone and failure on my left thigh. The whole thing triggered me into wanting more. I know I should be stopping, kind of want to, but I just can't. I just can't.
-12	negative	self-harm	So, can anyone give me advice? So i downloaded this 12 days of gifts from the apple store. So, I love minions and one of the gifts was a minion movie and I wanted it bad. But it was for the different country not the one i'm connected too and so I asked my mom if I could make another itunes account for that country and get the movie for free and I know we are on a budget so I was trying to be considerate at the same time and I was also gonna do the whole thing myself and I just needed her approval or permission but she said. "Omigosh, its too much work. Why do you need it anyway? No. You cant mess with it because something is gonna go wrong and I'm probably gonna have to fix it and i just don't have time. Why can't you just leave it alone? Ughhh..
-2	negative	self-harm	So here I go again I would love to have fasting buddy to share with this all.
-2	negative	self-harm	So here I go again I would love to have fasting buddy to share with this all.
-3	negative	self-harm	So I am currently 160 In august I was 178. I'm just going to keep updating this post with my progress.I plan on fasting next week. &lt;3 wish me luck lovlies 
-5	negative	self-harm	So i cut for about a year after being bullied at my old school, and it started up again this year at my new one because of the stress of the workloadbut then my parents found out and i had to stop. Recently i discovered burning which heals so much faster and i'm hookedits kind of scary thoughim trying to stop but its so addictive.
-7	negative	self-harm	so, I cut myself but lately it's gotten so bad that I cant go a day without it, my parents found out 2 months ago and want me to stop but I just can'ti'm not even sure if I want to any more, I want to be happier but I don't want to stop, it's like im alone and that's the only thing that consoles me when i'm upset. 2 weeks ago I get really upset and instead of cutting my thigh or hip, I cut my wrist, it wasn't deep, it only bled for a few minutes but it felt better. since then I've been doing it on my wrist more, but only so much that I can cover it with a watch but it's so hard to cover it at school as my watch slips down sometimesI don't know what to do, I feel like i'm drowning so much deeper than before and it's impossible to get better  how does everybody stop? it seems impossible :'(
-3	negative	self-harm	So I hadn't cut myself for 6 weeks until just now I HAD to, I had to feel the blade on my wrist..but it's deep and wide, and I feel sleepy now, I guess I'm going back to it :/
-11	negative	self-harm	So I have had major changes in my life this year. I graduated from college and moved back home. I'm working at a job I hate and living with my crazy family to save money. I want go to graduate school. The thing I have realized after being home for a while is that I'm lonely.  Maybe no one will understand this, or maybe all of you will think I'm being a baby. I thought by writing down some of my worries it would help me and maybe someone out there would understand too.
-12	negative	self-harm	So I'm just going to start from the middle, I don't know if I have a beginning and I still haven't found ending. This is going to act as a diary, except other people can read it, I guess that defeats the purpose of diary but I think the anonymity of it, is like hiding a notebook under a pillow or in the bottom of a drawer, blanket of security that no one can see through. "Oh these tangled webs we weave"
-1	negative	self-harm	So im like 13 now and everyone says i self harm i dont think i do Thankyou
-17	negative	self-harm	So I'm some what proud to say I haven't cut myself in a few weeks I had a much longer clean streak before the summer though, I didn't cut for a year and a half but then summer came and I found I had to much time on my hand to think. And me with time to think equals thinking about all the things wrong with me Which leads to my cutting. All summer I found myself wishing I was back a school so I would have that distraction once again. Now that I'm back I'm once again happy. I will stay at my school longer than needed because I find myself happier there than I am at home. I crave the busyness that high school provides. And if there isn't any I will actually ask for more homework Crazy huh? But anyway I still haven't cut for about 3 weeks and I hope to try to beat my record last time because I want to get better and I want to make my two favorite teachers proud and not disappoint them by cutting myself again. I want to get better and I'm trying to get better. Sometimes it's just hard.
-3	negative	self-harm	So I plan on stopping for good now. I don't know how well this will work because I've tried it before, and it didn't work well since it only lasted not even 6 months. But I asked my friend if he would help me stop, because he's told me that I'm better than this and it's nothing but a terrible addiction, and that I won't need to do this anymore. It's put me in a better mood since last night. After school today, I plan on giving him the two pieces of metal I have with me today. I hope I can overcome it this time. :/
-7	negative	self-harm	So it had been a while but then I went out with my boyfriend, my best friend and her date. None of them know that I used to cut or how depressed I can get, wish I could tell them but my life is kind of complicated even with my closest friends.  I'm meant to be staying with my boyfriend tomorrow night but I'm scared about what he will say when he sees the scars. 
-4	negative	self-harm	So, I used to self harm.  My immediate family knew but no one else. Lately, I have been getting the same feelings that I used to and turned back to self harm. I just want to be able to talk to someone who won't judge me.
-3	negative	self-harm	So I've had an awful day i just want to cry and cry and I'm staring at this glass and I just want to pick it up.. But I don't want to relapse. :'(
-4	negative	self-harm	So, just join the club and find out a lot of people thinking they are "sociopath". You dont know what a sociopath is like, people! We are as close as being a politician as being a killer. So dont pretend like you have this sickness and underestimate it, just dont!
-1	negative	self-harm	so many I lost count,and not just physical scars and cuts:/
-1	negative	self-harm	So many sides I don't even know who I am? How are you supposed to find that out?
-4	negative	self-harm	Some days it's quiet, it's dormant inside me and I might forget that it's there. Most days I feel it growing, and then when it's ready it bursts inside me and I'm unable to get out of bed, pick up the phone, make myself a meal Wishing everyone, myself included, strength today and everyday
-1	negative	self-harm	Some days more than others. Today especially. I already have. I definitely need stitches But that's not happening. Still wasn't enough.
-2	negative	self-harm	Someone you married and dearly love and you discover cheated on you some 20 years ago, and is still in contact with this person. What would you do??
-8	negative	self-harm	Some people make fun of others because they cut them selves. Everyone has a different reason, some people just love the feel of cold steel cutting through their own flesh. My worst scar is on my chest. I didn't stab myself or anything but it was from a heart surgery and heart transplant. I found it to be so disgusting i could never look at myself in the mirror, pretty soon i started to stab my arms with with my jagged sharp objects. Kinda felt good in a weird way.   
-2	negative	self-harm	Sometimes I don't like the way I am. Sometimes I wish I had a different life. But, oh well :/
-11	negative	self-harm	Sometimes I feel as though it isn't a legit reason that I self harm occasionally because I'm EXTREMELY insecure about myself. Than I realize I'm not alone. The only thing I'm really scared if is I might be blowing this out if proportion( that's what my friends and family would say). But u don't think that I am.  The other tunes I've don't it they were like scratches so no one would see the. And find out but for the first time I think they might end up as scars and not go away. I feel like I'm getting worse the more I think about things and I also get more insecure which cause me to bully and beat myself up even more.
-6	negative	self-harm	Sometimes I think I spend more of my time in flashbacks than in actual present life.  I find it so hard to stay in the present and I'm always so scared.  I no longer believe in safety- it's a nice thought, but it doesn't exist and it never did.  I have a "startle reflex" my therapist calls it, that's pretty bad.  It's the fear I find so hard to live with, the fear from the past that I can't seem to get over in the present.  I haven't known about my diagnosis for long, a few months, I was in a really good hospital trauma unit for four months, but now I'm out and feel worse and worry I'll never be able to function normally again.
-2	negative	self-harm	Sometimes you just cant handle it anymore nothing feels right and nothing feels wrong too Its like with every cut the pain goes away a little.
-3	negative	self-harm	So much going on around me.. I feel like I'm slowly losing my mind. It's all been harder since i threw out the razor blade.. But the scissors are still under my bed incase.   I need help.
-1	negative	self-harm	So the teacher I talk about in my other stories has a lot to do with my self harm situation.  
-5	negative	self-harm	So this is hard to say. 4 years ago my parents started fighting and now they blame it on me. I try to let it go but it's so hard. Now I'm getting bullied in school. And I cut myself to deal with my feelings. I just want someone to talk
-5	negative	self-harm	So today, I'm giving up my blades. I'm going to my friends house for a cut check, and I'm giving them to him for good. No more taking apart pencil sharpeners, just no blades in general. It is the official day that I'm giving all of this up.
-6	negative	self-harm	So yeah I think Im borderline psycho. I have different personalities. They have names. They like different kinds of food and stuff. I dont know if I really do have multiple perosnalities or its just my excuse for my lack of ability in decision making lol.
-10	negative	self-harm	STOP WHILE YOU CAN!! I cut myself.. but I'm not the emo type and I don't tell anyone about it but when I do I think its seriously annoying that they think I'm doing as a trend. I don't do it all the time..only when I'm angry. I'm glad to say I don't do it much anymore. I'm trying my best to control myself. The deepest cut I made on purpose was when my gf broke up with around august last year. I was so shocked I couldn't cry and the feeling wouldn't go away so I did what I thought I should do I made a cut on my wrist so deep I could see my vein and took the blade out as soon as I noticed it. What was weird is I didn't feel any physical pain and I'm thankful I saw it in time otherwise I wouldn't have stopped. Now I have a scar half way through my wrist and I regret it. I'm reminded of my mistakes every time I look down my hands. So I'm pleading to those people that are just starting to cutborvhave thought of it, stop now because its a lot harder to quit than you think. 
-3	negative	self-harm	Stress was building up, It was like my drug.
-1	negative	self-harm	Thank you guys for the support!!! 
-1	negative	self-harm	The bruises on her skin,tell the storyof how mentaught herrightfrom wrong
-1	negative	self-harm	The emotions I have keep building up and they won't stop building I need something to make me stop feeling the pain the sadness the loss will anything ever help me cutting only helps for a while then I regret but I keep doing it nothing will ever help me I've lost all the hope I had.
-5	negative	self-harm	The feeling of cutting yourself is a different kind of pain, it makes me feel human again. Every bad thing that happens in my life the only way I think I can resolve it is by cutting.
-4	negative	self-harm	The first time I heard of this was reading peoples posts on here. And reading them makes me feel that there's a good chance I have the same thing!!
-6	negative	self-harm	The first time I (kinda) self harmed was when I was about five, I scratched the sides of my mouth, to make scabs.  I just feel like whenever something bad happens, it's my fault and I should take it out on myself. I use scissors, knives, paper and my fingernails. I use anything I can get my hands on.
-1	negative	self-harm	Their names were Alice and Bella. I I can't even begin to describe the hurt its like beyond emotional feeling words I cried for days when I heard Alice was dead and I have nightmares about her I miss her and Bella too
-1	negative	self-harm	The last time I cut was two weeks ago I needed stitches but I didn't get them for fear of being sent back to a mental hospital again I want to relapse so badly I miss the blade is that bad I don't know anymore I just want to be done but I can't give up
-2	negative	self-harm	There are currently over 110,00 people waiting for an organ donation. The largest group waiting is from 18-49 years of age. An average of 18 people die each day while on the waiting list for an organ donation. Organs and tissues from a single non-living donor can be used to benefit more than 50 people. Living donors can donate a kidney and parts of their liver, lung, pancreas, or intestine. Living donors can be evaluated to help a friend, family member or even donate anonymously to patients on the wait list. I am overwhelmed with pride - and my miracle boy keeps on giving. 26 lives, and counting.
-5	negative	self-harm	There are ten deep, jagged scars that run the length of my left forearm that have been there for the past three years. I've just been counting down the days until they'd go away but they don't. Applying copious amounts of foundation on them to go to prom, wearing long sleeve sweaters in the Californian summertime, and skipping out on beach invitations. The first cuts, cat scratches in middle school. But as things got worse the cuts in high school covered the whole length of my arm. And when that wasn't enough my methods changed to the depth, until I'd have to wear gauze pads and change them by the hour since my cuts would bleed for days until I was forced to get stitch tape on it. These scars tell a story but one I'm always too afraid to share with people. I don't want to let them define me but I'm too self-conscious even though I don't self-harm anymore to ever let them be seen. 
-3	negative	self-harm	The story they tell is just of how ugly and worthless i am.
-7	negative	self-harm	The sudden light was blinding for a second. Everything was so loud, soon my eyes adjusted and I felt the cold shap blade against my hand, squeezing it with anger. one swift, quick cut and I could feel something besides from this emotional pain.  It was over, the thrill was amazing, I was shaking, I felt human. Xx
-1	negative	self-harm	Thinking it's my fault when something goes awry even if it is not or I just don't know. I am trying to build up my self-esteem in order to get out of this habit.
-1	negative	self-harm	This INFP thing describes me perfectly. It's pretty awesome
-4	negative	self-harm	This is a poem I wrote about my partner and soul mate. It has now been just over four years since I lost Leigh to suicide. Thank-you for taking the time to read my poem.
-7	negative	self-harm	This is my story of recovery guys check it out. To be in DBT you have to believe that all things are possible and that hope is very much a thing of fact not fiction, even if its just a little bit to start with.  I go by this saying now I don't need any aspect of my recovery to be easy, just need it to be possible.  If this was easy we would have it all figured out by now.  But if I believe that there is hope in recovery, especially my own then it can be as easy or as hard as it wants, it just doesnt matter.  I truly believe in this and it can be applied to DBT or life in generalIf you believe in something then you stand and you fight for it and you fight on the front line.  You dont quit because it becomes hard, uncomfortable, and most of all 
-4	negative	self-harm	This is SO me!!!!! I am my own worst enemy. I am so unconfident and always see the worst in most situations. I have alopecia and i cant come to terms with it. I feel as if my life is over, and that nobody will love me or want to be with me. I imagine being on my own forever or having artificial insemination to have children. I cry alot and easily get upset. I pushed my ex bf away coz of my insecurities caused by alopecia
-6	negative	self-harm	This just happened and I really feel the need to get it out. A few minutes ago, I was cutting my arms, and bleeding thoroughly. I was so upset (I still am) and I am so unbelievably ashamed. I was cutting over and over, and blood was running down my arms. It just felt sonecessary! I hate myself for this. 
-3	negative	self-harm	This month would have marked the 2 month that I has not self harmed. But sadly it doesn't since I could not take the pressure of my family's constant insults over Christmas Eve dinner. It was to much for me to handle and later that night, with out even realizing I cut.  I'm disappointed in myself, I tried to be strong but I believe I never will be..
-5	negative	self-harm	This one is for you, and it's deeper than the rest, and it's okay, because its only for attention That's why I sit in the back of the class, don't go to lunch, and never speak?" That's why I cut where people can't normally see, because all I want is attention but when you told me we couldn't wear shorts on swimming day for gym and pulled down my shorts yourself, you saw the puffy red lines. This is what you told everyone, when all of them could see "Wow, attention seeker, much?" The school called my mom, and told her everything This one's for you, b*tch.
-7	negative	self-harm	Those few words. They hit hard, like when you would get hit with a ball to the head playing dodge ball in primary school, and the worst part, they come at the time you least expect and from the ones you didn't ever think would say it. People say that they are just words, but words are more powerful then a lot of people think. I have a scar on my body for every single hurtful word anyone has ever said to me. People don't understand it; what they say can hurt. The one person you didn't think would ever turn against you seems to be the only one who does. It's as if everyone who you thought would stick by you no matter what, are always the ones who are the first to walk out. Tonight I've decided I'm done with those people. As I sit here covered in my own blood, a fresh cut for everyone who's ever hurt me. Well, thats all they will ever be to me from now on. A scar.
-5	negative	self-harm	Throughout my life, I feel as though I have created many versions of myself.  My dad died of cancer when I was 11 and ever since (the past nine years) I have not been the same.  I feel as though my many personalities try to help me through life.  I will tell you about them, just because I've never took the time to really write down what their personalities are like. I hope it's not weird for me to talk about myself in the first and third person.  But at the same I don't really care because Colt and Sam are writing this, so I don't really care what other people think of me right now.
-3	negative	self-harm	Today has been 1 month since I last cut. It's been a rough month and I'm so glad I was able to get threw it without cutting. So if anyone has advice to stop self harm or better coping skills I'm open to new ideas. Thank you for everyone's support
-15	negative	self-harm	Today me and my friend where getting ready for the halloween dance our school was having. I was wearing a pair of sorta see through tights and a above the knee dress. My cut marks where kind of showing and I didn't think much of it.  I thought she bought it but I thought wrong and later when she was in the bathroom I was texting my friend using her phone and I went back to the home screen. She soon got a notification on her phone from our other friend it read "OMFG are you joking" I was a bit worried so I went and looked to see what they where talking about. As it turns out they where talking about what my friend had sawthey where talking about me cuttingI can't even breath right anymore. I'm in a popular group of people and rumors spread fast
-6	negative	self-harm	Today officially I have been one year without cutting! One whole year. I have one this part of the battle, but I still have to put burning behind me. I can't belive it's been one whole year. Man, life goes by so much quicker when you're truly living. Yay!I'm so proud of myself.
-8	negative	self-harm	today was bad usually i can keep myself contained and control things but today it all went so wrong. everything started  to look up, i have a loving boyfriend who i trust and i have my close friend but there are still the people that go out of their way to upset me. today i was told to kill myself by someone i considered my friend and he continued to shout nasty things at me until i walked off and broke down. i am trying not to self harm but moments like these it seems to help, i don't want to. i just need someone to talk to..
-1	negative	self-harm	&& tonight makes me wanna do it all over again  *goes to find my old bobby pins*
-3	negative	self-harm	Trying to leave this tendency to come down upon myself when something does not go well for one reason or another. I know it all comes down to self-esteem and it's hard to build up after so many years of it being low. I can love/respect everyone else, but never myself. 
-4	negative	self-harm	Twice. I lost someone special a few years ago and no recently. Do you know how scarred this leaves you. I blame myself for all of this. I could have tried better to prevent this. I should have.
-1	negative	self-harm	Two months since I've cut and I've never felt better. I cover up the scars but their fading and I can't wait til they're mostly gone. I am so grateful that I've been able to overcome and I will never cut again. There are so many other ways to cope, please feel free to message me if you need help.
-6	negative	self-harm	Two of my best guy friends say they were going to kill their selves because other people have told them to die.  I told both of them how much they mean to me but both of them just pushed me away. luckily they didn't.
-16	negative	self-harm	Unfortunately I'm not sure if this is possible since I was born with OCD & have had severe anxiety since I was a toddler. I believe the anxiety was triggered by my step brother molesting for the first 5 years of my life. Moving forward because my past is very dark & I don't feel like getting into the details of it just yetI have a 2 year old son who is also showing symptoms of OCD/anxiety & it breaks my heart because I understand what he is going thru. I haven't found the right therapist yet & am considering using self help handbooks to combat my OCD thoughts. Although I am currently working with a therapist he has done very little to help me get better. I have been feeling stuck & usually avoid leaving my house on most days. I am obsessed with avoiding people even if I know them. Due to this problem I often think I'll never have close friendships. Can anyone else relate to this problem?
-13	negative	self-harm	We all have habits, don't we? Ranging from chewing your mouth open, biting your nails, chewing on things like pen caps, scratching, and there's some really bad ones too Like I used to self injure, I needed it The feeling of a razor grazing across my skin, clenched teeth, and sweet, sweet bliss. Oh, how stupid and gullible I was to think I needed such a thing, but at the moment I seemed like I was right. I was wrong, but I still think my scars are beautiful. I have many scars and I used to hide them, but now I'm not afraid of who I am. See my scars, think what you want about them and just remember that I am just another person who felt alone and had anger built up and was lost.  Just say I'm pretty this way.
-5	negative	self-harm	We are supposed to be more mature than that, right? Cutting is for angst-y middle-school pre-teens. Or, at least that's what I tell my self. I'm 21 and despite this notion I still find myself tearing into my flesh with my x-acto knife and burning little rings from a cigarette into the soft tissue of my forearm. I feel totally ridiculous when i cut. You don't hear about adults living with this addiction. its a teenage hormone thing, not something adults fight with.  I feel like there is something wrong with me. more so than the obvious "wrong" that is cutting. I'm not supposed to act like this; I'm an adult. Adults don't cut. 
-14	negative	self-harm	Wednesday, May 22, 2013, my uncle committed suicide. he was one of the best people i knew. everyday he posted something inspirational that made me feel okay for once. like someone understood that life isnt always sunshine and rainbows. everyday he helped me make it through my battle with depression. he was a bomb tech for the army and did two tours of Iraq. he came back and was so okay because of the support of my aunt and everyone else in his life. they recently separated because of things unrelated to his PTSD. after she left, his PTSD really started affecting him in a negative way. even the smallest frustrations he couldnt deal with anymore. on wednesday, he rigged his oven so it would blow up the house. he call 911, told them there would be a body, hung up, then blew up the house with him next to the bomb. they didnt find all the pieces of him.  
-1	negative	self-harm	We little knew that morning 
-2	negative	self-harm	Well after NYE but I had to edit the story To make it worse I'm applying for a summer job but I have to disclose if I've ever been a 'victim' of self-harm, I really wanted it and I'm worried that I won't get it if I am honest.
-10	negative	self-harm	Well, all last year I cut, a lot. And I stopped, it took a long time, but I did. It was the best thing I could have done for myself. But the other day I was going through a lot. And the person I usually go for for that stuff, well he wasn't helping. I couldn't take it. So I cut. Only a few times, thankfully, but I wish I hadn't. the past 3 or 4 months I forgot how relieving it was. And now I want to do it all the time. I'm back to my old self-harming self. Yay.
-4	negative	self-harm	Well first of ths is a new diagnosis for me. I have 1alter that I know of so far she my protector.  I learn alittle bit at a time about this diagnosis. So information would be great
-4	negative	self-harm	Well, hey there guys. My names Katie, I'm 17, and I think I'm the weirdest gal ever.  I'm so nervous about this whole situation. I feel like he's gonna think I'm weird.  Help?
-3	negative	self-harm	well, how do i begin? i can finally drive the car, we had to get a new one so that i could and that's how it started. i was reversing it off the drive and i caught the gate i didn't do any damage to the car and it was an accident but my dad started yelling at me and calling me all sorts of names and acting like i'd meant to do it but it was only an accident. i can't cry i won't let myself so when we got home again me and my mum i locked myself in the bathroom with my box cutter and when i felt like i was going to cry i started to slash at my hips. 
-14	negative	self-harm	Well I did it yesterday and I'm finally under 129lbs. But I remember it being a lot easier last time I starved. I once again really i look forward to waking up in the morning and getting on the scales. I'm hoping to be 125lbs by tomorrow morning. I think I can do that, I haven't had anything but water, green tea with lemon and coffee with no sugar since 9:30pm on Monday. I haven't had a single calorie in any way since then. And yesterday I burned off 1650 calories. I'm dreading doing pe tomorrow but ill have to cope. I'm going to make it. I forgot how fun this was.
-7	negative	self-harm	Well I have 2 older brothers and they are awesome but I hardly talk to them anymore, not to worry though. I have always been the black sheep of the family so it's normal, if anyone has worries about if they are the black sheep of the family, I am always here if anyone needs to talk :D

-1	negative	self-harm	Well, it's been about 2 weeks sense the last time I cut.
-22	negative	self-harm	Well this afternoon he returned with a vengeance!   He was now on the ceiling.  Everything and everybody stopped what they were doing and ran into my room to see the elusive spider that got sprayed with perfume.  While my daughter wanted to get a shoe I knew that she would never be able to reach the ceiling.  My son just looked and shook his head as we (my daughter and I) were screaming instructions on how to kill it.  I ran into the kitchen and found bug spray no perfume this time.  Plus I hunted and found bug spray last night so I could be ready.  I sprayed him and he acted like nothing had happened.  My son then said he must have super powers.  He then began to crawl and my daughter then started screaming.  I sprayed him again and he floor to the floor.   Now it was time for my son to dispose of him.  Crisis averted.  I needed to lay down after.  
-11	negative	self-harm	We made it through bootcamp he and I.  He is now in CT at A school. We have been together for 4 years, in March and have had  many challenges that have tested our love. Being in the navy has become our life's  biggest commitment. I am so proud to be his girlfriend and admire him for his sacrifice.  But I can't accurately describe in words my loneliness at his absence. I beg for strength every day.  And I feel silly when I cry over the smallest things that remind me that he's not here with me. I appreciate more than I can say the people on this site. Because when I need the strength and support I come here. Bless all of us who are keeping up and keeping on. 
-13	negative	self-harm	We met over a box of crayola crayons - a big think to a five year old. Lydia and i are still friends. We ride the bus together, eat lunch logether, sleep over at eachothers' houses, get in trouble together, and live life together. Then Lydia called me - to tell me that her older sister, Macy, committed suicide last night. Macy was 18 - five years older then us. After helping Lydia over the hardship, her parents got divorced. Lydia stayed here with her mother, while her father ran off somewhere. A year or so after this, Lydia's mom got cancer. Lydia and I were at the local burger shop, where she burst into tears, telling me how she couldnt live any longer. She had the pills Macy had taken - and told me that she was fully prepared to take them.  Lydia smiled. We are still friends to this day. 
-20	negative	self-harm	We went to a breeder to get a female. The lady was holing him back wanting to keep him but her husband would not let her. She had gone through 500 pups but he was her favorite. There was a man coming to pick him up the next day. She wanted us to have him,she knew we would take care of him. Our vets wife said ,if i could have any dog it would be him.Flip was a black miniture schnauzer.He had the personality of a human .He was the sweetest gentle soul never wanted to harm anything.He died from anemia at 14.5 years old on 5-1-2013 .  It was sudden .He leves behind a bother and sister and two grieving parents. Flip had the best life imaginable . He lived in the house with a doggie door and fenced in yard. I never walked past him without stopping and acknowldging him.I always have and always will love him with all of my heart and soul.I can only look forward to seeing you again one day ,you were my my heart and my life . My heart is broken. The pain is unimaginable.
-3	negative	self-harm	What a strange illusion it is to suppose that beauty is goodness. Tolstoy
-2	negative	self-harm	What happens to these people if the person being lied to decide to press chargers??? That's what I'd be worried about just sayin
-3	negative	self-harm	What if I told you that lighters and razors used to be my only friends? Would you care? Or would shoot me nasty looks and stare?
-17	negative	self-harm	What's been done I can't change. The only thing I can do is fix what's going on now. I have to really reflect on myself and have a vision of where I'm going. How am I going to get there? There's things I used to do, many bad habits (still have some) but I've really tried to quit them. Since I got into a church that preaches the truth a couple of years ago I've tried to stop sinning. I will read about sins in the bible and make a conscious effort to avoid falling into them. I still see myself in a persistent battle some days extremely bad other days are moderate. I'm very critical of my mistakes and I can be very harsh on myself. I look at my failures and it beats at my self-esteem. God and pastors have been clearly my best answer to peace with myself thus far. I can't fix the past God forgave me of my repented past mistakes and He also see's me for what I CAN be instead of what I'm not. I want to feel better God's working and I'm a living example of it.
-3	negative	self-harm	When i cut i feel relieved, in control. No one can stop me from cutting. Thats the one thing i have power over. The pain people cause me hurts, but the pain of the razor on my skin hurts worse.
-13	negative	self-harm	When I first hurt myself, I was talked down to like a dog by my boyfriend at the time. He told me he wasn't mad but disappointed. Then he stopped caring all together. After we broke up I realized I lost the want to hurt myself. He was making me feel so low that cutting felt like an option. I also realized every time he would come back in my life, the desire to hurt myself would come back into my thoughts. I eventually found out that he was harming himself and not for reasons that make sense. What he talked down to me for, he now does. 
-2	negative	self-harm	When I get in a relationship it's really hard for me not to spoil that person .I hate hearing my friends stories that they tell me that their bf or gf doesn't do anything nice for them . I hate that even to the guys that have done me wrong I still like being sweet to them idk why .People tell me to stop but I just can't I love making others happy because it make a me happy
-5	negative	self-harm	When I started I never thought it would get this bad. I just thought once or twice but never that I'd be addicted to watching my blood flow on my skin, slowly making the water red. I've never been so in love. 
-1	negative	self-harm	When I think about certain things and people I panic and get so scared. I feel like I'm being suffocated and dragged underwater every second I have one. I have them everywhere at Anytime in school at home or any public place. My heart beat increased and I feel it all going.
-20	negative	self-harm	When I was 10 I started looking at myself in the mirror thinking why am I overweight. First I started with a healthy diet and it lasted for like 4 months because on the 5 month I was starving myself  thinking that it would make lose weight faster which did. I was underweight. My parents were disappointed and took me to the doctors I weighed 100lbs and I was 5'2.5 my doctor talked to my parents in private and I heard that I needed to go to counselor. They thought I was crazy and mentally ill. My parents then started forcing me to eat by taking away my electronics until I ate. When I was. 10 I weighed 122 but after I starved myself I weighed 100. I excersised 3 times a day and like  for an hour and a half.
-2	negative	self-harm	When I was 11-12 I self harmed because that was the time I was bullied by the popular group of kids. I told teachers and tried to ignore them but they just didn't stop.
-9	negative	self-harm	When I was 14-17 I used to self harm, I'm now 21 and I've recently started again. Quite often it's for things like I'm finding myself annoying, I'm stressed, feeling paranoid that my friends don't want me around, feeling upset or angry over something small but can't stop crying about it even though it's small, or for some other small whiny thing like that. I've never caused any bad damage, I'm convinced that only I can see the scars left from when I was younger. I've never done it badly, I just do it frequently (not so frequently recently). (wow, thanks for reading that, I think I rambled a lot. Thanks for answering and your advice) 
-21	negative	self-harm	When I was 15, I lost my best friend to suicide. We hung out alot and our depression happened to get worse around the same time. We didn't talk much about it because i didnt want to burden her with my problems, but she was the first person I told when i first started cutting and when I was diagnosed. When we needed to, we would confide in each other. The last message she sent me was "I love you K, you're like a sister to me. I know I can trust you" She was still 14,. Even though its been over a year, I still see her in the casket or I see her in my dreams and her laugh isnt the same. She looks dead inside, but when I hug her it feels so real. I just miss her everyday. 
-11	negative	self-harm	When I was in 9th grade all the guys in my class (there were only about 20 kids in my class, about half were boys) would always make fun of the way I would talk. I couldn't say my 'r' the right way. If you've ever seen the movie The Benchwarmers I sounded like the little kid on that movie. I just couldn't say it the way everyone else could. The guys would always make fun of me for it and make me say things like "world" and "purse" which I had trouble with and then they would laugh at me. It made me feel as if I can't trust anyone. It makes me hate myself. I feel as if nobody likes me. So I started cutting. It was an amazing feeling. Seeing the blood rush down my arms I stopped though. I had reached out to a friend in the grade below mine. But he eventually started making fun of me for it. I started cutting again but I know I don't want those scars so I stopped but it always consumes my thoughts and I can't think of anything else. I just don't know what to do.
-6	negative	self-harm	when i was little i was always the awkward shy little girl. i was always very self conscious. i did things to cover up or fix what made me feel self conscious. which made me look more awkward and drew more attention to what i was self conscious about. An easy target for people going through the same awkward thing we call life. i would constantly get picked on and bullied. i grew up realizing those people are so insignificant and what they say doesn't matter. i tore down my own walls and showed everyone what i was made of.  i was never made fun of again. even people my age and older don't have the balls to do what i did. every one is beautiful in their unique way. some people hide their beauty or don't enhance it. some people need to let go and do something for themselves. there is no excuse if i did it.
-2	negative	self-harm	When I was younger and reality was too much to handle and I was too upset to know what to do with myself,I'd freakout and bash my head on walls.I think all the trauma is starting to catch up with me. Maybe my mind is slipping away from meand I did it to myself.
-5	negative	self-harm	When I was younger I took pleasure in harming people mentally. The pleasure I gained from watching my peers crack under pressure was immense. The weaker their mind, the harder they cracked. Actually being violent or murdering someone does not intrigue me, but to bring someone to the breaking point where they consider suicide, that gave me satisfaction.  As a supervisor, I see my past guilty pleasures surfacing here and there. Yet, I believe in occupational integrity so I refuse to indulge in the mental anguish of others; for now.
-3	negative	self-harm	When my cuts get lonely they need friends So I make them new friends  And the cycle never ends
-5	negative	self-harm	When my doctor told me I had anxiety bad and put me on medication I didn't know what to do. I took it a few times when needed but I don't want to take it. I want to control it on my own and slowly I am. My anxiety is holding me back from sleep and going on vacation. Sometimes I cry an because I feel like there is nothing I can do to stop it. Tonight I realized I wasn't alone though and that there is others like me.
-3	negative	self-harm	When my leg looks like a bloody battlefield and then hamburger meat cut up I have to wear a cheer skirt tommarow
-4	negative	self-harm	When people think of cutters most of them think we cut our wrists. This is a wrong assumption most of us have learned by now that wrists and forearms are too visible and we get made fun of or bullied because of it. We instead cut shoulders, legs and other areas that aren't visible and leave the wrist and forearm for the grand finale.  Thabk you
-3	negative	self-harm	When you put your ear to my chest can you hear the pieces of my heart cracking and falling to the floor shattering further? When you look into my eyes do you see it? When you touch me can you feel how fragile I really am? When can I patch up my shattered soul? 
-3	negative	self-harm	"Why Are You Still There?" Anyway, one of the big reasons I have for not looking for work elsewhere is having to go through the torture of job interviews.  I should start now trying to figure out the answers to the types of questions I will face.  I might be ready for those interviews in a few years.  By then, I hope to avoid my grandkids asking me, "Why are you still there?"
-4	negative	self-harm	Wich is a problem but i am who i am i am my self only and i love to eat i love filling my stomach to its limit and to sleep afterwords
-12	negative	self-harm	Will self harm ever get easier to stop? I cant seem to go one day without any more.i think it some point it stopped being about helping myself get through some things and became a necessity ..the need always seems to be stronger the more alone i am but its not like i can constantly surround myself with people like i used toopeople have their own lives 
-3	negative	self-harm	Will the thoughts ever go away? The flashbacks will they ever float away? Will the scars ever fade? Did I deserve this? 
-6	negative	self-harm	Without a doubt, I am.  I know exactly how to stop letting myself get used, it's easy, just don't go out alone to parties where I don't know anyone.  If i'm at a party with friends, nothing happens. It's not even that they have to stop anything from happening, I'm simply a different person, I'm always in control, and can easily say no or stop to anything that get's out of line.. and yet I keep going to the other parties, thinking "oh, i won't let things go to far" but every time, i let it happen again, it's not that I want to go along with things, I just can't stop them from happening.. I'm my own worst enemy because I keep putting myself in these positions, where time after time I have let things go further than I should. 
-8	negative	self-harm	Yeah i stitch over my arms when i am sad. i used to cut but now it is too simple for me. i need more pain to handle me. I love the tears and the shiver and my stiffed body when i pass the needle. then when blood squeeze out and the blood drenched thread looks beautiful to me. I love the phase when i cant feel anything except the intense pain on my arm. I love it when my body stiffens and i force myself to carry on with the process from my wrist to shoulder. I love it when i am at the verge of puking for the pain. Today i am gonna stitch again
-6	negative	self-harm	Yeah part of the whole bi deal xD I love chubby guys xD not overly so but yeah x) idk just how I am and my preferance
-2	negative	self-harm	Yep I self harm, and tomorrow I have to go to the public pool with a friend.  *hides*
-15	negative	self-harm	Yes, i am a teenager. No, i dont do it for attention. Another week had come and gone, bringing depression along with it. I cut myself by the sink. Letting all the pains just flow out. It had been a while since i had done so, but as soon as i looked down i felt nauseous. Although they had been shallow cuts, the blood was still enough. I leaned against the door as i began to warm up. No sooner had i tried to stand up straight, than i fell unconscious to the ground. I had awoken at least 5 minutes later. But i had stood still for about 10 minutes. I just sat there and thought, i was confused. Why had i fainted? I got up, shaky and ill, and i went to bed, awaiting next morning.
-1	negative	self-harm	Yet no one understands the real me!
-13	negative	suicide	12 anti anxiety pills, 4 sleeping pills. went to his house today to get my things, he kept saying he missed me, kissed my nose, and tried to sit close to me, apparently he wont date me but wants to have the option in the future if he changes his mindso i blocked him on fb, deleted his number. and told him never to speak to me again. im ready to live life now. i have a beautiful circle of friends who support me. im a 4.0 college med student. i have so much to live for, so much that would have been wasted if id died. my best friend drove me to the hospital, i was placed on suicide watch. i feel better. better then ive felt in years. i will get over the breakup. and i will be better because of it. 
-16	negative	suicide	1 week ago, there was a very bad incident between me and my teacher. She is one of the teachers who love me, and the previous day she had told my mom the best about me. The next day I wanted to sit next to my best friend. The problem is that, every time we sit together, we ruin the whole class with laughing. The same happened that day. At first she started making funny faces, and we started laughing quietly, but thats what we do: Once we have started laughing, even for no reason, we NEVER stop! She is my FAVOURITE teacher and now she almost hates me. If I ever could go back in time, I would immediatly change that day. I wouldn't even go to school if necessary. But I cant, and I must accept the consequences. This was almost 2 weeks ago but I still shudder when I think of that, and just wanted to share this with somebody else. Sorry for the countless grammar mistakes but English is not my first language.
-3	negative	suicide	About 4 times I tried to All because of bullies in my school and my parents. They all treat me so badly, so the first time I took pills and the other three times I tried drowning myself in the bathtub. I could barely breath the next day and I had no idea what to do
-4	negative	suicide	About two years ago in July, I attempted Suicide but failed because I thought of my friends and that I didn't want to give up so quickly.  I'm still hoping I don't attempt it or nearly attempt it ever again. But for me it's unclear.
-6	negative	suicide	Actually, my girlfriend and haven't really broken up yet but it sure does feel as though I am single.  Jain is everything a guy could wish for.  We've been in a relationship since I was in year 12 and she was in 11.  When I left for engineering school, she said that she'll never see anyone but me and I promised her the same.  Even though i'm still in love with her, it seems meaningless to hold on to that relationship since we haven't seen each other for two whole years.  No Idea what I'll do..
-2	negative	suicide	After a long hard day at work, I've come home watched a film and had a few drinks to wind down The more I sit here and think about it the more turned on I get. The next thing I know is I'm actually getting hard! Hmmm do I start to touch myself? 
-4	negative	suicide	Ahh yes Well aside from the fact that I actually want to die It would be something to bring me to tears knowing I get to pass peacefully Really though Who are we, what makes us us, why am I here
-3	negative	suicide	Ah, trust, this is a thing some people think should be offered at first meeting until the prize is abused, then it should be taken away and re-earned.We want it to be cherished not tarnished.
-9	negative	suicide	All my friends and classmates have this direction to walk into and their lives are taking the shape they want it to, and I am still at the same point I was when I got out of school. I feel like a failure in life and I fear I will end up doing nothing. It scares me more than death. I have this talent and I dont know what to do with it. I have tried making things happen and something always happens and all my efforts go to waste. If you have some suggestions please do share them. Thank you.
-6	negative	suicide	All smokers know that a hard-core group of smokers will, through any means necessary, see to it that smoking will always be for some of the people.  Whether it's true that some of us are "hard-wired" to be smokers ot whether we just allow the addiction to take over really doesn't matter. Either way, we will keep smoking our cigarettes. In doing so we will also stop the almost incessant assault on our freedoms that come from our own governments.The statue was quoted as saying "There's a reason I have a torch lol"
-11	negative	suicide	All things i tried i results in failure..i dint enjoy my life and i wasted most of the holidays at home..eventhough my familys didnt gave money to go tour in schools/college..wat life i am living i dont know..i also have arrears.two months college gng to end if i didnt get any job sucide i only optioneveryday crying my life full of pain..
-5	negative	suicide	Already. I just dropped him off the shelter. He has been fighting with other dogs a lot, he punctured my other dogs neck today so i had to surrender him. I am broken. How do i deal with this..
-6	negative	suicide	Already started the process. Just a little each day and I will finally be at peace. I'm so sorry to my 3 loved ones, but I just couldn't hold on. I went though a lot without ever having found out how to cope when the whole world, including your family is against you. I hope one day you will forgive me. I love you and thank you for always loving me.
-5	negative	suicide	And guys, he went to outpatient twice, they basically told him that he needs to go to detox but he called and called and apparently it's hard to get in there. Why is it so hard? I think he's given up.
-4	negative	suicide	And I will be for the rest of my life. I gave my love my all. We only had 20 days in India. And I loved him more than anything. 
-1	negative	suicide	Anyone wants to cuddle? I'm good at it!
-3	negative	suicide	A poem:   But if you pray for me, I'll be sure to pray for you.
-15	negative	suicide	As the pastor read his sermon over your casket, I looked up at the clear blue sky and wondered if you were up there somewhere, peacefully existing outside of your body. I wondered if you were with your mom. I wondered what it was like, where you are. I wondered if you could see us, as we said good bye to you. I wondered if you saw how many people came and how much they love you.  But I guess I won't know any of these answers until I join you, someday.
-4	negative	suicide	At this point in my life, I have a pretty good idea WHAT I want to be and become during the rest of it. A writer, for one thing. A ridiculous polyglot. Someone who changes the world in some big vague way. So now that I'm not living in that slough of despond, now that I have a modicum of security and stability I still can't answer the question "How?"
-14	negative	suicide	August 29 2013 was my third attempt at suicide failed. I boarded the M train to 34st (herald square) and I walked to the George Washington bridge with the idea of jumping. But since I hadn't taken any diabetes medication my blood sugar soared to over 400 and my vision became so blurred I could not continue. Before that I when to my local train station and laid myself down on the tracks and waited for the train. Two transit workers saw me and dragged me off the tracks. But the next time I'm sure to be successful. The "zip bag"method is a sure fire way to end my life. I have over 100 muscle relaxant pills that i will take, I will put this large plastic bag on my head and lay down in my bead and wait for death to come. On February 1st I will leave my home of 35 years for a life in the street. New York is very cold this time of year so it's likely that I'll freeze to death in the park. Sad ending to a sad life.

-4	negative	suicide	Being single is great, until the sun goes down and you find yourself watching love movies wishing it was you
-7	negative	suicide	Birthdays: supposed to be a day whereon good wishes help one to have a better day than usual.  I am in trouble this year, today has been awful. Thank you family,  friends and world.  You have all proven that you are more important and better than me. I hope it helps you live a fuller life, somehow. 
-4	negative	suicide	    The last time was a few weeks ago. I wanted to experience a severe form of nicotine shock and die. But best friends were quickly react and talk me out of it.There were many attempts but it was really close.
-2	negative	suicide	Bullying causes suicide, and the bad thing is, I'm forced to think about letting myself out of this world each and every day
-1	negative	suicide	"Call me crazy"  not literally though. So don't
-10	negative	suicide	Can You Feel the Love?- "Sociopath" is nothing more than a therapist's opinion to me. I dont believe in Anti Social Personality Disorder. Labeling a variety of mindset as a disease seems incorrect. There are a lot of misconceptions about sociopaths. One of them being that a sociopath displays ALL symptoms of APD. My thoughts are this: Im a diagnosed sociopath that loves my brother. Id be a stone cold robot if something happened to him. I havent felt romantic love per se; but I dont think its impossible. Am I this definitive sociopath? Technically, but only because I display a few key traits.

-9	negative	suicide	Christmas day my parents and siblings with their families came to celebrate at our house. For most of them it was the first time they saw my 16 year old Michael smoking. My parents already had seen him smoke but for he rest it was a new experience but not many comments were made. As it happens my brother's 17 year old, Harold, also started smoking. He started about two years ago but didn't tell his parents until last Thanksgiving. Both my brother and his wife are ex-smokers and aren't too pleased Harold is a smoker now. So I guess smoking runs in the genes of my family.
-1	negative	suicide	Cold metal bites skin  In my rage of alone
-9	negative	suicide	Commiting suicide is always On My mind. I have a whole thing of pills that I've stashed over the months. I've already tried once. I want to try again. I want to accomplish my goal. Of not living. No one understands what goes on in my life. No one gets it. So what's the point of trying anymore? I don't see one.
-2	negative	suicide	Death is my only wish. Someone please grant it
-1	negative	suicide	Doing it right now!!!great feeling!
-2	negative	suicide	Don't commit..Why do you want to commit suicide when there is so much in the world and you have a long way before death. Even when life is short.
-4	negative	suicide	Do you ever wonder why others are so baffled by the fact that you actually enjoy being on your own?That you do it as an active choice rather than by default?  Is it because in a way you're inadvertently pointing out their insecurities? Or does it mean there's something wrong with you for not always craving the company of others?
-13	negative	suicide	Eight pills down. Twelve to go. I hope you're happy. I've read the messages I've received and I'm sorry. Thank you for caring. Thank you for telling me you care when no one else does. The messages are so sweet but I know what I'm doing. I know what will happen. Everyone thinks I'm just another over dramatic 16 year old girl. If they only knew when this all started. I remember self harming for the first time at age 7. Not cutting. But pinching til I bled or touching the candle flame on purpose. I will finally make everyone around me less stressed.
-2	negative	suicide	Especially in any kind of serious relationship!!!..why would i remain with a person who does not love me?   So I can fake appearances and pretend all is good.  I assume there are reasons why couples do this.   I d rather be alone and be a situation that is real not fake.  Id rather date, live calmly with no issues.
-2	negative	suicide	Even now, it's not easy for me to share all the details of this experience. I chose not to mark it as inappropriate for children under 18, because every year there are a significant number of children, under 18, who contemplate, attempt or complete suicide. I give thanks to God, for every day of my life now. I hope that sharing my experience will contribute to suicide prevention..
-2	negative	suicide	Even though sometimes I feel this way when I'm particularly depressed, I would rather die this way anyway, when the time comes. When I was young, I used to want to die in a dramatic and violent way for everyone to see. Now that I'm older and wiser, this would be my choice if I could choose.
-8	negative	suicide	Ever since I had depression, I never really cared if I died. I felt my life was quite pointless and whatever I did didn't seem to matter Now that I'm cured from my dark episodes , I see that life is quite beautiful in way. Emphasizing on he positive parts does help me stay alive. 
-7	negative	suicide	Ever thought of suicide thoughts. Well I know I have many times. But I'm too afraid to do anything I'm a weakling. Don't get me wrong I don't want anyone to feel bad or sorry for me I just want to express my feeling through here. Well I always thought would anyone really miss me or would they just miss me for one day and continue their regular lives just like nothing happened. I bet they say they will but don't really mean it, I know lots of people would be happy if I killed myself, everyone hates me anyways. I've been bullied my whole life to the day I was in elementary till now, high school. Everyday when I get home from school my parents start fighting and yelling, then they start yelling at me saying I'm the problem. I should just kill myself and get it over with, but I have a feeling if I keep living something will hopefully get better in my life.
-1	negative	suicide	Everyday feels like a dream but im not waking up
-9	negative	suicide	Everyday is a constant battle to decide whether or not I am strong enogh to live through another day. I have tried to commit sucide 3 times in the last year. For a new year resolution I want to not try to commit sucide for an entire year. If I cant I hope that my family knows how much I love them. Hopefully I can make it another year.
-14	negative	suicide	Every night I take my dog out when I get home from work. I did not put him on a leash since it was dark outside. I really never put him on unless we go for a long walk. He didn't run off especially at night. Last night was different because I took him out like normal and he ran to chase something across the street. A car hit my dog and they didn't even stop. They just kept going carelessly. My poor baby ran back to me limping and barely able to make a cry. I picked up his injured body and brought him in the house. I laid him down while I searched for an emergency vet. I knew my poor baby was dying as he gasped for air. When I finally got him to the vet they told me there was no heart beat. My heart was broken. I was angry and didn't know what to do. I even refused to see him one last time. I've had my dog for 5 years since he was a pup. He has been there for me through everything. I'm still in disbelief. I feel like it was my fault. It hurts so bad.
-12	negative	suicide	Everything that's happened.. I just want it all to be over.. I chose him again I gave him another chance im in love with him I always will be. He left he said he hates me I just want to go die.. to end the pain..the feelings..the suffering.. I want it all to end.. im debating on swallowing the pills in my hand right now.. theres no reason for me not to anymore..
-1	negative	suicide	Few things in life are as pleasant and satisfying as getting high.  I love it! I wish I could be high all the time, but then it would be a dangerous and destructive addiction. How sad. So I just get high on occasion so as to maximiz the pleasure while avoiding the dangers.
-4	negative	suicide	First of all, it took me a while to find any online support, so I'm grateful I found this Question: How in the world do I help him, help his family become supportive, and get back on the track of sobriety? I myself feel I'm coming to a halt with no answers!
-1	negative	suicide	Getting high or sniffing cocaine definitely doesn't solve emotional health it just pushes it away for a certain amount of time
-1	negative	suicide	Halo lady im single and i need u
-6	negative	suicide	Have you per chance written any posts lately that say you love smoking but sometimes you feel guilty about smoking..,. if so, you are not in control of your own cigarettes, you are letting outside sources have an impact on your own smoking agenda.  that's bad. only YOU know how much you want, enjoy or love your cigarettes. Only YOU can feel it. You should control your own smoking agenda because you are the most qualified to do it.
-2	negative	suicide	Have you seen this dog: i wanna ask: do dogs have souls? i wanna see my dog again i never gotten to say goodbye
-12	negative	suicide	Hello everyone! I'm new to this site and happy to write. I've never written anything anonymously, but it seems like a good outlet. My best friend told me about three weeks ago she has been wanting to kill herself for the past three years. I have done everything I can think of, researching, calling around, talking to her about it. I feel like, despite my best efforts, I'm not helping the way a friend should. I feel like any second I'm going to get a phone call that she's gone through with it and it scares me. I'm the only person she's told and she refuses to let me tell anyone, and I haven't. I know I should tell someone, but I couldn't forgive myself if it backfired. She tries to explain how it feels but, try as I might, I can't relate the way I wish I could. I've never been suicidal or depressed like her, and I feel like I'm thinking us both into a hole. Any suggestions? Thank you for anything, even if you only read this 
-5	negative	suicide	hello friends , i am medical practioner by profession many times u may have noticed in your life that, something u r thinking and the same word or song got spelled by some other person sitting nearby you. it merely confirm that if u release frequency of happiness in your environment , u will definately recieve happiness of other who is attuned to you. and you will be the happiest person.

-3	negative	suicide	Here is a link to a Free Personal Development Audio Book - I hope you can gain something from it :-) 
-2	negative	suicide	Here is something that I would really want or even need to hear from people who post about killing themselves.  It's to short, "its just to much" doesn't give me or anybody anything to go on if we are here to truly help. But I want something concerts, not BS of why it's so hard that you need to kill yourself.
-5	negative	suicide	hi everybody i started a new year i'm going to make it a good year i'm tried of being depressed this year is going to be great but i haven't start off to great i started to cut again. it makes me sad to know I've lost all my progress.

-1	negative	suicide	Hitting my bong to the max then holding it in for a long time is the best sleep aid I've ever found about about! How is the illegal?
-7	negative	suicide	Honestly I'm praying I don't wake up . I can't deal with this nightmares and I can't deal with the reality that also makes nightmares. Everything makes me want to scream and run and keep running and never come back. I even feel abandoned on here because no one talks to me like before.  I am alone so what is the point of me staying.

-9	negative	suicide	I actually plan to commit this act as I see no way out for me. I'm going to wait for 2 weeks and see if my wife comes back to me and after this I intend to end it for the sake if everybody. My wife and my 2 beautiful boys. I've prepared a note (actually 100 pages long) for my family members and Ofcourse my wife And my boys. I hope my wife sees this ultimate sacrifice as my sign of love for her and the kids. I have also included that I'm a victim of a very racist and biased family law court system in Australia that is aimed at splitting families rather than bringing them together.
-6	negative	suicide	I also cannot believe I am writing this, I have had so few good moments in my life not feeling sorry for myself at all I have even asked god to take me instead if a sick child. I have had sle lupus for years the pain is just too much. I want to die with dignity, quite simply I just want to die. Fast easy and cheap
-3	negative	suicide	i always felt alone in this world with no one to talk to and  it's killing me so i your kind enough i would like to be your friend
-8	negative	suicide	I am a caring person with TONS of friends. Everyone sees me as a great person and wonderful daughter but deep down I just don't know what it is but I want to die. I don't see the point in living. The world will just get poorer, kids will get lazier and more electronically dependent,  Americans will get fater and find ways to get lazier, and humanity will no longer be positive Why should I wait for something exiting to happen in this world of pale, desperate, electronic world.

May God bless you as you think of mailing me. I patiently await.
-4	negative	suicide	I am a new member here. I found this site when looking for suicide stories to see if I could get over my suicidal thoughts. I hope this site changes me before I do something stupid. 
-5	negative	suicide	I am bored out of my mind I wish I had nice young man go see a movie with or for drive  walk around London or just have dinner in at home together someone to talk to share my thoughts with not just sitting at home bored out of my mind but on the - side ice just had my wisdom tooth out skin can't do much any way
-7	negative	suicide	I am lonely. I just don't want to be single anymore. I want someone on my life. Someone i can hug, kiss and hold hands with. I want someone who's worth it. Someone who is kind, loving, understanding and trustworthy. I need someone to be my shoulder, I've had relationships but none with a strong connection. I have so much to give but no one to receive. Hell! I just want someone to make out with, but with someone who means something to me when will he come along??
-8	negative	suicide	I am married just 9 months.   I found out my husband is using Drug  with in 3 months.  I knew he used before but he told me he Stopped using . I am 29 and we were in a relationship from 2007 onwards ,  All of this is eating me up .?
-12	negative	suicide	I am miserable. There is no money. The tv is pawned. There is no trust left. Forged checks, lies, he takes everything I have. I worked 3 jobs for a few years just to make ends meet. I pay for everything. I'm struggling. He owes so much money and needs more everyday. The hole just gets deeper and deeper. I am so tired of fixing everything, of fighting, of being unhappy. I don't even know if he's trying to fix things anymore of if he's given up or if he never even tried. He expresses regret everyday but nothing changes. He asks me not to leave him. I don't know why I stay other than the fear that he will try to hurt himself. I get nothing from this "marriage". It's a joke. I am alone. I am taken advantage of, I'm being used. I feel defeated and lonely and hopeless. I don't know what to do.
-1	negative	suicide	I am not sure if I will live a long life nor am I certain I will be successful in something great.  Nothing is written in stone.
-3	negative	suicide	I am sick and tired of coughing constantly, my house smelling like smoke, and my husband not wanting to kiss me.  I also douse myself with perfume right before work everyday to cover up the smell of smoke.   Its only been six hours so far, but I really want to do this.  
-6	negative	suicide	I am simply too unattractive to get a girlfriend. I mean this in every way possible. I am physically ugly. I am overweight, do not have much muscle mass and have no real distinguishing manly features. My nose is too big and I look middle eastern which is a problem in this white centric society. That is just the tip of the iceberg though. I don't see the reason of living when I honestly believe there is no hope for me and that it is who I am that people have rejected all my life. 
-2	negative	suicide	I came home today. I spent 2 days in a hospital because i tried to kill myself. It wasn't even my goal that night, i just cut a little too deep and a little too far up my arm. I didn't mean to
-5	negative	suicide	I can't believe I am writing this. i'm feeling sicktiredfrustrated..upset. I tried to be happy. i pretended to be happy..i just want to be happy. is it too much to ask? 
-8	negative	suicide	I couldn't believe I have lost you. Every time one turns around when I'm thinking of you, my heart always keep telling me you're always with me here. When I look at your pictures, I felt like we will return to day of our lives. Even though I know It won't be possible, because you passed away.     I don't know how long it takes waiting to see you again. I know you're looking down from the heaven and waiting for me right. I miss you with all my heart.
-2	negative	suicide	I couldnt find another Group to place this underanyways should you, the reader ever need some one to talk to before you  do yourself in im hereincase you need a second opinion Its basically a cook book for the many methods one could take there life I post this not cos I want you to use it, as i said i couldnt find anywhere else to post this random thought.
-1	negative	suicide	I didn't think it would hurt this bad. My stomach feels like it's burning. I'm so dizzy. Never thought I'd want the physical pain to stop too. My head too. Just waiting for them all to kick in. Then I can get rid of the physical and mental pain. I honestly don't know how much longer I can take this pain through out my whole body. I hate myself for even regretting this in the smallest way.
-1	negative	suicide	I do indeed have a dark side, so to speak. to many.
-1	negative	suicide	I don't agree with them at all. Unless you're one of these idiots that has to point out that nicotine is a drug. Yes I smoke but I'd never do anything else. Eww.
-9	negative	suicide	I don't do this often at all really, this is the first time I've signed up for something like this. I left my ex nearly a year ago but only because she didn't want to be with me. I loved her and I was really sad for a long time. I'm an amateur kickboxer and I thought I could get over it by pouring myself into my training. I had a few fights within the next few months and decided to leave for Thailand and live at a kickboxing gym. Somehow I was still kind of depressed even though I was doing what I love in a beautiful country. After a month I'm back and still very very sad. I feel useless because I can't get her back and there aren't any fights coming up around here.  I'm sure this post is kind of disjointed but I don't post on the internet ever, so forgive me If this post seems kind of nonsensical.
-1	negative	suicide	I don't flirt with every girl just some girls
-9	negative	suicide	I dont have much that i want to share. I just know that im either going to become an embarrassment, a serial killer, or one more suicide case. Right now there's nothing holding me here except the hope that ill be able to look into the eyes of the one person that really loves me again, or that i can somehow make money off my body now that im numb enough to market. Ive been kind all my life and its gotten me nothing but the self loathing ive grown comfortable with. I have no reachable dreams, no degrees, no desire to boast about my accomplishments, no future. As far as i see it im waiting to die, or to give my life for a worthy cause, like class war. Please, a mercy killing is all im asking for. 
-2	negative	suicide	I don't know how to get over her. She is my best friend and I'm still completely in love with her even though she seems to have moved on.
-3	negative	suicide	I don't know why I'm still writing about this. I guess I just really need a woman that smokes. I love to smoke. Why can't I find someone who shares my passion. Sorry if I'm not using this right.
-1	negative	suicide	I don't remember how I ended up there, I don't know how it all started, but it did, and now I have to wear long clothes because I am ashamed of something I don't even remember doing. I still can't remember the events that happened in those three hours. 
-2	negative	suicide	I don't want to see anyone. I lie in the bedroom with the curtains drawn and nothingness washing over me like a sluggish wave. Whatever is happening to me is my own fault. I have done something wrong, something so huge I can't even see it, something that's drowning me. I am inadequate and stupid, without worth. I might as well be dead.
-2	negative	suicide	I enjoy long romantic walks to the fridge 
-2	negative	suicide	I enjoy playing it. Still it needs to have a friends list
-7	negative	suicide	I feel like my life isn't worth living anymore. I'm severely bullied all the time, no one knows who I really am, and I'm pretty sure the person I love likes someone else, and might be cheating on me. I want to die. Everything has been going on for too long and I can't take it anymore
-4	negative	suicide	I feel that if I were to kill myself, my family would get closer. I want to die to bring my family together. It l's not like there is any other reason to live. I dropped out of school. The bullying and stress got so bad I couldn't handle it. I recovering from three back to back surgeries. My mom was getting sick, but she's fine now but our family is not. There is so much deceit and lies and I want it to stop. I will kill myself there is no stoping it and I will die bringing them together.
-5	negative	suicide	I felt like no one liked me, I didn't feel like people wanted me here, I though "what's the point" but before I did it. It just.. Didn't feel like is should.
-2	negative	suicide	i felt like there was no point because no one really cares if i should or not !!
-1	negative	suicide	If I dont have a new book at hand, I eventually en up reading fanficsstop and squealing, giggling all over the place Haha! xD
-6	negative	suicide	If I miss another day of school, I won't get credits for this trimester and they would have to call a truancy officer. It's hard. To wake up. To eat. To sleep. To even breathe. Being depress hurts. I've come to the point where I want to die.  I want to leave every one, everything behind and die. They're better off without me, i know it. My own dad hates me. O haven't seen him in years after the divorce.my grandparents on my fathers side haven't tell to me either. I'm sick of it. I can't do anything right. So why do anything at all?
-9	negative	suicide	I found this poem before Buddy passed away and it helped me so much before and after his death. I searched for hours on the internet hoping to find something that would take the pain away as much as possible and this one was the closest. I hope it helps you. Please post any poems here that have helped you out - I'm sure we could all benefit from them
-4	negative	suicide	If you'd be a fruit you'd be a fineapple  (this one gets me every time ahahaha)
-2	negative	suicide	If you have Food in your fridge, It's about a thousand other reasons to Thank our Creator!!!
-14	negative	suicide	If you seen my family, you'd be like "omg, you have an amazing life" but no I hate it. My parents are constantly telling me I am a terrible excuse for a daughter It's overwhelming. And there have been times when they have threatened to kill me. Not that I care And one time my mom kicked me out because I was 10 mins late coming home from the library.. It was the library, not that club!! But anyway, I only had on a bra, and a skirt with no shoes on when she kicked me out. I couldve been raped! Thank god I didn't. I had to wait till morning when my dad got off work to get back in. I can't say I'm the victim because I do have an attitude problem but living like this, how could you not? Half the time I'm in my room, trying to avoid my mom but she picks on me, I swear. I've contemplated suicide many times, but I'm actually scared to die. I don't think I want to die, I just want all the pain to end
-4	negative	suicide	I get home. It's only me. As always I'm laying here on my bed with silence. I am craving physical contact. Bad. It's not that I'm needy, I'm just in need of someone's touch.
-8	negative	suicide	I give without receiving. I love without keeping. Every breath I take lacks meaning. My smile can be deceiving. I fake it till I make it, but there is no end, there is always another bend. I find myself wishing I was dead. I hate myself to my core, I want something to soothe my sores. 
-7	negative	suicide	I go to school and no one knows how sad I actually am, not even my parents(although I think they are starting to catch on). I sure do laugh a lot for a person who is dead inside. I think about killing myself everyday, but I choose not to. I go home and keep it all in, and I am so alone. I am not lucky, I feel like no one likes me or wants to listen to me. 
-3	negative	suicide	I got time to live, and time to do better things with my life, rather then wait for a boy/girl to finally see I've been there all along. So yes, I'm staying right here.
-13	negative	suicide	I had to put my best friend down a few months ago. I rescued him from the streets. I met him while I was walking and he followed me all the way back home. He was a black German Shepard. I decided to keep him. He was truly the best dog ever. But sAdely I had to put him down because his stomach flipped. I had to sit by his side as he tried to get up but was to weak and hear him cry. I held him in my arms and talked to him and cried with him. The vet came in and put him down and I broke down. I couldn't handle seeing my best friend being token away from me. Rip sarge :'( gone but never forget I love you little buddy!! 
-3	negative	suicide	I hate it how I will be walking around and I hear some dumb chick complaining that she wants to kill herself because her mom took her phone away. -__-
-1	negative	suicide	I have a horrible life right now . Need someone to talk to . #depression
-7	negative	suicide	I have always been sad for as long as I can remember , nothing in my life felt easy , it wood take forever to explain it all but I'm never happy depression has taken over my whole entire life and no matter what pills I take or what people i talk to that feeling never Goes away sometimes I think everyone would be better if I just wasn't alive
-9	negative	suicide	I have a rocky past and the world is full of judgement. I genuinely feel like I'll be alone. And that devastates me. I've always dreamed of being a wife and mother. I'm not as pretty or thin as most men prefer, and it seems like that's all that matters in this shallow world. I hope that I can find that one in a million love that lasts foreverbut until then I'll be here living life and waiting for a miracle.
-5	negative	suicide	I have attempted suicide several times. The most recent was in October 2013. I took 20 panadols and 15 laxatives before bed and I woke up with horrible pains. I had to go to hospital again.
-2	negative	suicide	I have been addicted to a married man for three years. I have tried many times to let go and move on. It has been the worst three years of my life. It is now over. I would love support to become healthy so I will never put myself through this pain again.
-1	negative	suicide	i have been single for 17 years!!!!!  my whole life! and as i hate to admit it i have never had my first kiss >.&lt;  i just wish i could find someone that i find attractive and that likes me for me and makes me laugh and makes me feel loved and important.. is that to much to ask for! 
-3	negative	suicide	I have been single for a while now. I haven't met that "one girl" yet. Idk when. I hope it will be very soon 
-3	negative	suicide	I have been single now for a year and half. A little about it was we were together for 12 years. But it is never worth staying with someone you are unhappy with. So I finally left. I've discovered so much about myself in this short time. The things I can actually do now as I do dont have a control freak with me is so refreshing. 
-6	negative	suicide	I have been taking presc I'm in an endless slump as of late, as I have more work than I could ever possibly manage, but when I'm on the meds, my mind is FOCUSED on NOT doing my work. 
-8	negative	suicide	I have big thick scars up my arms and across my wrists from suicide attempts. I wanted to end the pain id been in for so long. It took me until my 4th attempt, until my friend had to break into my bathroom at 1am and stop me from bleeding, looking into his eyes and seeing the panic and desperation in them made me realise that I had to do it for them if I wasn't going to do it for me. I'm still suicidal. Everyday say is an uphill battle, but at the moment I can't see me putting my pain into such actions.
-1	negative	suicide	I have committed parasuicide about 7 times  mostly by overdosing once by hanging and a few times by slitting my wrists
-1	negative	suicide	I have had a relatively long track record of attempted suicide. Whilst we apparently live in the world of opportunity, life had never quite gone right. I do not seek sympathy for this, though, like many others do. I have made a pact with myself. If things don't show the slightest sign of getting better by the time I am 30-years-old, I'm ending this whole charade. Going out on my own terms.
-1	negative	suicide	I have lost two dogs and a cat in the past seven years and if you are in this group the word " beloved" says more than just a pet. These are family members we grieve for .so for me, and from me to all of you Special thanks to Hannah for the link to video.
-6	negative	suicide	I have never used drugs or wanted to do drugs. I don't like anything that will mess with my body or my lungs, I know of people in my family that of did drugs and it never ends up well. My sister-in-law was doing cocaine and it made her very mean to be around and super skinny so she looked like a skeleton. Plus I've been in D.A.R.E. and they teach you a lot of things about drugs.
-2	negative	suicide	I have no fear. Life is harder than death and in death I am not weak I am brave to face what awaits me on the other side.  
-9	negative	suicide	I have no idea what I'm ever doing, I pray every night that it will be my last. I've been on a downspiral since the love of my life decided it would be better if we werent together. i thought i'd be fine, but the emotional pain every day is slowley killing me. I don't know what to do I feel like i've lost half of my soul. i've tried suicide and failed, my friend found me overdosing and saved me, but i feel like there was no reason for her to do that..
-2	negative	suicide	I have one on the outside from when I was a baby. And one on the inside.
-2	negative	suicide	I have thought of ten different ways to kill myself in the past ten minutes. I need help.
-3	negative	suicide	I have tried to commite suicide of 30 times and all of them have failed and now I want to stop it and just make some friends
-2	negative	suicide	I have tried to commit suicide before. Whenever I feel worthless or like a failure. Sometimes I feel trapped and feel like it's the only way. I was thinking about it again today. But I had to promise someone I wouldn't. But I still feel like I don't deserve life
-2	negative	suicide	I have tried to kill myself 13 times. And yet here I am. I just end up back in the ER every time. Is it fate or just my soul being to much of a coward to die. I have no reason to live so why am I still here!?
-2	negative	suicide	I honestly don't think I have anything more to live for. Does anyone have any tips on how to get the courage to do it?
-2	negative	suicide	I hope it happens to me someday
-2	negative	suicide	I hope so too but it never happens.
-2	negative	suicide	I just came to realize a small time ago that my parents are not going to be around forever. I really want a wife, that can support me and be there for me, also when my parents are not around in the future.  How do you deal with this? Do you think this is possible? And if so, why doesnt anyone do it? And why are so many people getting a divorce?
-3	negative	suicide	I just cant do this anymore im not able to breathe i will jump i just hope i wont make it alive i hope itll be enough to kill me.
-1	negative	suicide	I just feel as if anything I do is empty. There's no real meaning, none of my actions seem to take a significant role in anybody's life. I would like to have a friend, but just can't find one that stays next to me long enough. Everyone just despises me because I'm sad. Been feeling for years as if I can't go on anymore, nevertheless I've reached a point where I feel as if I am dead, just going on in automatic mode, with no real motivations. 
-2	negative	suicide	I just love to make everyone feel happy it feels so good! :D
-7	negative	suicide	I just read something about this and I come from it at a point like this.  I have always known how I would kill myself, since I was 12 that method of killing myself has not changed (taking the sharpest knife and stabbing it into my bellybutton as slow as I could), I know how to make my self suffer, that way has never changed since then. So for me it's kind of a messed up way of no I'm not but If I LET IT go that way I know how to do in a suffer the longest, that hasn't changed in the years.
-11	negative	suicide	I just went through a lot in my life that I barely recall happy moments or memories. I tried to commit suicide many times, but it wasn't quite serious. However, in June 2013, I was done with life. I was in a very hard period of my life, and lost everything that was worth it. My family started accusing me of things I haven't done. I just couldn't take it, and felt like "I will let no one take my dignity from me by accusing me, and maybe beating me. This will never happen" I went to the drugs cabinet and took EVERYTHING was in it. There were LOTS of pills and medicines that I didn't recognize, because I live with a big family, and many of them use medications. I went to my room, locked the door, and I put all the pills in my stomach, (I don't remember how many, but I assume more than 50 pills). Plus to that, I drank some medicines too. I felt really sick when I forced my self to do that, I was crying and sobbing. Until this day, I feel sick when I see pills around me.  
-3	negative	suicide	I kicked my husband out a month ago for cheating and we are currently in the divorce process. I've already slept with someone else  and been asked on date but I feel more lonely than ever. I hate it. I have no one to talk to but my 2 year old and let's be honest, it's not exactly stimulating conversation. I feel like no one will like me because of my weight and situation in life.
-5	negative	suicide	i know deep inside i still wanna die even though im healing, but what i think of is death, i have seeked help from so many people i got the help but sometimes i feel too big of a burden. my thoughts never go away, i have horrible thoughts they eat me up every night. even though im living today and say i wont attempt suicide again, i deep down know how much am i suffering each n every day, i feel lost most of the time, im only living, im so forgetful, i dont feel okay, i never feel free how hard i try. tthe feelings never leave me, i dont think im living these days, i feeel super trapped inside a cage. things are better than before but no i dont think i can live, i still am here, im not suicidal but im not living. things dont feel right, i dont feel like getting up in the mornings and living my life, i make up my mind most of the time, but sometimes i fail
-23	negative	suicide	I know how you feel:/ I had gotten a pitbull mix when he was 7 weeks old. I had him for about 4 months . When we got him we didn't realize that dogs weren't allowed were we lived.he is about 4 1/2 months . Today in the morning the landlord came and when he saw tiger(dog) he said that we had to get rid of him..my heart dropped . I did not want to give him away! He was my BESTFRIEND we did every thing together he followed me every were. He was so sweet he lived kids and other dogs but the landlord didn't budge . I had to give him to this no-kill shelter in Greenwich . When I dropped him of I burst into tears! I could hear him whining when they took him. I can't get over him he was my best friend I don't know what I'm going to do with ought him
-11	negative	suicide	I know you lied.  You didn't know I could see you or that I had to watch everything play out right before my eyes.  You continued to swear  you were mine, even when I knew you were loving someone else.   You didn't stop to think for an instant, you would be caught in a lie.  Of course once you were, you sweetly tried to smooth it over with excuses and more lies.  You still didn't know I had seen you with my own eyes.   The look on your face was priceless, when I presented the photo, the phone records and the hotel receipts.  Your mouth opening and closing like a fish out of water.  I tried to tell you - I knew you were lying.  
-1	negative	suicide	I like flirting. it's fun. Talking with someone when bored. 
-11	negative	suicide	I like to be alone sometimes. I find that when I'm alone I am myself, or at least I am who I am and no one is influencing that because you know, I'm alone and all. And you have time to think without the influence of others. But it's also nice to have somewhere there sometimes. I think it has to be a balance.
-4	negative	suicide	i live with the 'carved into my soul' marks.every day. i aslo live with the coming out out the coma. pulling that tube out of my mouth, because i din;t know, being tied down because i didn't know, my mother crying on the other side, the waking up, that sweet nurse washing my body, that repast. but i know, what my arm look like. 
-6	negative	suicide	I'll kill myself. I've been trying to hold on. But deep inside I know the day will come. I know that's how my life will come to an end, I don't really believe I'll live past 30.  Just one moment of weakness, just one bigger, more serious problem that's all it takes. 
-8	negative	suicide	I lost my dog Wolfie last Saturday, Sept 7 of cardiac arrest after his poisoning treatment from the vet. It was unexpected, we thought he was OK as the Vet releases him from the clinic. It was the darkest day of my life and I never would have imagined to feel this paralyzing pain of losing him. He is such a sweetheart and our source of joy and life without him will never be the same :-( We'll see each other again, baby! We love you!
-4	negative	suicide	I lost my father to cancer on May 28th 2013.  He was so sweet and kind.  I miss calling him and hearing his raspy voice from all the years of smoking.  I also feel guilty about not visiting as often because of the smoking.   He was just shy of his 80th birthday and l feel like he showed me so much about what a husband and father should be.  He was devoted almost too much. My mother didn't deserve him.  He was far too special for her venomous heart.  My brother can never even come close to the man my father was.  My brother is selfish, greedy and narcissistic, but that belongs on another experience page. But for meI always appreciated his heart and strived to be  just half the person he washe wasn't even my biological father.   I just love and miss him with all of my heart.
-8	negative	suicide	I lost my husband on Oct 31, 2013.   he was electrocuted on the job.  he went to work on Monday Oct 28 and never came home.  this is the hardest thing I have ever had to try and get through.  I cant stop crying.  Our 21st anniversary was October 17.  the flowers he gave me were still on the dining room table.   We didn't have a lot of outside friends.  we did everything together. grocery shop, tv. everything.  I don't know how Im going to get through this. some days I think I can but every night it gets harder and harder.  all of our children are grown so I don't have that to keep my occupied.  I went back to work a week later because I was afraid I would lose my job,  I cant concentrate or focus on anything.  All of his things are as he left them.  I cant bear to move them.  
-2	negative	suicide	I lost my little brother and his girlfriend July 9th 2013 to heroin overdoses. It's the hardest thing I've ever had to go through. We were very close. My heart still hurts every day.
-10	negative	suicide	I love hugs, cuddling and all of that but sometimes I'm really unsure about physical contact- especially with my family. Most of the time I live in Australia with just my mum and dad and it's not unusual for me to go several months without a hug or real physical contact. At the moment I'm overseas visiting my family, my really physically affectionate family. Random hugs, cuddles or whatever are pretty normal- which I love. Though when it comes to giving hugs, resting on family or being close- I always get self conscious of what I'm doing- but I don't want to stay away and seem cold. I'm sure I'm probably over thinking it and that it's all fine- but I'm just not sure sometimes.
-3	negative	suicide	I love nice guys! I met a few, dated some, and am with one now I love my nice guy 
-9	negative	suicide	I love smoking and never regretted starting.  Smoking is a big part of who I am and I now have two sons who have joined me, both my my 15 year old and 14 year are smokers now. At first it was strange to see them light up but now I am used to it  watching their addiction grow by the day makes me proud of them. They enjoy their newfound habit as much as I do.
-3	negative	suicide	I love to cuddle haven't had any one to love or just to cuddle with for over 1 1/2 years :-( 
-3	negative	suicide	I love to flirt but I hate when ppl think since you flirt you available
-10	negative	suicide	I'm 19, I'm getting wrongfully accused of 'sexual assualt' by an old good friend that I would not dump my ex for. I'm losing my car license in around 28 days (for 6 months) and all my good friends have started seeing other people and I no longer get invited to anything at all. I feel as though I'm alone even if I'm with people and I'm constantly upset, I've been thinking for the last few weeks that suicide might actually be the better option for me. As If I get found guilty for this crime I DID NOT commit I won't be able to get citizenship in Australia (where I am now) and won't be able to chase my dream job Cause who hires a criminal these days
-8	negative	suicide	I'm 43 years old and have felt miserable for very many of my days since I was 14. I don't get the people that say that feeling this bad is temporary. Really, it's my life. Feeling good is temporary; horrible misery is reality. I've been on various anti-depressants for probably over half of the past 20 years. I've seen various specialists - psychiatrists and psychologists. Lately, I've been seeing a psychiatrist for the past 3 years and been on a fairly high dose of an anti-depressant and yet I go to bed most nights just praying that I will die somehow - disease, accident, or murder I don't care which one just something to end the years and years of feeling awful.  I wish I could believe the myth that things get better, but after 27 years and many treatments, it's hard to believe that life will ever be anything but this bad or worse.
-2	negative	suicide	I made some amazing friends a few weeks ago. Yesterday I found out that they robbed me blind. My business is ruined. I want to die. I am so numb from the act of their betrayal. I won't even feel the blades. It won't even hurt to die. 
-6	negative	suicide	Imagine this. What if when we are born oxygen is our poison. Oxygen is what kills us slowly. What if it's what makes us look older. What if oxygen is a poison slowly killing us but we all die of it at a different time. I know this is not true but I think it's a crazy thing to think about
-6	negative	suicide	I'm a nice guy with a good heart. Yet I have been single forever. I can admit I try to be mean just to joke around. Sometimes I think lust is only is out there and no love. Sometimes I ask myself if I am prepared for a relationship or if I'm worthy of having one. I would do anything for a true honest relationship.
-2	negative	suicide	I'm a recovering drug addict I relapsed and I'm back clean I am 32 days clean . (:
-5	negative	suicide	I'm coming up on my 6 months of sobriety. It's been quite the road! I had a year and three months and then I took a drink in March. I was immediately drinking every day again. The monster was loose and I could not stop, again. I thought drinking would quiet the obsession but it just exploded. After a painful,disgusting, scary four months I got sober again on June 28th.
-4	negative	suicide	I'm done!!!!! I'm tired of everyone leaving me, this depression is not ending any time soon, I'm a waste of space and not wanted. I even asked for help today and I didn't get it, this shows no one actually cares. Maybe tonight's the night.
-2	negative	suicide	I mean it happens!!Maybe its the drinkWHO KNOWS! 
-2	negative	suicide	I meanwho doesn't? Unless you like girls, that is.
-6	negative	suicide	I'm feeling so melancholy and unable to deal with the long holiday weekend or the parties. At least my work distracts me from this feeling and gives me a sense of purpose. I want to turn my phone off and disappear. I'd go somewhere totally desolate, calm, peaceful. Just myself, my wine, my negative thoughts. Surrounded by nature. Let the trees absorb my bad thoughts and mental anguish, then come home feeling much lighter.
-1	negative	suicide	I'm fuked on blue cheese and I'm loving it.
-3	negative	suicide	and started crying . i miss him so much it hurts i just hope he remembers me !
-3	negative	suicide	 I don't really know why I've even been feeling like this lately. At first I was just a little depressed, but then it just started getting worse and I started feeling even worse. Now I just keep thinking about suicide and stuff like that's and it's really scaring me. There are sometimes when I really want to die. Even the slightest thing could se me off feeling all depressed. But it hasn't been as bad lately so I'm a bit hopeful that I'll be fine soon.
-5	negative	suicide	I'm in my early 20's, and I have never dated or been in a relationship. For the most part I'm okay with being single. Sometimes, I think I like the idea of a relationship more that I would actually enjoy being in one. But at the same time, the thought of ending up alone scares me.
-2	negative	suicide	I'm in so much pain. There's been many times I've thought of taking a handful of pain pills.
-4	negative	suicide	I miss his body and the cuddles it gives. Looking at us we may not look like a "typical" couple but we are. I wish we were together and he was holding me. I am missing the contact and want his arms around me holding tight. The blankets are a sad imitation of his warmth.
-1	negative	suicide	I'm laying in bed crying my eyes out! I just feel lost and out of place like I don't belong here. I give and give to everyone to make them happy and I get nothing in return, I give in to their wants and needs and no one gives in to mine ever, I'm tired of being here everyday it gets harder to put a smile on when I just want to curl up in a ball and die. I think about suicide often and how I would leave this place but I won't do it, not now there's still a few people that need me here and that's the only reason I stay
-3	negative	suicide	I'm looking to talk to some girls. Ages 16-25. Any kind of girl. It doesn't matter about what she's into.
-1	negative	suicide	I'm new ._. I got super high right now ^_^
-13	negative	suicide	I'm not against online relationships but i prefer someone that lives in oregon USA like me. Well to start off I know what I want. I'm super picky. I know that that's bad. But I want to have a bf that I'm attractive to. So lets see: I want a boyfriend that is at least 5'8. Thin-average weight, medium-long hair, preferably a metalhead (I listen to all kinds of metal, so would be great to be able to listen to that kinda music together), I'm sorry to say thisbut I'm really only attracted to white skin guys (sorry of that sounds racist. I'm not racist I have friends of all colors)! So that's pretty much all for the look part of a bf. oh glasses would be a mega plus! yer, down to earth, not afraid to be crazy and weird in front of people. That's pretty much I can think of!
-3	negative	suicide	I'm really bugged by suicide not being written correctly. Anyway, yeah, I tried to hang myself in August. I bungled it myself so no one knows. Why did I stop myself? Moreover, why do I even want to die? It's weird. I'm sad all the time, but I'm calm. I don't do rash things. I don't lash out. I don't skip school. Then one day while I was picking onions for my mom I just walked into the barn and tried to hang myself with an extension cord. No I don't feel lucky to be alive, nor do I particularly want to try again. I'm caught in between now.
-2	negative	suicide	im really finding it difficult, I dont know what to do, I was in hospital for 4 weeks and t didnt do anything to help me, my diagnoses is schizophrenia because of my PSYHICosis. I cut, I feel sick, I want to end it but cant, im forced to take medication, I hate it
-2	negative	suicide	I'm really terrified of zombies and I usually have nightmares about zombies. 
-12	negative	suicide	I'm seriously tired of hearing people say: "it's no big deal and besides maybe they should have been stronger!" Well you know what? Maybe they were VERY strong, but you tore them all of the way down that that was their only choice because living was hurting them way too much. I can see how people think that it's selfish, cause in a way, it is. Taking such a great, beautiful, and amazing away from this world. Especially family and friends. But see, the thing is If someone is that low They think that life would be better without them. Which isn't true, but people can make them feel like that. So everyone, please Watch what you say and think before you speak. Because they may not be here for you to apologize to tomorrow.
-3	negative	suicide	I'm single and although it hurts sometimes (especially at night), I am becoming stronger and more confident in myself. I'm getting my spunk back! And when I find someone who truly appreciates, loves, and cares about me; I will be so happy and grateful! But I will NEVER let someone bring me down ever again!
-20	negative	suicide	I'm still coming to terms with the fact that I tried to kill myself. It happened a long time ago, over a year ago I think. I still have trouble grasping the fact that I honestly tried to commit suicide. I still think about killing myself almost daily, but I haven't tried to do it again. It happened like this: I took a lot of pills, I wrote a note, and I waited. After awhile I ended up vomiting all the pills. I stayed home for a couple days and my parents thought I had the flu. To this day, they don't know I tried to kill myself, and neither does anyone else. I still  can't believe it myself, but I honestly tried to kill myself. The scary part is, I want to try again, and I've come up with much better plans than pills.
-1	negative	suicide	I'm still single  UK 16. The girls in my area are not good people so I don't like any of them, I came here in hope of meeting someone.
-1	negative	suicide	I'm tired. At some point, you get tired of getting up after being knocked down. That's me. 
-7	negative	suicide	I'm tired..I'm tired of crying. I can't help it. I miss him so much that I will drown myself in whiskey and vodka hoping that I wont wake up sometimes. I don't care how selfish it sounds. My dreams, my future, my everything was ripped tragically away from me and I'm left here to try and pick up the pieces.and by myself. I just am not strong enough even though I was for him when he was here. I was always strong when he was here.  Why not take me? He had so much to live for. I've done so much already. Why not someone else? I just want to be with him again. 
-15	negative	suicide	I'm tired of people telling me I'm strong. I know I am. I've lasted this haven't i? But they don't know what's going on. Thank you to the people who have tried to talk to me and help me on here. It means a lot. But I'm just too tired. Having Alopecia hasn't made it any easier. I'm tired of the drugs going back and forth thru my house. Tired of trying to make them happy. Tired of going to school just to feel horrible. People know. They know I have no hair. They know I've cut. But only 2 know my whole story. And they haven't helped. So I'm lost with what to do. I have everything ready. Plenty of pills. Blades lined up. The shower will be on. I know I'll hurt someone by doing this but I can't do it. I hate these voices telling me I'm worthless. I'm sorry.
-3	negative	suicide	I need to put my 16+ year old yellow lab to sleep, should I bring his best buddy, also a 3 year old lab, to the vet with us to be apart of putting him down so he is aware of what's happening, and so he knows why we didn't bring the old one home? or will he understand? Any thoughts on this will be appreciated.I am going to do this Tuesday. Pray I have the strength. I will see all of my animals in heaven. Scott
-2	negative	suicide	In the words of Blanche Devereaux . "I'm from the South. Flirting is part of my heritage!".  Truer words have never been spoken. 
-4	negative	suicide	I O.Ded one two types of drugs and was nearly gone by the time I was rushed to the ER. It's surprising that they were able to save my Liver and Internal organs before they were completely and permanently damaged. I am at home now still recovering after being let go from the hospitals adolescent facility, and now I'm dealing with the pain now since my organs are trying to heal what was damaged. Mostly my tummy :l
-7	negative	suicide	I often wonder, if I committed suicide how many gasps, cries, screams, tears or words would be spoken as a sign of love. But then I remember its late and I'm alone, tired, scared, sore and silently screaming for help. No one really notices, cares, thinks, shows any sort of attention. If I were to commit suicide, please don't say you missed me, loved me, cared for me, found beauty within me, or I should have tried harder. Because I wouldn't have these thoughts with blood stained wrists if you missed me, loved me, cared for me or found beauty within me.
-10	negative	suicide	I only tried once. I was one of those people who knew how to successfully kill yourself. I can say its a miracle I'm still alive, not that I even believe in miracles.  There's so much more to the story. If you could see me now you would see one of the most satisfied people alive. The happiness in my life isn't anti-depressant, nor delusional. Being alive today has brought me more happiness than ever before. I count that as a miracle, even though I don't believe in miracles. I look now at the scars on my wrists. I smile at them, and sometimes I cry. I cry for the friend I lost, and I'm happy for the life I can continue. It is a paradox, but its the truth. If I could tell you any differently, I wouldn't be writing this down. 
-3	negative	suicide	I promised a friend that if they (singular) killed them selves i would fallow soon after.
-4	negative	suicide	i really so and i dont even know why anymore i used to have so many reason now my head is just filled with an empty blackness and i just now i need to go worried i wont be able to stop myself from attmpting soon all my other attempts have obviously failed but on day ill gget i right. i want help but i push it away i saw my therapsit today and propelty said yeh im fine actually never been better got loads of plans when inside i was crying and begging for her help now i cant even talk to anyone verbally im that empty cant even speak just look at them unable to form words unablke to live
-3	negative	suicide	I really want to help him but i do not know how. He will disappear at the weekends with his phone turned off all day then turning it back on at stupid o clock in the morning, then monday he will not go to work. I desperately want to help him as i am the only person around him who doesn't do drugs and never has done but he is more interested in spending time with his friends who do. I want to help him before it's too late but I am helpless. It was pay day on friday, he disappeared off the face of the earth at the weekend and today (monday) his phone has been constantly switched off. I fear he spent all his wages again!
-3	negative	suicide	I relapsed. Just about 2 days ago now. All I'm worrying about is PE in school, or if I ever get changed or have to take my jumper off in front of someone.
-2	negative	suicide	I roll up u roll up they roll up we all roll up! Who wanna roll up 
-12	negative	suicide	I say our Earthly goodbyes to one of the most incredible men I have ever met in my entire life. My family is grieving the loss of my grandfather I feel the empty void very clearly. The head of the family is no longer here with us, and we feel his absence sharply.But I know that he is no longer in pain, and is now in a place that is more amazing than the best possible day here on Earth. I also know that this is just a temporary goodbye. I know I will see him again. I am counting on it. love you grandad and always will do xxxxxx
-19	negative	suicide	I see the ages of the people in these stories and I think, I felt the same way they did at 16 and 32 and I'm turning 50 this Dec. How I did it was thinking of everyone it would hurt. But now, I could really care less. These are 30 plus yr friendships, they all say "I love you n care" then blink your eyes and their ACTIONS say a whole other story. I've finally kicked everyone out of my life and am just waiting for the right "time"! In a week they will have forgotten I exsisted and all their lives will go on as they did the week before. All done worrying about how others will feel or be effected. They've all shown me what they think with their actions. Don't cry your fake tears for me that's for sure. I was ALWAYS told I was a mistake!
-2	negative	suicide	I smoke alot of cigarettes. About to put on my coat and go out for one actually. I'm 17 and almost independent. Hate the fact that I can't buy my own cigs yet even though I work full time and can obviously afford my nicotine and thc habits. I also really hate the fact that i can't smoke indoors because my moms against the smell. I respect her though I love my mom.
-1	negative	suicide	I sometimes think about committing suicide but I know that I can't leave my two best friends behind..
-7	negative	suicide	I spoke to a old associate of mine today and she said "I am happy things are better for you now" I thanked her, laughed, and in my head I thought "Man I must be getting real good at hiding the way I really feel"  as soon as we finished our conversation and I was alone I curled up in a ball and began to cry, sobb, scream!!!  Dont judge a book by it's cover they always say.  Truth is I am not ok, nothing has chaged, I am no longer warm blooded everything about me is cold-my heart my feelings-everything.  I have become one with my pain!!!  Even when I am laughing it hurts on the inside.
-5	negative	suicide	I started having bad arm pain in September and  was admitted to three hospitals this month. Not a single doctor could figure out why I was in such agony and pain in my arm, but began prescribing myself with pain killers, percocets, vicodin, morphine and muscle relaxers. So far I have been on them every day for a complete month now. Finally saw the last doctor and found  amoeba parasites in my blood stream. If I go a day without any painkillers I feel achey, chills and fever and once I take them again I feel completely normal. 
-9	negative	suicide	I started to cut again in August and i can't stop. I want to stop so bad but I can't. Its addicting. Whenever i'm upset, i just go into my bathroom and do it. My boyfriend and my best friend have helped me out a lot, but i still do it very often. If I make it five days without doing it then its been a good week. My boyfriend has tried so hard to help me, and he makes it alot better for a while, but i still find myself in that bathroom at the end of the day. I want to stop more then anything else but i can't

-2	negative	suicide	I think about it everyday and I've attempted it before.
-1	negative	suicide	I think about trying to commit suicide again almost everyday
-4	negative	suicide	I think I am I spend to much time with myself #imaloner
-4	negative	suicide	I think it might be best to stop all the pain. Stop how I'm feeling, stop me cutting because I will be dead. I know it sounds stupid but I don't think I can cope with life for much longer.
-2	negative	suicide	I think it's kinda hot when a guy is bi
-5	negative	suicide	I think I will be forever alone. No one even knows I'm here. Sitting on the stairs and no one has even realised. I'm actually invisible. To everyone
-9	negative	suicide	I think there are two things people associate with people being single and that is :   However in my opinion, I am neither. I just like being single. I'm at a place in my life where I just want to focus on myself and be selfish. I want to wine and dine me. All day everyday. Remember it's always important to love yourself, and cherish everyday you have.
-6	negative	suicide	I took a stand and stayed away from fatty food for one month an I feel so great. I am a person always eating and always saying tomorrow I go start eating health . But I made that stand n im so happy I did it for me. 
-3	negative	suicide	I took like 7 neproxin, witch is like 1,540 mg, people don't say it does much but I know it was doing something
-10	negative	suicide	i tried about 5 times already. the first two times were because of bullies. the next two were because i just gave up on life.  the last one was for two reasons first reason i fought with my parents on that night and the second reason was because i was just hurting  in more ways than one so i just wanted to end it all.
-3	negative	suicide	I tried because I know that nobody would miss me. Because my girlfriend who promised to never leave me did. Because I'm worthless
-1	negative	suicide	I tried but I'm scared! N I want to try again I hate life
-4	negative	suicide	I tried commit suicide when I was 2nd grader I was being bullied all the time and call me bad names so when my family whats not around I took a knife in the kitchen I was going to stab myself but I can't do it I don't know why, but when I realized that someone going to miss me My Family,Friends and my loved onesSo I said to myself "Why am I wasting my life because of that" I put the knife back to the kitchen and go to my computer and like it never happenToday I have a wonderful life now. I changed school I made lots of friends there a anti-bullying law now too I'm very happy about it. But I will never forget what I did back when I was a 2nd grader. My family still doesn't know about it.If I'm ready I'm going tell them about itsomeday
-2	negative	suicide	I tried last night. I took a bunch of sleeping pills and cut. But my best friend / fighting buddy saved my life again.
-9	negative	suicide	I tried to commit suicide last February when things were really hard for me. I lost all of my friends and my family wasn't around much but things are starting to get better for me now but I was wondering if anyone has any ideas on how to stop cutting. I've been doing it since I was in seventh  grade and I really want to stop but it still happens a lot. 
-13	negative	suicide	I tried to commit suicide. One night, I was just feeling really depressed. Depression & sleeping pills do not mix. I wanted to take the sleeping pills slowly, so I wouldn't have to be in so much pain. I took three sleeping pills, waited a while, then took three more. And then, I took four more sleeping pills. By this time, I had taken 10 sleeping pills. I passed out, and fell asleep (ironically) before I could take the rest. I woke up, and was numb. The world was in slow motion. Was this a sign? Was some benevolent God keeping me from swallowing a bottle of sleeping pills?
-4	negative	suicide	I tried to kill myself back in Aug.  obviously it failed.  I am not used to failure, and the things that have happened since have not changed my mind about killing myself.  If anything, I am even more determined now. welcome to the party.
-3	negative	suicide	I tried to kill my self last night I took pills and drank vodka. But I ended up puking it all up. I really wish I didn't puke it up
-4	negative	suicide	I tried to kill myself last year and nearly succeeded. I spent a week in the hospital and was weak for months afterwards. My friends all think I just did it for attention. None of them actually think I'm suicidal or depressed. I starve myself and cut but I hide it from everyone else. I'm trying to stay strong but it's hard.
-6	negative	suicide	I tried to kill myself on October 7th 2013. I was sitting in my room with my gun to my head when my bro walked in. He didn't say a word he just took then gun and embraced me. That's why I'm still here today he saved me.
-1	negative	suicide	I tried to kill myself when I was 12..and here I am. I've been in a mental hospital twice and I'm pretty sure I will wake up there soon.  I don't cut because it is not pain enough to release the demons that I battle inside.
-2	negative	suicide	I tryed over 10 times now.  I tryed just last night.  When I was hanging my self with a belt   It didn't work. And not untied and I fell.  I was so sad. I just wanna die ;(
-1	negative	suicide	It's a waste of time being with the wrong person, no?
-17	negative	suicide	Its been 4 months. And now .. Really am. Im crying inside and out. Im here in my room and im really crying out loud. Looking back, My father sents me message on facebook ladt month but i dont sent him back a message because im frustrated that time and deep inside im mad and i dont know why. Then today i checked his facebook on i saw his latest picture. He was holding a baby and he was ok i think.. But i look close to his face and it seems his not ok and happy, hes like trying to smile but in the picture he looks sad. And it really breaks my heart So much. It breaks my heart because we dont talk and i really miss him It breaks my heart because its been four mothbs and we dont talk. Im really depressed this year . U know it really hurts because i been keeping hatred and it really breaks my heart to him because we dont talk Do u think he miss me too??? I wanna talk to him and hug him and tell im sorry I really miss me . The girl with a simple heart.
-3	negative	suicide	Its been 6 months and I still really miss her. She had a good life and for 17 years we did everything together. I miss the fluffy little bugger to distraction. People think "oh well it was just a dog"  but she was a massive part of my life and probably closer to me than any other living thing including my parents and siblings. I have never lost anything so important before.
-8	negative	suicide	It's going to be this year. I've finally come to terms with myself and that it's going to happen. I've started to distance myself from friends and family. My mother wants me to get help, but I can't see it doing much. Therapy never did much for me in the past. I kind of just want it to be over.  
-3	negative	suicide	It's never okay to HIT a woman. Even if she's acting crazy! Just hold her down or tie her up but don't ever lay hands on a woman I don't know what's wrong with people today thinking that this is okay but it is not. :/
-13	negative	suicide	Its Tuesday,  I'm still in bed. I just want to sleep forever. My heart breaks every time my grandson goes back to mother. This time is getting harder to deal with this misery. My son and I had very hard time putting grandson on car seat. He was grabbing on to me screaming saying he wants to go inside house no mom. He is two years old. He loves animals we reward him with two books that himself chose. He looked at like ten books and he likes to go through each page to see if will like the story. He gets always scared and he doesn't want to go anywhere because he thinks he is going to moms. Today I don't want to get up I just want to sleep all day.
-1	negative	suicide	It's wrong yea, but it's eternal relief nothing really else to say..
-14	negative	suicide	I turned 20 yesterday. Every year I tell myself, "I will find love this year", I am so determined yet all I receive is heart break. Life is a weird twisted place but surely in this crazy dark abyss I can find someone who will love me for me. Someone who will complete me. I know people say that you can't find love unless you love yourself, well I can't love myself until someone else does first. It's all that's missing my life and I know finding someone would cure my depression. Please, please, please, let this be my year. Let me find love, curb the heartbreak and be treated with the love and respect I deserve.
-4	negative	suicide	It was a day like any other but still something was wrong. I knew right from the moment I woke up that I wasn't going to school today. But seriously, don't try it.
-3	negative	suicide	It was Feburary 2003.  Sometimes I wish she wouldn't have found me on the deck. Sometimes I'm glad she did.
-2	negative	suicide	I used to be a tweeker big time. I just celebrated 6 years without meth on December 15. Never thought I could do it
-8	negative	suicide	I've always been a little bit of a daredevil, and will try almost anything, but lately I've been experiencing some anxiety in being it tight closed places like small caves.  This is new to me as I've been caving since I was a teen, but for some reason I've recently started to panic when I'm confined like that.   Two weeks ago, on a small 8 passenger plane, I sat in the back of the plane where there was very little room.  The trip was quite uncomfortable for me and was so happy when we finally landed and I got out.
-6	negative	suicide	I've attempted 8 times and 3 of those times  I was really close. I know I can do it. I will make it this time. I will succeed. I'm ending it tonight. I know it will make so many things easier for everyone.
-2	negative	suicide	I've attempted 8 times and backed out of an attempt recently the other day, thanks to a few people on this website and my best friend. I am working on everything in order to make life better for myself and hopefully I'll be okay.
-3	negative	suicide	I've been a beach girl my whole life. I'm pale and burn so easy but I love the sun and warmth of it. I like to lay in the sand and just soak up vitamin D.
-8	negative	suicide	I've been clean for about a week now, and it's killing me. I don't know how long I can last with this. If you haven't already guessed- Yes, I am talking about suicide. It's not that I have a bad life, because I don't. I have a caring family, a couple nice friends, a roof over my head But I just feel like I want to die. I feel as though I wasn't supposed to be placed on this earth. why would a failure, hopeless person like me have a reason to be here? I can't talk to anyone about this stuff cause nobody understands, they'd all just think I'm pathetic. I just want someone to understand me, and someone who is able to relate to me.
-2	negative	suicide	I've been divorced for about 7months and separated for over 2years. I've been doing the online dating thing with no real luck. I'm so lonely and just want someone to snuggle with and talk to at night.  Where am I going wrong?
-4	negative	suicide	I've been in a bad relationship 4 a while then I finally decided to end it because that guy treated me lik trash n lik I didn't exist. Now I'm glad it's over but now I find it hard to trust anyone anymore in a relationship cause I'm scared of being hurt.
-1	negative	suicide	I've been looking at different ways to try and kill myself. I finally found one that I can will do. I want too, but I'm hesitant. I don't want to feel like this anymore..
-4	negative	suicide	I've been single my whole life, not because I wanted to but because no one has ever been interested in dating me. It's caused some really serious problems because not being able to date made me feel like I couldn't be friends with people who date. I've lost friends that way and now I feel like I won't ever date and I don't think I even want to anymore but I still don't think I can ever be friends with people who are dating or married.
-2	negative	suicide	I've been suicidal since I hit adolescence 6 years ago. Over the years I've tried a few time to end my existence but as you can see they've all ended in bitter disappointment. I feel stupid for saying this but does anyone have any helpful advice?
-5	negative	suicide	I've felt like doing it. Everyone's thought about it at least once.  No matter how terrible your life may seem right now, no one knows what the future holds. And your future is in your hands. 
-7	negative	suicide	I've learned that people have a very limited ability to stomach the reality of suicide. When I attempted it, I didn't just scratch my arm with a butter knife; I grabbed a box cutter and sliced myself up until the blade went dull, then I took it out and put in a clean one.  Unfortunately, the only cure for ignorance is experience. Until every moron out there is forced to see a member of their family being stitched back together in an emergency room by a nurse who is fighting back tears, people will never understand it. I'm not sure it is necessarily fair to expect them to. After all, when you are forced to confront the reality that you, too, can be driven to commit such an act of violence against yourself, the very foundation of your being is shaken. I'm not sure we'd be better off as a society of everyone was forced to go through such a thing.
-5	negative	suicide	I've made my mind up and I know what my choice is. No one is gonna stop me this time. October 18 will be the day. (:
-4	negative	suicide	I've never felt so unhappy in my life. I've never felt so hopeless. My number one wish right now is for it to all be over.
-3	negative	suicide	I've never wanted to kill myself more than I do now. Sitting here, on the verge of tears. I hurt the one person I loved most. What had my life come to? I was a fool, and in a group full of deadbeats and jerks I had been the cabaret act. I'd just be better off dead.
-2	negative	suicide	I've not seen a point been ready all my life to die, still waiting, that's all life is to me, waiting. I'm bored of waiting, so tired of waiting. 
-1	negative	suicide	I've overdosed more than five times this year, the most recent one was actually only a few days ago.  I don't exactly want to stop, but my friends are worried. 
-12	negative	suicide	Ive suffered with the effects of BPD for years without knowing what it was. Just recently got diagnosed and it all made sense to me why i am the way i am. More recently ive noticed that cannibis helps me to slow down my reaction time so that i dont reach angry and violent. I can focus on the emotion that triggers the anger and deal with that. I can also use humor and satire to ease the tension and relax, so i don't hurt the people in my life that i care about. I am a solid supporter of medicinal marijuana for BPD symptoms. But i still maintain an understanding that counselling and therapy (DBT) is a better way to get to the root of the problem. I am currently trying to find a doctor who can understand this and help me to get a medicinal user card in my area.
-5	negative	suicide	I've thought about overdosing before, but never brought myself to doing it. Does it hurt? I've heard it does. I never thought it would though, I though it would be like fainting. Where you go drowsy and just slowly fall asleep, but unlike fainting- you just won't wake up.
-3	negative	suicide	I've tried multiple times and been saved by multiple different people &lt;3 thanks to anyone who has helped me get thru my struggles. I am often selfish but people need to understand the hurt I go thru
-3	negative	suicide	I've tried several times, earlier this night. But I just wrote a poem, hopefully it helps.  Opening your eyes and hoping.
-13	negative	suicide	I've tried suicide many times but I hope this time I'll succeed. I took over three times the amount of Nyquil recommended and over 1200 milligrams of ibuprofen. If this doesn't work I don't know what I'll do. This is what everyone wants. For me to just disappear. They've made that clear. The people around me's words are clear. "Why don't you just kill yourself? Noboby'd miss you." Trust me I've been trying. The bulimia, the cutting, the pain just needs to end. I just can't help but feel selfish. Like I'm taking the easy way out. I'm not. There is no easy way out at this point. I can suffer and die a slow death here or do it now. I chose now. Is that so wrong? I just hope God can forgive me. I want to be a perfect Christian, a prefect daughter, a perfect sister, but I'm not. If I survive this I think I'm going to just listen to what God has to say to me because the only way I'm surviving this is by his grace.
-14	negative	suicide	I've tried to commit suicide 4 times. The first time being when I was around 14 and the last time being 8 months ago. I guess after being tossed away, betrayed, abused in countless ways, broken and made to believe i wasn't good enough, I developed a self hatred so deep that  i got tired of living and i would go to any extremes to just end the pain. Somedays I'm glad my attempts failed, other days I'd give anything to have just died. Suicide is still a thought that dances on my mind atleast a few times a day and I try my best to shake it, but sometimes I just wanna give in. I'm currently 2 months clean from self harm, a 3 year addiction that I'm trying my best to break. I guess you could say I'm getting better, but I'm still walking a tight rope, which I refuse to fall off of just yet.
-4	negative	suicide	I've tried to commit suicide twice, both in the same year, which was in 2013 though. Both in the month of November & I'm going strong. ;;;; I guess
-6	negative	suicide	I've tried to commit three times, the first a couple of years ago, the second and third were in the same week a couple of months ago. I don't remember much of the first but the second and third I had felt so much pain and I just wanted it all to stop and when they found out they were angry at me and said I was selfish but all I wanted to do was escape. If they felt the pain as I did, if they had my dark thoughts maybe they'd understand but I'd never wish that on anyone. And now there are times when I start feeling it again, when I feel like I'm trapped but I don't want to be a disappointment, I don't want them to be mad so I just suffer through it. All I have to show are this cuts here and there that show up but don't worry it's my way of coping, you should be happy I'm still here.
-1	negative	suicide	I've tried to kill myself twice - obviously failed both times.  It's almost been a yearand not a day goes by that I don't wish I hadn't woken up that fateful day.
-8	negative	suicide	I wanted to believe there was a reason I am here. My mother is mentally ill and should never have had me. She used very poor judgement when getting pregnant. She isn't able to see beyond what she wants in any given moment. She had a child with a very unstable man and no money. I truly believe I was not meant to born, I was not meant to be here. My life has been a tragic misfortune that should never have happened and I am painfully living out the results of that. 
-5	negative	suicide	I want to be honest with someone about everything. I want someone to love me and someone who wants to know my fears and strengths and everything. I want someone to ask me questions and really care about the answers
-2	negative	suicide	I want to die but don't want the responsibility of killing myself, the risk of pain or living through it even worse off. I fantasize about dying and the disappearance of my consciousness. It's a slow release and a drift. It seems so easy and worthwhile. I only I could just fall asleep forever, it would be like slipping away for good.
-1	negative	suicide	I want to die in my sleep, tonight. Good nite {{fingers crossed}}
-3	negative	suicide	I want to die. I want it so bad.  Why can't I be happy. Why can't I be normal???
-3	negative	suicide	I want to fade into nothingness. I want to feel the bliss of sleep for eternity. I don't want to die. Dying means feeling nothing. In which case I'm already dead. I want to feel the false security of someone I love wrapping their arms around me while I sleep. Someone who I love yet can't be with.
-3	negative	suicide	I want to find someone interested in a real, long-term relationship with honesty, respect and openness. I believe that it's a man's duty to take care of his lady, protect her and support her and I want to find someone I can give my love to.
-4	negative	suicide	I want to have hands intertwined with mine, I want to kiss and be kissed, I want to be held and to hold, I want to caress and be caressed
-10	negative	suicide	i was a freshman im highschool and i had no friends or boyfriends bc i was super shy and had anxiety alot of it so people thought i was really weird. they would not talk to me at all. i started failing my classes and i was a nobody so i went home and took 13 pills of exedrin and ended up throwing up all night and told my mom and she took me to the hospital i ended up in the mental hospital after that not fun !
-10	negative	suicide	I was bullied from starting primary up until now I got teachers involved but they did nothing! So I thought the only way I could release pain was to commit suicide it failed 4 times! So from that last day trying I thought to myself. There must be a reason why god won't take me? And now I love to find out that reason . Ps, I'm always here to help x
-4	negative	suicide	I WAS dead I WAS. No heart beat, no respiration. But they revived me. Took them almost 3 hours to stabilize me for transport. I woke 3 days later handcuffed to the bed in a hospital on suicide watch. I was not left alone for over a week. Not even to use the bathroom or take a shower. And all other times I was handcuffed to the bed with pressure cuffs on my legs to stop blood clots.
-3	negative	suicide	I was forced between a rock and a hard place and was made to give up my two dogs, Charlie my beatuiful boy and Lily Rose my little girl.  It's been a year this month that I watched my heart leave my body and them go to their new home.  Although they are happy, i truly feel like my life is missing something so significant and the fact they are now threapy dogs does nothing to console my grieving soul.  I feel like a dead person!  My babies the kids I will never have, my very existance is torment.  They are making people happy but I'm quietly dying inside and have to hide it and pretend everything is normal.  
-4	negative	suicide	I was going through a car wash last night and was thinking how cute it'd be to make out in one. Like when the soap covers the whole car and no one can see you.
-4	negative	suicide	I was hurt after coming out of the closet. Beaten and insulted, went home, got the belt, wussed out. Happened a few times. I gave up and made friends. I'm better but still feel it from time to time.
-2	negative	suicide	i was in a relationship for 2 whole years with someone who made me feel like i would never be enough for anything. they constantly told me how i was ugly, how i would never find anyone else, that nobody else would ever love me. they told me they hated me, that i wasn't good enough for them, they even told me to kill myself. after hearing it for so long, you start to believe it. they would purposely flirt with other girls infront of me just to hurt me. they would cheat on me, and when i found out about it, say "it's your fault". they would sit there and watch me cry and beg them to stop because i loved them so much, and they would just continue to hurt me, i guess bringing me down gave them some kind of high. 
-6	negative	suicide	I was with the wrong person for 5 odd years. I realised that it wasn't working near the end of the relationship but I was scared of being alone. I realised that it was holding us both back. So we went our separate ways.
-5	negative	suicide	I wish I could kill myself without consequence. I don't care about getting better in this life, I don't want it, wish I never had it, so my family would have no one to grieve. I truly wish I never existed, not in this world. I know committing suicide would hurt my family so I won't, but living for others isn't as fulfilling as it sounds. I try to focus on giving back through volunteering but it still feels meaningless. I just wish I could leave without going against God or upsetting my family. But when you're dead you're not there to see the aftermath it causes, but I still don't want to hurt them. Or for my family to be looked upon with pity every time someone realizes what happened. I just wish I could opt out of having to be here.
-3	negative	suicide	I wonder how many people would care if i killed myself right now
-4	negative	suicide	I wonder how my poor liver is doing some days I wonder how my brain is working. Some days I'm sober but life isn't a reality and I see things. My poor little fragile body.
-2	negative	suicide	I wonder what happens after, I wonder when I will die. How will I die? Would anyone care or notice? How important am I to people? How soon will people move on?
-2	negative	suicide	I wrote this earlier today. I lie in bed, waiting to decide. wondering what action to take. Here's what I wrote: 
-2	negative	suicide	January 5th, 2014: im sorry i failed im sorry i scared im sorry you know me, if i attempt again, hopefully ill succeed this time..
-2	negative	suicide	Just been thinking another Christmas without him. He used to run and play in the wrapping paper after the gifts were opened. And all the chicken wings from Timmy Chan's .. nothing to do but throw the bones away. And all these half filled water bottles stacking up in my room.. theres no doggy bowl to pour them in. Idk.. I just miss him.
-1	negative	suicide	Kill Me Job: Requirements: get the job done the first time.
-9	negative	suicide	Last week I took about 40 various pills in hopes to kill myself but I dozed off and woke up throwing up everywhere. I told my family I ate something bad and it must have made me sick. I only told 2 people what really happened but they seem to think it was by accident and I didn't want to die. I'll just let them think that but they are in for a big surprise..
-4	negative	suicide	Last year I spent a week with my brother, while my mother was in the hospital. It was kind of a weird time. We hadn't really gotten along in a long time.  My mother was so sick the Drs wouldn't let me tell her until almost 2 weeks later. 
-4	negative	suicide	Last year my husband told me he was going to divorce me, completely out of the blue. I ended completely losing it and being admitted to a psych unit. Twice. I hadn't been diagnosed with anything before that point, and it found out that I have severe recurrent depression, anxiety, and what my psychiatrist called chronic suicidal thoughts. My ex comments that I never say that I'm glad I didn't die and that it worries him. Well, here's the thing, I'm not glad I didn't die. I wish I had just fallen asleep and left all this pain behind. Sometimes I feel like I can't do anything right. I really don't want to be this way, but it just never ends. I just hate my life.
-7	negative	suicide	Less then a month ago I tried to commit suicide. I felt that there was no way out and that nobody cared. And to be honest I still feel that way sometimes but it does get better. I know everyone says it and most of them haven't experienced it but I have. Things will and do get better I promise. I'm always here if you need someone to chat with  I don't judge
-3	negative	suicide	Life has no meaning. We are a pointless race of bigoted, greedy and manipulative fools who strive so hard to achieve nothing. The biggest sin of them all is to bring more life into the world; to allow another poor soul to be subjected to the mindless stupidity and cruelty of mankind, and to contribute to it. We are afraid of death, when really we should be afraid of life. Our very existence is a joke.
-2	negative	suicide	Life seems filled with only pain & suffering all i ever do is remember is the times people or family hurt me. Lies about things will get better & time heals its BS.Suicide is the answer being on disability i need to find a quick cheap way to kill myself. Please no crap about god cause i dont believe 
-2	negative	suicide	Like the strings of a violin plucked by the hands of the musician, my heart still resonates though the musician had since moved on
-4	negative	suicide	Lol. This group makes me laugh. Don't get me wrong, I kinda agree. There really is something to be said about the sexiness of proper grammatical constructions.
-3	negative	suicide	Look where I am now, I say my past won't define me In the same bed I was in, so I threw on my minds bottle cap.
-3	negative	suicide	Love at First Sight Then someone else walks into the room and you'd think"forget this other joker.my god, this is my real soul mate!" 
-3	negative	suicide	Loving him was like trying to change your mind once you are already flying through the free fallMemorizing him was as easy as remembering every word of your favorite song.

-20	negative	suicide	Me and my brother are 4 years apart, we weren't always the best of friends but I always looked up to him.  He was a great friend, always so full of lifeI'm not sure what happend. Just days after my brothers birthday he hung himself. He had a family, a job, friends, and no signs of depression. But when my brother drank it was a different story. 08/04/13 was one of those nights, he had been drinking and celebrating is birthday. He walked to the park and hung himself by a swing. I try so hard to understand what he was going through but its so hard. This will be our first holiday with out him and I'm trying to be strong, Thanksgiving just passed and it wasnt the same it was so hard to be thankful when a huge part of my life was missing, I have a million feelings but I constantly have to stay strong because I have a family of my own who needs me. I wish you were still here big bro!! 
-16	negative	suicide	My 89 year old father passed away on the 6th of September..I can not think of him without tears forming in my eyes.. I loved him so much, he was a wonderful husband to my mother and father to my brothers and I. I feel blessed that we had him with us this long. Anyway, my mother use to tell us the story that she used to work in a drive in restaurant in the 40's as a "carhop" My dad who was in the Navy stopped by and left her a penny tip. He later would tell us that was all he had. I talked to my mother this evening, she is very distraught with missing him. She said that he has come by to see her. He has turned the light on next to her chair when she comes in the house after being away. Today, she found a penny in her bed..Truly, a penny from Heaven for my mother, from the man she loved for 67 years. thank you God for your blessings and for my father's unending love.
-7	negative	suicide	My BFF of 18 years is the only one who truly knows me. She can simply tell by the ex This world is so complex that I wonder where that one person that I can spend the rest of my life with who will know me, accept me for me, love me for me and be accepting of my boys!!

-11	negative	suicide	my cat Cutu was 8 years old. she was my everything. i never knew how painful losing your best friend would be, until 3 months ago.  i still have such insane guilt. my family thinks im over it but i still cry myself to sleep. i still have super bad days where i just sit and stare and imagine if i didnt feed her that morning, she would still be beside me. i would always say "if she died i dont know what i would do" i really have no idea what to do. im sad, lonley, and feel that if i tell someone all they would do is not care or just give me the "shes much happier up there" when really i pray to god she is because thats whats holding me up. all my friends dont care. i also dont want them to worry. and my family thinks everythings all peachy when really i feel like *. i just hope everything will be ok eventually. 
-1	negative	suicide	My cat just passed away last night, RIP Smokey 
-3	negative	suicide	My dad died a few days ago. I don't have enough money to go back home and go to his funeral. The day that he died, i cried all night. The next day I was so numb.  I feel empty. That is everything I feel. I am a looser that needs to be put down!
-9	negative	suicide	My dad passed away 11 years ago when I was only 9 years old.  At weird times when I'm either thinking about him or stressed out I'll find pennies in the strangest places.  This morning on the way to take my GRE test for graduate school, I said some prayers and asked my dad to help me have confidence in myself during the test. At the testing center, they give you a locker to put your belongings in. Upon opening mine, I found a penny heads up right in the door of the locker.  Unlike my mother, I have always been skeptical about "pennies from heaven". But this morning after finding my penny from my dad, I found confidence in myself for my test just as I asked him and confidence in the pennies I find truly being from heaven.    
-2	negative	suicide	My Dad: You know Honey boo boo has a boyfriend Why don't you?  Oh the joys of being single. XD
-1	negative	suicide	My ex left me for another girl. I'm in so much pain, he was so much of my life, nothing seems enjoyable or worth it anymore. It's been months and I still feel like life is pointless and I'll never be happy.
-11	negative	suicide	My first attempt was when I was eleven. I tried hanging myself. Too heavy, even though I was a little pile of bones suffering from anorexia at the time. Second time was around 13. I cut my thighs open. But. I was too scared. So now I just have ugly scars. Third and fourth time was in the last six months. I tried to hang myself and over dose on Xanax, but. I was always too scared. I didn't know why and hated that I couldn't even kill myself. But. Now I realize that I was meant to live. All those times I failed wasn't accidental. I need to live to have a future. To find a day where waking up isn't a struggle and I no longer hate myself. I haven't found  that day just yet, but it will come one day. I know it will.
-5	negative	suicide	My First True Love He passed eight years ago. And since then life has been a very hard place to navigate. But I do ok because of all he has taught me. No man before or since has shown me a more pure love. So I thank him for teaching me the love I should be looking for. 
-21	negative	suicide	My friends joke about suicide nearly everyday. They have no idea what goes on in my head. How many times I've tried to end it. They don't see the scars that run up my wrist, I smile, to keep them smiling. The one friend I had the guts to tell, told people. It eventually died down when I laughed it off and made them all stop believing what they don't hear from the person they're laughing at. I come home, I cry, I go back down and pretend nothing's wrong. I want them to believe that suicide is no joke. It takes a lot for mental pain to turn into physical pain. Let alone letting the physical pain effect you mentally again, no one deserves the feeling that they're not good enough, because they are. So are you. Just believe in yourself.
-5	negative	suicide	My husband died Dec 8 2013 after fighting cancer for 6 years.  Over the last year he was nice to everyone but me.  We were together 20 years married for 14 of that. We have a 11 year old son.   I keep finding things that are hurtful. Found out he gave assets away notes in his truck.  People keep telling me things he said that were good about me.  I try to believe them but why could he not tell those things to me.   I  am so lonely and hurt that he could not have told me he loved me before he died.  Not the same coming from others 
-23	negative	suicide	My husband is addicted to pain pills. He sometimes will take up to 20 or more a day. He sometimes snorts them or eats them crushed to get in his system faster. It started out for pain but i think he likes the high more than needed for pain. He is spending up around 500.00 or more a month on getting more than his prescripton. He doesnt work and now is so depressed that he doesnt do anything but lay around. Im not sure if the depression is from all the pills or that not having enough. I have helped him get more for so long out of guilt. I didnt want him to be in pain plus he makes me believe he hates me or its my fault. Finally i took all the money we have left and hid it. He just went thru 90 in 4 days and now has none. I refuse to get him more this time. He says he is just going to go thru the withdrawls until he can get more. I want to call his doc but im afraid of what will happen. This is way out of control.
-6	negative	suicide	My life had been falling apart since 1997. Things were falling to pieces. Worst of all my family was leaving me one by one. My uncle in 1999. My father in 2003. My aunt on 2005. My other uncle on 2006. And finally my mom in 2009. I am the only one left. All are in linden hill cemetery. I just don't see any point in living. My life is going into the street. I can't find work I can't get public assistance. I have no place to live. And I'd rather i decide when to die than be stabbed in a New York shelter buy someone who wants my coat and leaves me bleeding to death on the floor.
-2	negative	suicide	My life is horrible right now and nothing is going right. I just got diagnosed with depression and anxiety, I throw up all the time, my ex-boyfriend is now dating someone else, and I just found out I will need to repeat classes I didn't pass but need for my challenging major at a really good school. I wonder if I'll ever be happy. I look at everyone else's lives and their perfect relationships and honestly hate myself and don't even want to be here anymore. I just want things to get better. 
-9	negative	suicide	My life was practly perfect till my dad died about 2 years ago. since then My mom hasn't really talked to me only to yell at me and put me down. I hate my life she claims i am the abusive one but really I have never even talked back or told her to shut the f*$k up. I am 15 and trapped in a world of lies I am sick of it but around others she is the picture perfect mom only coming across and mildly irriated with me. So I have no one and all I want is my daddy back.
-2	negative	suicide	My little angel has passed away this morningShe suffered from A.A Subluxation which was a very rare case in cats. I am devastated, our family decided that it was time for us to let go and not let her suffer any longer as her heart could not tolerate anymore medication   January 28th, 2009 - May 21st, 2013  
-4	negative	suicide	My love lives in another country. When we wake up together she curls here lithe body around me like a pretzel and holds me tight. She treats my ears as some edible object and would devour me if I had any chance of regenerating body parts. ;I  miss her ..
-2	negative	suicide	My mental issues are causing me to go out of control.  
-7	negative	suicide	My mind works in such a weird way, I know that my bf (well ex now) is leaving for work tomorrow and all I keep thinking of is the 3 boxes of sleeping pills and 2 bottles of barcardi I have hidden away.  I keep thinking I should write a letter or something, do laundry, clean up, make phone call's, etc..  It is all planned out, and I am prepared in 1 sense but feel like there are little things I should do so people won't be left with too many what ifs and the housework is so no one would really have to clean up after me.   
-9	negative	suicide	My mom is in ICU and I got my heart, not broken, but shredded tonight. I was dumb enough to fall deeply for someone prematurely, yet again. I did that years ago! Sick! I knew him less than 2 months maybe, and it already felt like I was in love with him. It's all over now. He expressed what I took as no reguard to whether myself or my mom lives or dies. What if I'd actually lost my virginity to someone heartless enough to come at me at a time like this? An example that men like my exes still exist and I need to be wary of them. I don't want someone who can't be real.
-9	negative	suicide	My mom just told me a couple of days ago. He was my cousin. She told me how it happened and for a while I couldnt get the visual out of my head. I kept imagining what his last moments must have been like. I don't like to think about it. His memorial is in a few days and I'll be going. In my life I've been to alot of funerals and memorials and I don't think I cried at any of them, but I'm very sure I will at this one. It literally stings to think that he's gone. And it's strange because I didn't even know him that well. I didn't see him often, not even yearly, but when i did see him i immediately loved him. I think it hurts more because of the fact that he died by his own hand and not by something like cancer or old age or even a gun shot. Why does suicide sting so much more ?
-9	negative	suicide	My name is Theo. I'm a 13 year old genderfluid suicidal person. My life isn't that bad at home; no serious abuse, just some spankings and yelling. I've been depressed as long as I can remember, as well as scratching, burning, and cutting myself. I have a brother (Jake) and my parents. I do not believe that they are my real parents because I don't think a real parent would make their child want to kill themselves and tell everyone about every hospitalization they've had and why. I don't believe that they would make that child feel worse by yelling at them about getting a D on a quiz. I don't think that they would ban the things that save them because they're 'promoting violence' or 'just yelling' or 'going to make you fall into your fantasy world again.'. I don't believe that they would scream at them because of a napkin that missed the trash or to 'change so the people don't tease you'.  Sorry for my rant, but I had to get it out.
-2	negative	suicide	My parakeet name Lea died because I play too rough. I loved her soooo much. I wish I can have her back. Also she was the so nice and pretty. Can anyone post a cheap bird trainer so my other birds can be nice as Lea
-6	negative	suicide	My Story   the reason I have depression is cuz I have PTSD for those who don't know what that is its Post Tramaic Stress Disordor. I got while I was im the army in Iraq back in 2004. the stuff I seen there would make your head turn. that ii have it 
-1	negative	suicide	Never again! It only makes me weaker
-4	negative	suicide	No one needs me here. Not even those closest to me. Why would they? Who would want or need me around? I don't smell good. I look like a monster. No one likes me. You can do anything to me. I'm not smart. I'm none as the one who just sits up and talks crazy or about things no one knows what I'm talking about. When I do talk, the only thing people listen for is what off the wall crazy thing will I say. I don't understand life or anything the way most people do. 
-4	negative	suicide	not in a despressed/sucidal way. im genuinely wondering what is the point? what am i contributing that is so important that i need to live? it would not effect anyone if i was dead so im curious. i dont really do anything or have any talents??? so i dont understand why im even living????? like why?
-10	negative	suicide	Not true. When I was living with my biological parents (RIP and Janet) they were crackheads. (Genius crackheads, but being a genius doesn't change that fact) When the CIA (I think that's what they are called) came to take me away from my house, they found me sitting in the front hallway eating a muffin. I was undernourished and that muffin was the only piece of food in the house. They couldn't even find a crumb. The CIA suspect that there is no way I was in that household without being addicted. I think they are wrong, but hey who knows? Anyways I've never tried drugs after being put into a foster home and I never plan on it. So yeah =D
-13	negative	suicide	Okay, I am 17 years old and I have just finished my first year of sixth form. (High School), the whole first year was terrible for me as many bad things happened and in the end I achieved low grades as I expected and my initial reaction was 'Okay, I'm going to come back from this, just stay positive and retake those exams. It might be hard but I have to do this!' but in a later interview with the sixth form, they revealed that my grades and attendance were poor and I wasn't allowed back for the second year. Although this is disheartening, I felt it would be stupid to worry and panic because that doesn't help at all. (I recognized I have sounded a bit big headed in this post at times and I am sorry for that, but I'm trying my best to be brutally honest)
-8	negative	suicide	Okay, so a friend of mine suggested me to see a therapist, and I did. He prescribed me some anti-depressants and those meds just have this weird sleeping effect. I have been sleeping since last 3 days and my mind is just blank. I am discontinuing the meds as they are not helping me out anymore. I feel more depressed. I am no happy from inside. I am dying each day, I don't have words to express how am I feeling right now . God Bless You All !!
-16	negative	suicide	Okay so I'm really sorry for not shutting up about this but if you read my older experiences it will make more sense! So basically I met this guy and I adored him and we had been talking for a while but he made up an excuse and then said that he was lying he just didn't want to talk for a bit because his mother had sadly passed away. I understood and have just messaged him about once a day just saying hey or asking if he was alright up until today. The last thing he said to me was"I'm sorry I'm trying so hard" and he said that 2 weeks ago. I really do/did like him but I know I have to just forget about him now. He obviously just doesn't want to talk to me, but it is hard. I shared everything with him and he was my first proper love(
-11	negative	suicide	Ok so I been looking for someone to talk to, glad I found this site. My husband passed away exactly a month ago. He had a heart attack out of nowhere right in front of me. Me and my children performed CPR till paramedics arrived. He was only 48 I'm 41 and we were married 16 years.All of a sudden I have a huge desire to live and do all the things I ever wanted to do. I paid to go on a hot air balloon ride,,,I'm planning a vacation this summer (my first ever) My husband never wanted to go anywhere so I didn't either. But I've realized that life is just too short. I miss him so much though and think of him every day all day.
-5	negative	suicide	Once you know the real me then hopefully we can become friends or enemies, whatever the result is. Just please know and accept me for who I am.
-1	negative	suicide	One day will find the man of my dreams.   And have a lot of fun walking down the Lane called Life!  &lt;3
-2	negative	suicide	One day, you will feel like a loser. Not any type of loser, but the one who lost it all. Maybe I am still that loser- that failure. But I just dont want to be the failure, loser AND quitter. Two is enough.
-5	negative	suicide	One of the hardest things to deal with when trying to overcome panic and anxiety is knowing what to do with all that excess energy. I know when I used to get my panic attacks it sometimes felt like I just wanted to jump right out of my skin! My heart would race at a thousand beats per minute and I thought one day it just might literally shoot out of my chest. Of course my hypochondria only made it worse because I was convinced I could have a heart attack at any moment. 
-14	negative	suicide	One phone call took everything I had away from me. I thought everything was alright until I got that one phone call and ever since that one phone call every single night I have prayed to stop breathing in my sleep so I would not have to wake up and deal with the pain, disappointment, hurt, or lonlyness anymore but every morning I continue to wake up. Why me? What did I do to deserve this? They say time heals all wunds but the pain just gets worse everyday, and everyday feels like I just got the phone call. I am alone inside and out and it would be better for me if I just wasent here anymore.
-9	negative	suicide	One year ago from today I tried to commit suicide. Life was to hard and I had too many things on my shoulders. I cut my myself every where along my body to try to bleed out. Then after it didn't work I overdosed. I shouldn't be here today but I am. As a christian I know your not supposed to doubt or question God but I wish he would have let me die.  Life is still miserable for me and the pain caused  by people I thought could trust is unbearable. But I'm still ok and I hope I will see better days soon
-10	negative	suicide	On the 26th of November I attempted suicide by overdose. This was the 3rd time I attempted it. After staying in the Hospital for a few days and having the Crisis Team follow my every move, my body eventually recovered. My roommate contacted a friend to come with her to the hospital because you need two people  to identify the body if it is a suicide. They saw me in a terrible state, and I will always remember the look on their faces when I woke up. Nearly a month on and I'm still trying to work out if I'm happy I survived.
-12	negative	suicide	On this day, one year ago I attempted suicide by overdose and never really forgiven myself. All I remember is fighting on the phone with my mother, hanged up and cried pacing back and forth. I went upstairs to the medicine drawer and took whatever I could find. Woke up to a blur of hearing my boyfriend screaming my name then passed out again. I was in the hospital for two weeks and therapy for the next three months. I will forever be grateful of how my boyfriend saved my life. If he didn't find me when he did, I wouldn't have lived to this day to see the chances and opportunities I have been given the past year. Life gets better, I promise.
-1	negative	suicide	 No one understands. It's nice to know I'm not the only one. 
-2	negative	suicide	reading and writing stuff on a random website can only help in certain ways in certain circumstances . . .I feel MORE overwhelmed when I see all this grief and pain than when I was alone!  Keep your options open . . .
-1	negative	suicide	Seems like I will never find true love. There is someone out there for me.
-2	negative	suicide	Several times actually, unfortunately I've never succeeded;I will succeed soon
-3	negative	suicide	She may never know how deeply I'm I'm love with her and how much I wish she was mine. All I can do is dream about her. Dreaming about her is the closes ill ever be in loving her and that hurts.
-5	negative	suicide	She paints a pretty picture, but the story has a twist.  You see her mind was her razor, and her heart was her wrist.
-4	negative	suicide	"She's single because she refuses to change her relationship status for someone who falls short for what she deserves. Knowing her self value, she's chosen to preserve a spot in her heart for a real man, someone mature enough to understand that loyalty, commitment, and honesty is a priority and not an option" A reminder.  I so love this
-12	negative	suicide	S, my very best friend and my would be girlfriend in the weeks to follow, came to my house. We laid in my bed room and we smoked two good bowls out of her pipe. I remember looking at her and really wanting to kiss her. Everything looked fake, as if the entire world was a doll house and I was a test subject. Later, I dozed off beside her on the couch. I don't know if it was that moment that we decided we should be together, but we have since enjoyed smoking together almost daily. I do believe that it helps our relationship a lot.
-12	negative	suicide	So, a couple years ago I was in sixth grade. I was getting bullied and I just wanted to die, so one night when I was laying on my bed crying, I decided to try to kill myself. I took the knife I had hid in my room and slit my wrist hoping to bleed out Let me tell you that didn't happen. The guy that I liked and still like today called my grandmother and told her everything, I was taken to the hospital and he was there. Today there is no physical scar just the mental scar that will never go away.
-11	negative	suicide	So, basically, there was a guy who I really liked a year and a half ago, we had both experienced break ups & ended up sleeping together. Then it got complicated Or talk to me. I get so angry (to the point if shaking) that I want to slap him or give him a piece of my mind or something, but then the last time I saw him (which was a few weeks ago) I blushed and started giggling, yet when he clocked me, he spent the rest of the time giving me evils. I mean Wtf?! It winds me up that he can't even be civil and, quite frankly, i do regret it as we got on well prior to sleeping together.
-12	negative	suicide	So I decided to not buy weed after a long debilitation with myself, having a stack of reasons too. I went to a club an took some class a's and drank and them after was like a recovery period after which I was not going to purchase any more of my favriout drug of choice marajawana. I lasted just less than 48hrs. Call it want u want, I know that addiction is cunning and there were a series of processes but in the end I was already doing it. That's powerlessness. I will try agen but first let me just finish this weed
-9	negative	suicide	So I'm at the beach with a friend. He doesn't smoke weed that much, I smoke weed every day. And it made me realize my tolerance level. I light the bowl take a few hits, pass it he takes 3 hits and passes out and wakes up high the next day, I barely got a buzz..
-2	negative	suicide	So im hoping to loose some weight and build some muscle, I say hoping because im completely useless at selfmotivating!  so hit me up if you could use a new friend and a diet/exercise buddy!!
-6	negative	suicide	So it's been 3 months he's been away in rehab already I'm so proud of him, he sounds and looks so good! But the nights are getting harder and harder  missing him grows more and more, I know I need to be strong for the both of us, && I am trying so hard! But it's killing me tonight.. I want my boyfriend back home  I want our happy family again.. For all of us men and women out there supporting our addicts in their road to recovery, keep your heads up.. It's can't rain forever.. One day at a time right..
-10	negative	suicide	So last year I started self harming after a number of events and gradually became an addict. Those of you who are familiar with self harm know how extremely addictive it is when you start and when you want to stop, it's really hard. I managed to stop once but only for a few weeks and started doing it again but not as much as I had before. Then I stopped again. But last night, my progress was ruined. I started doing it again but worse that it used to be. It seems like things are different now because deep down, I'm ashamed of it, when I used to be proud of it. Proud that I was still here despite everything. I guess I'm just ashamed because I'm a victim of addiction. JJ xx
-14	negative	suicide	Someone asked me the other day about my pet peeves Well here you have it. One of the few things that makes me very angry very quickly is when a persons refers to suicide as if it is no big deal.  No. No no no on SO many levels this is not ok!! I take myself to be a fairly tolerant person; just last night I was chatting with some random guy who was shopping online for girls panties- whatever floats your boat! But I have lost too many family members and considered it too many times myself to discus suicide in anything less than a serious context.
-1	negative	suicide	someone needs to do a mass suicide or someone can kill me
-2	negative	suicide	Someone, please enlighten me; because I have no idea  why.
-2	negative	suicide	Someone who I can be affectionate with in public and alone, someone I can talk with. Someone I can simply TRUST. I've been single for awhile now, and just seem to be surrounded by happy relationships, while I'm stuck being lonelyI'm so tired of being alone in a crowd
-6	negative	suicide	Something I thought I would post up until now.  I did try to commit suicide many times.  It's really hard to go through with it.  I tried jumping off a roof, cutting myself, and a few times put a gun to my head.  Somehow, I manage to stop myself from going through with it. I hope that I can manage it, but everything isn't good right now.
-1	negative	suicide	Sometimes a pet from your hand or just sitting really close to you will be nice mom. Nice mom. Do you know? Keep reading your ipad and whatsapp.
-1	negative	suicide	Sometimes I feel like I am not sick enough. Sure, I am depressed and I'm being treated with medicine, but I still feel like no one takes this seriously. I'm sorry.
-9	negative	suicide	Sometimes I feel like I am the only one who can see the truth behind life and it scares me. I see people worrying about school, relationships, and other problems and I'm jealous of them. Why cant I just worry about normal stuff? Why don't they see how pointless everything is? That we grow up, get an education, work, retire and die plain and simple. Life is just a cruel joke to me I want to leave, to finally escape. I feel trapped, everyday going through the same routines of life. I constantly have suicidal thoughts.. but I am too much of a coward to go through with anything. I just want to go peacefully.. from what I have heard about overdose a lot can go wrong and it can be painful, not to mention I hate pills and avoid taking them even when I'm extremely sick. I'd hang myself but I'm useless at doing anything right so I would probably end up messing that up some how. I can't take it anymore I just want to die.
-4	negative	suicide	Sometimes you think your friends and their hugs will fix anything but I get tired if being lonely even if I have all these friends . I want that one person to hug me, love me and show affection towards me. I act like I can live without a boyfriend or a partner but inside I know I need one to fix this part of my heart of mine that no friend can fix .
-7	negative	suicide	Soo, i just finished my last cigaret and it's only 10:00am, this morning i had half a pack left. it worries me to smoke so much because i dont want cancer. I went running at my gym though and that seemed to be good for my lungs
-11	negative	suicide	So on the 20th of this month (October 201 Marks 3 months since found my Angel passed away in her crib. She was a week shy of being 7 months old. Worst part is I have no closure Autopsy showed NOTHING even SIDS ruled out. I tried counseling church meds EVERYTHING & NOTHING has helped. Im just a shell for inside I too died that day. At this point I just want to go fast & easy. Looking for suggestions. My mind made up!
-1	negative	suicide	Spread my arms floating down river singing "whole lotta love" then peacefully cease to exist 
-5	negative	suicide	Suicide, yes. Only thinking about it makes me smile, suicide to me is kind of the captain of the football team and i'm kind of  the new girl, once i had a taste of him, and now i can't stop wishing i could be in his arms, oh suicide. Take all this pain away. Date me.
-13	negative	suicide	Thank you all for the kind words relating to the loss of my best friend this morning. Those were the best 9 years of my life and I would never trade them. I'm so grateful my baby girl was placed into my life. She watched me grow from a little 9 year old to an 18 year old college student and never left my side once. She loved me even when I felt that no one else did. I am truly blessed to have had this wonderful baby girl in my life. I love you Penny so much. You were the best dog anyone could have. you lived a long good life and now after catering to me and always loving me and being there it's your time to rest. I love you my sweet baby girl. Always and forever.
-15	negative	suicide	That feeling when everything was going perfect then it kicks in. Nobody cares Nobody know how sad You are. Nobody is their for you. All I need is for people to care. I want HIM to care. He thinks im fine. He even knows about the cuts but he doesnt care. Nobody does. If i go now maybe they might notice how unhappy I am.  
-1	negative	suicide	Thats my dog name .She was a street dog and we took her in clean her up and made friends.I miss her the day she pass away i was not home my brother in law ran over her a night .He didnot see her .They try to get her away but i did not see her the next morning .So my daddy told me what had happen.I still miss her she was a good dog
-4	negative	suicide	The awful moment when you realize that no one you know will actually care if you commit suicide
-21	negative	suicide	The first time I tried to commit suicide was when my family was out to dinner and left me at home. I took a steak knife out of the kitchen drawer and I slit my wrists, I cut my thighs, I cut my neck. I was covered in blood and I was in pain. If I'm being honest, I was scared like I think most people are when they try to commit suicide. My family got home and saw me lying there, my mom and my little brother noticed the blood and ran to me but my older sister ran out of the house saying how much she hated how dramatic out family is. If only she knew that the only reason I haven't done it yet is because I don't want my family to be sad. I don't anyone to have to find me.
-1	negative	suicide	The Hardest Thing I Ever Had To Do. 
-10	negative	suicide	The lesson u will learn from "THE FIFTH MOUNTAIN" book that i have read (By paulo choelho) : i hope that really helped guys , thanks for reading this. I told myself first what u have read before telling it to u i swear, it isn't an inspirational talking that can't be applied or a piece of bla bla bla that we hear on the TV, it is really what i get benefited from in my life and gonna do. 
-4	negative	suicide	There are so much things that I hold on to myself that theyre slowly killing me inside. I have been lonely pretty much lonely most of my life and I cant find anyone who I am comfortable enough to talk to and share my thoughts and feelings with. I kept holding onto these thoughts and feeling myself and they build up inside me to the point where sometimes I feel like Im gonna have a breakdown. I cant do this anymore. I feel so sick and tired. I have to let it all out.  I cant open myself up. Im afraid to. My thoughts and feelings keep piling up inside me. They became a heavy burden in my heart. My heart aches with all these burdens. I dont want to carry them anymore. I just want to let it all out..
-6	negative	suicide	There is a girl at my school whose mom ha pancreatic cancer. She died Friday night and I am really struggling with it. I have a class with the girl but I don't particularly like her, or know her but my grief for her is overwhelming. I cannot possibly imagine how upside down your life must be after an event like that. How do you move forward knowing nothing will ever be the same?
-1	negative	suicide	There's just too much that time cannot erase 
-3	negative	suicide	there was a time when I hated the cigarette n smokers . 
-15	negative	suicide	These past few months have been horrible, people all around me have been committing suicide. I never knew a single one if them but to here what they did, breaks my heart. No one is ever alone. You may think that you are but once your gone, you'll actually see who cares, but that will be too late. If your ever thinking to cut yourself or end it, think again. It might put you out of your misery, but it will hurt the people around you.  My story is true. This just shows that people are looks out for you even though they aren't  your friends. If anyone ever needs to talk, I'm always here 
-2	negative	suicide	The voices are getting louder. But can I get away quick enough?
-1	negative	suicide	They have been there off and on for about 6years now. I've attempted 5 times, tonight I'm thinking about planing number 6.. I don't want to make it to my birthday(it's a few weekend from now). It would be for the best. Nobody will miss me, so I wouldn't feel guilty about leaving anyone. I just can't see my future anymore. Not without her..
-1	negative	suicide	Think in going to end my life I can't take this anymore it's too much a burden
-4	negative	suicide	This is my first post here, and I know this isn't a dating site, so I'm sorry if this is the wrong place to talk about it. 
-7	negative	suicide	This is my perspective alone.  I've thought about suicide many, many times. It's a recurring theme in my life. Even so, I have not tried and only came close once.It won't solve the pain you--or I--have endured. But living well, dissolving their power over you, is a very good revenge. I know this from experience.
-10	negative	suicide	This is something that I made on a note card about the issue or urges of suicide and self-harm. I GET IT about wanting to kill yourself I have had thoughts of suicide since I was 12 and I'm 38 now.  Try this who is in control at this stage us our or mind, do we have these thoughts and does it stress people out, yes, but just because we think something like this they are not facts.
-2	negative	suicide	Those 5 years at school were some if the worst. But its been 3 years so I guess I am moving on
-5	negative	suicide	Those scars on my wrist will never go away, I love them. they tell a story and my story is your typical cliche, but what happens when that story inspires me to try again?
-18	negative	suicide	Today is the day she told me she was leaving me. After 3 years of being together she just told me it was over. Telling me that there's just no spark in our relationship but I could clearly tell that she was in love with someone else. For months she seemed distant herself, when I kissed her I could tell that she wasn't into it, and at night she wouldn't even let me touch her let alone cuddle. Our relationship was dying but I held in there because I loved her. Her happiness means everything to me. And if she's happy with someone else then I guess I just have to accept that and be happy for her even if it hurts me. I hope that in time my heart will heal.
-6	negative	suicide	today is the day that i say goodbye. i've had enough and so have my friends and family. it's time that i say good bye and time for people to stop worrying or having to deal with me. good bye
-14	negative	suicide	Today I went to a fancy pizza place with my mom, aunt and cousin. We ordered 2 medium deep dish pizzas and our waiter said it would take 30 minutes so we ordered some cheese bread and I got a salad. My salad came right away and I ate it quick then the cheese bread came and I ate a whole tray, my family commented on how much I was eating, my aunt was encouraging me to eat the whole thing
-3	negative	suicide	Today, my flight take off for LV for 3 weeks. Was left alone here and joining her in next 3 weeks. Usually she is away by my side not more than 3 days. Now at least 21 days. I guess I am the kind of guy whom wish my partner by my side all the while.
-4	negative	suicide	Today someone knocked me down..broke my trust I am writing this here and not as a message because i wanted to confess this in front of everyone..i am sorry.
-5	negative	suicide	To everybody that has been reading my last post when will I get over this? My eyes are swollen and red from crying for 4 days straight. Idk what to do :/ having my dog for almost 10 years caused us to have an unbreakable bond. Now that my baby girl is gone idk what to do my heart literally aches. Guess that is what a broken heart feels like.
-1	negative	suicide	Tomorrow is December 14th. It will mark the 12th year since both my parents were taken away :'(
-2	negative	suicide	Two days ago my world crashed now I'm trying to find out if Cymbalta, Celexa, Topamax, and Ativan will help ease my pain
-6	negative	suicide	Two of my best guy friends say they were going to kill their selves because other people have told them to die.  I told both of them how much they mean to me but both of them just pushed me away. luckily they didn't.
-8	negative	suicide	Two or three years ago, I cut my wrist. I really feel want to die that time. My boyfriend left me. And I just so stupid to think that it is the end of the world. I didn't think about my family and friends reaction. I just want to die and the pain feeling will b gone forever. That is why I decide to cut my wrist. Well, luckily, I was found by my friend and he stopped to continue that. Then the cut is treated very good and now, there is no scar left. I am happy that he saved me that time. If he didn't came and stopped me, I won't be here anymore, I wouldn't be able to meet many wonderful people. I am lucky that I survived my suicide. After that incident, I swore to myself that I won't ever do suicide again. You shouldn't do that too..
-12	negative	suicide	Two summers ago, my parents had gone away for three weeks for vacation. I had thrown a party with close friends. Drinking and having a good time, i soon became drinking to hide away my pain over the past couple of months.. I became hysterical when each drink was for all the hurt ive been covering up. I took bottles of all different pills and hid away in one of my bathrooms. My friends soon became upset, and confused. They didn't understand what had happen, or what i was doing. I was trying to kill myself i told them, and to leave me be. I took over 60 different pills that belonged to my mother. I didn't expect to live but waking up the next morning sick as a dog, with my friends by my side. I was confused and in a way happy they had stuck around to make sure i was okay. I was sick throwing up a lot of the next couple of days.. but my experience had changed my life i can't start to explain. 
-2	negative	suicide	Underground tube tickets, receipts, photos, knick knacks and doodles are usually found in my purse. I like looking back on things and remembering where I got them. I still have this wooden bead that I found at uni in my winter coat and hold it in my hand inside the pocket when wearing it.
-6	negative	suicide	U you I haven't had a lot of trouble quitting this time I think it s cause I had someone who understood. Theirs been a lot  of stress in the house and relationship . The smell of smoke would make me sick. But today I had a n old feeling of Mmm I want one.  I didn't but it getting hard again. Thank you for your time ..
-13	negative	suicide	We all have a time in our life where we consider suicide. Some it goes on for days, months, even years. Others it might just be a brief moment and that's it. Everyone has has some sort of struggle in thier life. However no matter how hard it is, always think to yourself. I might miss the greatest time of my life if I do this. I have attempted suicide in my past. I'm very glad I didn't succed cause I would have never met the man I have been with for 6 years. i went from being called fugly everyday to a man who tells me I'm beautiful everyday. My heart goes out to anyone who is suffering from this struggle. I hope that one day you beat this. 
-2	negative	suicide	.. weird time.. That's what I'm looking for, respect.
-1	negative	suicide	Well another year has begun and I feel for all the smokers who are struggling to quit because of a new years resolution. Leif
-4	negative	suicide	Well folks, remember that tickling site from 6 months ago? That one that prided itself on the Cyber Tickling Center and all that great stuff? Well, we were down for a while, but we're coming back from the dead, and rapidly. Message or PM me if you have any questions for me! I'd be glad to answer them!
-3	negative	suicide	Well I had one. Divorce is in progress. Because what you allow continues.
-3	negative	suicide	Well the spelling of this experience is wrong so I'm in the hospital on observation, I took a mouthful of pills and now fill regret more than a desire to die. My life is great and utterly falling apart.  I've got great kids a wonderful life but I keep losing jobs, overwhelmed with debt, and can't support my family.  Everything stresses me out, I yell and scream at those closest to me, medication is not helping.  I'm full of anxiety and I don't know how to pick myself up and continue after this.
-2	negative	suicide	well, this is my second attempt at writing tonight. my first time it was practically an novel and apparently it wasn't mature for people below the age of 18. it was terrible. ive never wanted to die so much in my whole life. ive never needed it so much.ive never been this helpless. 
-8	negative	suicide	What does it all mean. .. life?How many times how many tears fell. To the ground  my hope, lost in a paradox I can't see the way out. my heart, halved and shattered. When all the ones who love you are screaming through your deaf ear. They want you to come Back. but you refuse!you refuse to stay!you want to run away! away from the pain!But!!It follows you, can you survive life or will it consume you. We cannot see what is not here. If only I wasn't alone. Can you understand this pain T T  I'm losing my hope. Please save me
-1	negative	suicide	What is the point of living? I just can't take it. I want to pull all my hair out, crawl under a rock, and die.
-7	negative	suicide	What might this guy be thinking? Met a guy online a few months back, went on a few normal dates, made out once on my couch, started dating I suppose.  But haven't seen each other since before Xmas and he sends vague messages saying things like 'I miss you' and 'hugs' (gag) then doesn't specifically ask me anywhere.  He's cancelled on me in the past (once when we had concert tickets which irritated me).  He seems like a guy I'd get to know more, but I want him to put in some effort.
-1	negative	suicide	What's the age for medical license in ontario ?
-3	negative	suicide	What's the point of life? It's depressing me.
-2	negative	suicide	Whats up, you ask? Death. It really is. Its above us all, falling, fast. Its true, you can't avoid it. Its gonna hit you smack on the head without you even knowing it. But now its time to wonder what death really is, and then maybe even the various ways of death.
-1	negative	suicide	What's your favourite strain of weed??
-1	negative	suicide	When I'm really depressed, I'll start to contemplate hopeless thoughts and suicide. And now I know for me that's a warning sign. I know that at this point I need some help, whether meds or talk to somebody.
-13	negative	suicide	When I was 13 I lost my parents to a fire. So I stabbed myself in the belly button. Suicide is something that you must be certain to do so I chose the hardest way to kill myself. I had stuck the knife pointing upwards on my bed where my stomach would be. I stood at the other end of the bed and fell on it. It only went in one " at first. So I grabbed it and pulled on it so it went in another 2" and again so the 6" knife was completely through me. I was screaming in pain through this so help came. Clearly I survived and I regret trying to kill myself for the few years after that were really good until the crash
-1	negative	suicide	When I was 18 I lost everyone around me: friends, family, coworkers, significant others.   
-9	negative	suicide	When I was a bairn I was scared of storms, I got over it a few years ago, I watched a storm in the distance with the lightning coming down, and saw how cool it looked.  I suggest Astraphobes try this, it might not be easy, but if you can force yourself to watch a storm and think about how beautiful and amazing it is!
-6	negative	suicide	When I was little my dad used to beat me. Most of the time it was because my grades weren't good enough or I lied to him or simply just disappointed him as a daughter. Now that I'm not living at home anymore he stopped and our relationship got better. He apologized for what he did. But I'm still really scared when he is mad at me because I always fear that he will start again.
-3	negative	suicide	When I was younger, ages 14 and 17, I took a full bottle of Wellbutrin and another time vyvanse. "Why didn't it work?" Is what I think all the time. Now I kind of wish it did work
-6	negative	suicide	When I was young, my grandmother had a friend who was very close to our family.  He was, I found out later, a college teacher and my aunt was one of his students at some point. He may not be family (in the literal sense), but I miss him very much.  And I hope that, if he were here, he would be proud of me.
-17	negative	suicide	When my mom passed away during cancer surgery, I was devastated.   A neighbor told us that when his father had passed, he started finding pennies in unusual places, like in bed with him.  He said he knew it meant his father was with him.  The next day, as I was helping my dad gather some of my mother's belongings, he offered to me a purse and wallet that she hadn't used for years.  I checked, and they were completely empty, so I put them in my room.  The next day, when I opened the wallet to put my ID and credit cards in, I found penniesthree of them: one for me, one for my dad, and one for my brother.  I really had checked and verified that the purse and wallet were both empty the day before
-4	negative	suicide	Where do I start. I'm overweight I've got no job I'm in trouble with the police for insurance fraud, my baby has a whole in his heart my boyfriends family can't stand me and reject my 3 boys he has a daughter ( who doesn't like me and makes up lies about me an which my boyfriends family lap up to fuel their dislike for me. Can anyone help
-6	negative	suicide	Where else can I make this confession? I don't really want anyone I know to have this information, I simply have a story to tell. It seems best to release it onto a vast ocean of miscellaneous voices that make up the experience project.  
-1	negative	suicide	Why are so many people complaining about being single? Being single is awesome! I can do what I want or who I want and not feel the pressures of a relationship. I don't want to be settled down at twenty years old I want to experience life and do crazy things!  Why is it so important to have a boyfriend or girlfriend? We should all learn to be independent in this world, I'm not saying everyone should be a lone wolf forever but just why do we need a relationship to be happy? I've never been more happy in my life I am doing the things I want to do.
-1	negative	suicide	Why do some people hate being single? I think it's less stressful and you save yourself a lot of money, right? - Emily&lt;3
-1	negative	suicide	why u are feeling like that. 
-2	negative	suicide	Will I ever find that one Is killing me.
-16	negative	suicide	Years ago in middle school was the time that it was on my mind. I was feeling that there was no other way to be happy or at least not feel horrible. I hated being bullied at school along with emotional abuse at home. I lived apart from most of my family and was isolated from people I knew. I almost did it, but chose not to at the last second. The thoughts still come up at times, but I know I could never do that. I have gotten through too much and accomplished too much to give up. Plus, my brother and sister have already committed suicide and I know what the effect would have on my family.  
-4	negative	suicide	Yes it is true, I have thought about it a lot. I have even tried before. I believe that part of my life is over. I haven't cut since June too so I believe I am better on that part of my life
-1	negative	suicide	Yesterday November 13, 2013 I went downstairs to get my Mommy and I found her dead on the floor. I always thought mommies lived forever but I guess that's not true. I don't know what to do anymore, my Mommy helped me make my decisions. Her being gone is still a shock. I don't know what to do..but i'm lucky that the last thing we said to eachother was "I love you" and not something horrible. I don't know how to cope with finding her dead..she was just 50..and i'm only 17.. How could she be gone?.. I miss her
-8	negative	suicide	Y sad ? well thr a lot of reasons big one is I have lost a lot belief i people and myself and lost so much confidence so my life is going nowhere right now.  y lonely? its because all the friends I had ( and I had enough) are not in my contact anymore thats becoz i have stopped talking to them for a long while because I was too sad back then to share anything with anyone and a few close I have are themselves too busy in their lives. 
-10	negative	suicide	Yup . Well It was horrible feeling to feel That nothing matters that much anymore . I told my husband how I felt I didint matter and him being the abussive person he is got mad and opened all my sleeping pill anxiety everything poured it on the counter and told me fine the then just die . I walked over took them all . At some point he called the ambulance i remember them picking me up but every thing else is blank .

-11	negative	unemployment	2005, January 23, My Sisters best friend took suicide, And because of this My sister got really depressed and took her life February 2. My mum and dad found her in the bathroom. Then at 2008, Juny 28 I found my mum and dad talking in the kitchen. I was just 12 and just thought they were talking normally, I was wrong. 4 days later I found both of them hanging in the kitchen with a suicide note saying: I'm so sorry son, We felt so deppresed after your sister took her life and can't stand it anymore. Forgive us. How can I come over this?
-9	negative	unemployment	2 years ago when I was in 6th grade this boy (let's call him bob) anyways bob would say things about me "behind" my back. Some are "Atleast I am dating _____ she's a stick compared to _____(me)____" or "Hey guys there's __me___ her face belongs at #1 on most ugly." Anyways luckily he forgot about it and he's not bugged me since. I remember all his words though.
-7	negative	unemployment	3/23/14 Almost 10 years since Stormy-Denice's passing. How can it be? How can my 12 year old daughter be gone forever? It makes no sense that this life that I cared for with all my heart and soul was wiped out in one cataclysmic moment. What makes life? Where did it go? What can I do to bring it back?
-1	negative	unemployment	7th grade. Mom broke up with her *sshole boyfriend and he took our dog of 6 years with him. 
-19	negative	unemployment	A few days ago I found out that my friend's grandpa was in the hospital and it wasn't looking good at all.  After hearing the news I walked up to my apartment thinking about my friend and hoping that he would be okay and that she would be able to visit him before things got worse.  I was worried because I knew she was working and unable to leave and it really sounded like he wasn't going to make it.  I said a little prayer and as I reached my floor I looked down and saw a dime heads up.  I picked it up and looked at it.  It had my birth year on it.  Somehow seeing that dime made me realize he would be okay.  Hours later my friend was able to go visit her grandpa and he is still doing good. 
-16	negative	unemployment	After 5 and a half years my fiance left me because I lied to her.  She keeps her money in her safe.  Late one night, I went into her safe, and took money out.  I left it in a hoodie pocket and went to bed.  When I woke up, she had walked the dog and taken my hoodie.  Knowing I had no money of my own, she knew I had done it.  When she asked me, I swore I didn't do it, later she found that I had her key.  It ruined her trust in me, especially since this wasn't the first time.  All I want to do is become an honest person and show her that.  Show her that I love her.
-1	negative	unemployment	All my life i've been keeping my anger in for a long time and when people talk bad about me i shake it off but i still feel it in me im feeling more an more angry and it scares me to think what i might do i get thoughts of hurting  the people close to me like i hate anger i hate pain but when i hate more anger comes
-6	negative	unemployment	Always when it gets toward the end of the month, I get broke. Then I have to live on credit.Today is Father's Day. I want to take my husband out to breakfast, lunch, or dinner. It'll be credit again. I am so sick of this. I just don't manage my money well. You'd think I would learn, wouldn't you? But I never do.
-2	negative	unemployment	Am having a moment where my head is not buzzing with a million thoughts at once. There's only one voice. Almost forgot what that was like 
-9	negative	unemployment	Anger is an emotion, we learn from an early age how to handle emotions. We build a response that works for us at that young age. Violence worked well in the playground, so bullies were kept at bay or became bullies themselves but as people age, they grow out of their childhood things and are expected to become adults. It is much better to deal with the anger responses at source with new learnings so there will never been a time when your anger danger comes out to play. 
-17	negative	unemployment	Another disappointment.  Another "thanks, but no thanks".  Another "they went with another candidate".   Another "they really liked you, but".  How much more rejection can I take?  I've applied to so many jobs.  I've had so many interviews that I'm tired of hearing myself talk.  And the biggest frustration of all is not knowing Why.  Why am I not getting hired? No one can tell me.  There's never a concrete reason.  I have over 20 years experience in my field.  I have a Bachelor's Degree and am close to my Masters.   I have even been willing to apply for jobs that pay $20k less than what I was making.   I feel that I'm at my wit's end.  Today was another rejection.  So today, I cried.      Update: As of today, September 25, 2013, I am no longer unemployed. Just got a job offer. Thank you all for your support. For those of you that responded and are looking for work, hang in there. It WILL happen for you.
-3	negative	unemployment	Another stainanother mess to clean. Pieces to gather and emotions to cut. Another jab to my battered heartwon't you ever learn? No one cares they only useonly the strong survive in this decaying world. And you, you are nothing more than a pawn.

-4	negative	unemployment	April 22 of this year made a year my brother has been gone.today all day pennies has been appearing.appearing on me! On my chest every time well I got into a car wreck and when I got home.I lay on my side there's another penny.this is unbelievable 
-1	negative	unemployment	A real man would never hit a  girl not matter what happen I and to know that there are men out there that have hit a girl because  they did not do what they wanted makes me sick and ashamed to call myself a man. For every bad guy that hurt a  girl in anyway. Makes it that much harder for a real man to show that beautiful women she is worth loving and being cared for that I was not her fault. That she is smart kind beautiful funny down to earth  to sum up she is amazing
-10	negative	unemployment	As requested, I'm gonna write about my weird encounter with a homeless lady.  Ok so one day.. I think I was about 8 or 9 maybe. Well anyways my mom and I were at the hair salon really late and I was hungry so she drove me up to Subway. We parked and were walked up to the door. Well since it was late they were only doing drive-in orders. We were walking back to our car when some lady was running at us and screaming at us to wait. My mom freaked out and yelled at me to get in the car. We drove to the drive-in where the guy at the window called the police. I'm not sure if she spent a night in jail or not. But that's my crazy story about a homeless person.
-4	negative	unemployment	At this point in my life, I have a pretty good idea WHAT I want to be and become during the rest of it. A writer, for one thing. A ridiculous polyglot. Someone who changes the world in some big vague way. So now that I'm not living in that slough of despond, now that I have a modicum of security and stability I still can't answer the question "How?"
-22	negative	unemployment	Back a while ago I was in a serious car wreck. It was just my friend driving and I was along for the ride. He decided to go into the country to see how fast he could go. We went faster and faster yet he did not care. Once we took air it was over. The joy had ended and fear was in my eyes. When the car touched down we went towards a tree and he jerked the wheel and the car went into a ditch and started to roll. It rolled on its side for almost half a mile. The whole time I thought I was going to die. My head bashed the window and my arm went out and got rolled on. I woke in the hospital a day later and the world was different. I saw things clear for the first time. I saw that who I thought was my friend really wasn't. He did not care that he had almost killed me nor did he care that it was all his fault. I still to this day have nightmares about that wreck that seem so real it's as if I am living it all over again. This is my story.
-2	negative	unemployment	Being a published author is my dream That's what I want to do for the rest of my life
-3	negative	unemployment	Being in the right place at the right time isn't the key to success. Realising that you're there and doing something about is the key. Just have a look first then judge because your judgement could have been wrong in the first place. 
-14	negative	unemployment	Buried my mommy last week after an 8 month battle with Melanoma. She was doing great, then all if a sudden had some sharp pain in her side a couple days before Thansgiving. She died a week later. I flew in just hours after she passed. I had to say goodbye through FaceTime. She was such a loving brave woman. I tried so hard to get her good medical care. We extended her life by four months with a new drug called Zelboraf. She had few if any side affects. It was such a blessings. I was even less prepared to bury her four months ago when she first put her in the hospital. It all happened so fast.

-15	negative	unemployment	But I'm learning to deal with it! As a child, I was seldom told no by my loving family. Then I entered the world of strangers and failed to realize I would not be treated the same. I used to think I was better then other people and would become silently enraged when they got higher opportunities then me. Now, I understand everyone has their strengths and weaknesses, and the people that get far have patience, humility, and the ability to work hard, connect to other people, believe in themselves aside from making comparisons. I still to this day get mad when I see someone doing better at want I want to do, but I catch myself two seconds after, tell myself it's wrong, take a deep breathe, promise to treat them and myself kindly, and choose to coexist instead of compete. My time has come and will continue coming as I shed my ego.

I haven't been the same I question how ill move on and how I can live with life but I live on because I know my mom wouldn't want me to end my life and that she would want me to be strong so that is why I am here writing now
-3	negative	unemployment	don't you just love your day off?? its a day to get out of your job that you don't love..its not that my job is miserable and that i hate it , it is just that i think this is not the right job for me, it is too opposite from my personality. i really am a very quite type of person who always like peace and solitude, but what did i end up a job very opposite to that. i worked in a pub where i have to deal with people and the worst part is also have to deal with loud music.. i always want a career change but its really hard if you don't even know what job to shift, besides its even harder to risk if that job you are stuck with is supporting your family financially(but its not helping me emotionally)..and right now i don't even have an idea what to write next..

-7	negative	unemployment	Ever since I was little, I've enjoyed pretending I was someone else. It started off with characters from my favourite books and movies, and then me and my sister would make up characters and act as them.  I swore it wouldn't happen again, because I really cared for Melissa, and I hurt her. But even now it hasn't changed. When I meet new people I tell them I'm from England or Scotland, and I usually follow up with a different age. I like to make up characters and act like them in public and on the internet. I feel like it's a problem and I should stop, but I can't help it. I love to be anything but what I am.

-12	negative	unemployment	Failure is defined as an event that does not reach its intended purpose.  How many times have you failed? I know I have lost count. To sum it up, I have failed more times than I know of and can countBut here I still am. That means our failures aren't the end of us. My failures have sharpened me and molded me into where I am today. Failing is impossible to avoid which means I have no control over it. What I do have control of is how I react.
-6	negative	unemployment	Failure is never an end to things, but a beginning of something.  And everyday i find a reason to smile and build something new for myself. My heart is ready for every failure i encountered, i forgive myself and try again. I love this life!

-10	negative	unemployment	For a few years, I lived off unemployment.  I couldn't, for the life of me, find a job after losing mine in 2009. Now I have 2 part-time jobs.  One as a cashier at Party City, the other as a Fan Photographer at Best Buy Theater.  These jobs are very part-time and I'm constantly looking for full time work.  These 2 jobs aren't good enough for my mother.  She is always saying "I wish you can get a full time job!".  When she says that, I find myself turning to her and saying "Don't you think I want the same thing?"  I tend to raise my voice, but don't mean to.  She says it all the time.  Sometimes I want to lie to her to shut her up, but that's not in me, especially with my mother.

-11	negative	unemployment	For me eating is a waste of time. Yes it's a necessity but the amount of time some people spend eating is astounding. Not only do I find it a waste of time I find it slows me down, the worst feeling in the world is the one after eating too much.  If I could live without food I would. I hate it, it's a waste of time and effort and I really needed to get that off my chest. I don't think it's unhealthy, after all not eating helps clears my head and helps me focus whereas food slows me down and leaves me feeling sluggish.

-18	negative	unemployment	Good day!I am a Filipino. I am writing to you because I am desperate to have a normal life. My dad underwent triple bypass in 2004. He was in and out of the hospital until he died lastdec 10 2011. In 2009 I had hodkins lymphoma stage 2A. I survived in 2010. I am full of debts. If only you can lend me 300,000 in Philippine money or $4,500. This is to pay my debts and so i can start even a small business. If that small business will be successful i want to build an import and export business. The reason why my dad died is because we cant afford to bring him to the hospital anymore. And he doesnt want to be brought to the hospital. He said "huwag na lang. Wala tayong pera. Ako ng bahala" in english " Dont. We dont have money. Leave it to me." I still have my mom and she is 72 years old under my care. Please help me. I can pay you monthly for 3years. Please help me.

-9	negative	unemployment	Hello there, I have been currently homeless for a period of 4 months and counting. It's a little sad in my mind I have been looking on the bright side of my situation. I graduated from college with a degree and worked full-time. I had it all; my apartment, my studio, my awesome grades and my health. I was a teaching assistant and a librarian through the school. I was very happy or in better terms comfortable. I had money coming in and putting art out that was well received. But then I graduated, honorary degree and all. But that meant the college jobs had ended, and real life begun.  
-3	negative	unemployment	Here is an article I wrote that gives another example of a great part time job you can do while your looking for work.  Hope this helps everyone out! 
-9	negative	unemployment	He was the first man who ever made me FEEL loved. Yet anytime I said - hey that bothers me- about anything at all- he would stop talking to me. He would disappear for days,not answer the phone, not respond to texts. Once, he got mad at me for something and left me sitting alone for two days in the hotel I rented for his birthday.  So now he is gone again. For the last time. I'm still in love with him. He saved my life and made me feel I found my place in the world. I have no idea what goes on in his head- he ignores me completely. After three years together, I will probably never see or hear from him again.

-14	negative	unemployment	Hey so I wanted to vent somewhere and I decided to do this here. After months of searching and utilizing my methods, I finally was able to find a job. This, in turn, inspired me to start my own blog and job search engine. I have incorporated the top job boards in my search engine to provide up to the minute job updates for people seeking a job. The strategies I used are outlined in the "Blog" section of the site. This site took a lot of work and I slowly built it out over time. It is going to get bigger, include more job boards to search and more feature. I will constantly be updating it to provide you with the top notch unemployment help available. The site is simply HelpImUnemployed.com. Give it a shot and provide me some feedback so I can improve it!  I really hope it helps you as much as it helped me!

-4	negative	unemployment	hi everyone - probably like most people on this forum i am sat here on a weekday in my dressing gown scouring the internet for agency jobs. always been a good worker but resigned whilst under investigation for potential gross misconduct. was allowed to work notice (was not suspended but decided for the sake of sanity to go off on sick leave for the duration of notice). anyway, sending off lots of cv's to temp agencies for similar work in the meantime. scared i wont ever have another perm job again because of investigation/possible outcome of investigation which is still ongoing despite my resignation. feeling sadness, anger, unspeakable amounts of stress, becoming boring because this is all i am thinking about. one day of course i will be able to accept and come to terms of what happened. it isnt always black and white, however how do communicate that to potential employers? just feel absolutely rotten and need some comfort.
-3	negative	unemployment	Hi guys I was reading through some of the posts on here and I knew this was the right place to look. 
-11	negative	unemployment	Hi guys.. I was reading through some of the posts on here and I wanted to let you guys in on a program from home I was introduced to by a friend of mine. Its a great way to make some extra money while your unemployed or even if you are employed and have an extra hour or so a day you could do this.. The program is BBB Accredited and all it requires you to do is post ads and each person that signs up you get $25 for. I started a few weeks ago and I've been making at least $50-$200 a day, and I usually get around 2-10 people a day so far. I was a little skeptical at first but im so glad I joined now. There's no monthly membership fees like most other work from home jobs and its only $25 to sign up.. you never pay another dime and you are a member of the program and have the ability to make money for life. I made my $25 back within the first couple of hours. If you guys are interested heres the website -  or you can email me at justinamcip@gmail.com - good luck!

-6	negative	unemployment	Hi, I am a compulsive liar and i need help. I have told many lies  to friends, family, the love of my life and to myself. Its like it comes natural sometimes without thought. It started when i was young, when i often told lies to stay out of trouble, or to fit in. Now that Im older its becoming a huge burden in my relationship, now I lie to protect feelings. One thing I've learned is that, its better to hurt with the truth than to protect with a lie

I have done everything from flipping burgers to Auto mechanics, I mean everything in between as well. I will start on my tasks at work and I think I'm doing my tasks fast but its takes me hours just to complete one project. It got to the point where I relocated to a different state because I couldn't find any other work where I grew up, and now I'm sleeping on a friends couch, just trying to find work in this area, And not a cent to my name with bills adding up and no leads for work. I'm getting so frustrated, there are days I just wish I didn't wake up. I know that's not the answer, but I don't know what else to do any more. Can anyone help me understand how to fix this Please.

I feel like I'll be a better person if I just buy this new bag or get this new makeup and often I end up not even liking it or using/ wearing it, but at the time I feel so elated and happy it's like a drug and then when I look at my account and realize I don't really need all these small items I feel low and flat and I just can't seem to save up for a Europe trip I've been planning but putting off for years because I just didn't have the money. Does anyone have any advice I feel like this is a serious problem and I'm just realising it!
-6	negative	unemployment	I am 16 years old and have hopeful plans to attend Missouri University of Science and Technology.  Of course anything to help ease the financial toll of attending this college is greatly appreciated, but I have been given an opportunity that I cannot turn down.  I have one major problem with this outstanding opportunity, finances.  I have received a Congressional Invitation to attend a 3-Day Conference  in Washington DC from the National Academy of Future Physicians.  This opportunity is an extremely rare one, with a rather steep cost.  The total cost of the conference is $1,684, that does not include Airfare, food, and general expenses. This rare opportunity would look extremely well on a college resume, and at this conference comes with the opportunity for over $200,000 in scholarships.  Please help me pay for this exquisite opportunity that only comes once in a lifetime!! The deadline for payment is December 15th!!! Please help!!
-3	negative	unemployment	I am 21 and my 'boyfriend' is 30. We have what could be considered an open relationship. My parents have met him twice and really like him, but they don't know we're dating. When I graduate college in May, I'm planning on moving to another state. He is more than willing to come with me and I think that would be wonderful, but that would bring up more than a few questions. I have no problem telling my parents, but I'm not sure how to negotiate an nonawkward and drama-free move-in while keeping everyone happy. Moving to another state and living with the man I love would be amazing, but I can't help feeling like crazy dreams like that just don't come true in my life. Other crazy-awesome things happen, just not the things I plan.

-11	negative	unemployment	I am a college graduate but I can't find a job within my field. There aren't many jobs available where I'm from and much less in my area of studies. I'm not too experienced either. I'm scared that all that time I spent frustrated because of classes will never pay off. I'm considering doing a Master's degree but I can't do that without finding a job first. To be able to continue my studies, I would have to move away and I can't do that without money saved up. My biggest problem is no one will hire me. I had a seasonal job and I managed to save up, but time goes by without finding a job and the money in my bank keeps decreasing. I was interviewed for a book store I really wanted to work at, and I nearly bursted into tears when I was told they hired all their new staff and I never got a call back. I get so nervous during interviews that I mess up. I'm just so anxious to get a job, that when a job opportunity comes along, I panic. I really hope I get a job soon.

-2	negative	unemployment	I am feeling worthless.  I became unemployed over a year and a half ago after being a teacher for two years.  I then received a pre-k teacher position at a small organization.  I was shocked when I received a call around Christmas time saying that my services are not needed for better and I feel like I'm an alcoholic.  I crave alcohol everyday and I can't stop until I am drunk.  I feel bad for my son because every morning my son crawls in bed with me and says, "get up mommy. come on mommy wake up". but I don't want to get out of bed I don't want to do anything during the day.  I don't have any health insurance to talk to a doctor.  I just want to feel better and be reassured that my life is going to turn out for the better.

I need my mum and i can't talk to my dad because he molested me. I feel like i'm going down a dark path and all i can think about is stopping and ending everything because i just can't carry on. My GCSEs are this year an i can't see myself getting through them without her. I just want my mum
-14	negative	unemployment	I am going to turn 50 years old on Saturday, April 25th.  I was a practicing criminal defense attorney for 20 years, I was suspended from practice in July 2011.  I have been applying for work, administrative, management, safety/compliance jobs every day.  I am in need of $350,000.00 to become debt free, my home is on a contract for deed at $1,700 per month, with about $20,000.00 in equity, I have a tax lien of $42,000.00, and still have $100,000.00 in student loans.  I live in Grand Forks, ND and have been married for 28 years.  Willing to work hard, but cannot catch a break.  I have two $500,000.00 term life insurance policies that are current to date, have been contemplating suicide to at least provide a financial solution for my wife. Scared and desperate, help me please. During my law practice I helped many impoverished clients at reduced rates, and many times for free, now that I need help, I have no where to turn.
-14	negative	unemployment	I am in tears because I am broke. I graduated college five years ago and yet I have not found steady work. I worked at a bunch of crappy places and experienced severe bullying. The last job I had I was laid off from in October 2011 and that was two years ago. Now, I freelance write articles but that still isn't enough to cover all my expenses. To make things worse I suffer with chronic 24/7 headaches and migraines and I have no insurance. I am 27 and I'm still leaving at home with my parents, can't buy a car, can't find steady employment and living in chronic pain. There is no hope. I really want to end my life. To the outside world I appear lazy but I'm not, it's just a rough time for me. I wish I was a celebrity or someone with millions of dollars. 
-2	negative	unemployment	I am Kenneth Kendrick better known as the whistleblower against peanut corp of America that caused the largest food recall in hx Foodsafetyadvocate.webs.com
-1	negative	unemployment	I am not perfect and I never will be or want to be. I like getting lost once in a While because it takes me to places I never would gone to.
-6	negative	unemployment	I am only 17. 17 year olds should be out spending their money they make at their part time jobs and out having fun. Haha nope, not me. I'm the type of person to save their money and i'm almost afraid to ever be completely broke. I think of the future most, I think of the family I'll have and the things I'll have to pay for and it is just scary, to know that you may not have enough money to get by at some points in life. I just thought to share my experience, as it is not just me who can attain this goal, but anyone with the will to do so, and quite frankly, I want to be the one to help anyone who needs it. Just ask me about it, I'd love to help you out ^_^
-1	negative	unemployment	I am originally from the East coast. My family was going through difficult times when I was younger. My family was pretty poor. It didn't help that my step dad was an abusive alcoholic that would constantly loose his jobs.
-3	negative	unemployment	I am scared. I am terrified of the future. I am scared of tomorrow. I am scared because I know that they will notice that I shouldn't be here and that they will correct me. I am scared that sometime soon someone will notice and kill me before I can do it for them. I am scared and the only reason I am still alive is because I have rituals. Because I save myself with walks, with touching certain things, thinking certain things.
-2	negative	unemployment	I am single and probably gonna stay that way I've only had meaning less flings with girls in my college but I'm not complaining
-2	negative	unemployment	I am trying to finish my dissertation and I need your help! I am studying how people cope with the stress of unemployment. www.psychdata.com/s.asp?SID=147486
-18	negative	unemployment	I am unemployed and have been for over 12 years now, due to being mentally ill, though I am much better now, I still take meds, I have many skills and I volunteer but I Cant get a job, due to having no good work record for the past 12 years and before that, since I was 22. I am now 56, I would like to set up a business but do not have any capital, I would like to work in hotel reception but I do not know the new type of switchboards they use and must pay to learn, which I dont have the money for.  Other than that I could get a reception job if I had a good work record. But the youth coming into the country from Europe are taking the jobs, I live in the UK. At 56 who will take a chance on me? no one. I am bored stiff so I study with the OU and I have learned web design and do charity websites, but I have no way of earning money. 
-1	negative	unemployment	I am unemployed for 4 years and I live in Greece. How about that! It is more possible to see a flying elephant than to find a descent job here. 
-1	negative	unemployment	I am unemployed for the first time in my working life, 22 consecutive years of actual employment (not counting the lawn cutting the years for thatactual workforce).  I am a professional engineer and have been for a number of years. Thanks very muchalso new hereso forgive any instances of violating board etiquette (written or unwritten) in my post.
-8	negative	unemployment	I and my 5 yo son have until tomorrow to leave. The shelter manager wanted us gone today, but the case manager convinced him to let us stay an extra day. The reason? Missing out on chores because I'm 8 weeks pregnant and have been going through extreme fatigue, nausea, and pain on top of that because of having to stop all my presc Just plain awful, and if I hadn't stayed in better shelters in the past, this would have been my last attempt at ever staying in one. But I know there's better shelters out there, this just isn't one of them. 
-9	negative	unemployment	I applied for multiple jobs. I am very qualified to work at a vet's office because of my past experience. The only place I have applied to that said they would call me back was Victorias Secret. I am so frustrated. I have 2 other jobs that I would much rather get but I haven't heard back from them.
-6	negative	unemployment	i cant be online for long..  my real family doesnt want me as their daughter.. im alone. again..  my pimp got really mad.. he beatend up my friends.. my baby's..  so yea i went back to him.. he let them go..  im just here on the streets again. taking some drugs.. doing men..  got my christmass meal yesterday :P they were giving away free food at the train station.. so i got some soup and bread ^^ first time i had food in over 5 days..   i miss u guys..  
-5	negative	unemployment	I can't change anything about what has happened to me in life. I can change the hurt the pain the embarrassment the feelings of abandonment. I sit and ponder at times of all the things I could have done to change things. I have to let them go. I have to send them off where they belong into nothingness. Sever the ties to the last that cause me pain today. I need to focus on now and of tomorrow. I tend to loose to much being stuck in the past.
-8	negative	unemployment	I cheated. With someone who turn out to be a crazy stalker. I was unhappy in my relationship and looking for an out . Now I'm still in my same relationship and my bf is a drunk & verbally abusive but I allow it bc I feel bad for what I did to him. In some ways I think I deserve to be constantly put down for what I did.
-7	negative	unemployment	I constantly am reminding myself that what has been done cannot be undone. I can only change what I do. I consistently dwell on the past, but lately I haven't been wanting to go back in time so desperately as I had before. Maybe that is a positive sign of acceptance? All that I have been through has shaped me into the person that I am today.
-5	negative	unemployment	I contracted post-traumatic-stress-disorder after a particularly violent year in Rio de Janeiro. I was there to stay with my aunt-in-law's mother who was dying. I didn't quite know how long my brother would need me around. Those of you with PSTD, my prayers go out to you. This is simply a test of our Lord- you can and will make it through with the love of your friends and family. God bless.
-8	negative	unemployment	I couldn't believe I have lost you. Every time one turns around when I'm thinking of you, my heart always keep telling me you're always with me here. When I look at your pictures, I felt like we will return to day of our lives. Even though I know It won't be possible, because you passed away.     I don't know how long it takes waiting to see you again. I know you're looking down from the heaven and waiting for me right. I miss you with all my heart.
-7	negative	unemployment	I created a LinkedIn profile.  If you have a LinkedIn account go to Ben Saunders and ask to have me add you as a connection.  There you will find the beginnings of a high-profile effort to expose the malfeasance of American employers and the mean-spiritedness of hitting unemployed Americans with huge tax bills in the thousands.  You will also find some of my other anecdotes of malfeasance rather amusing.

-4	negative	unemployment	I currently have three dogs to replace the two My dogs died two years ago, and I haven't gotten over it since. But then again, all pets die I gues. 
-2	negative	unemployment	I decided to make a change and start building residual income If you're looking for something different. I'll be more than happy to share what it is I do. 
-13	negative	unemployment	I did exactly this today, when I finally got hold of him. I guess he was sleeping, but I went on and on bout how he is abandoning mebecause I went 12 hours without being able to talk to him. There is more to it than thisbut to make a very long story shortI will just say that I am a complete nutjob, and I am insecure and have mommy issues and abandonment issues and trust issuesand prolly many more. I am crazy. He is still thereand he listened to my rant and still loves meeven though he hasn't called me back yet.
-3	negative	unemployment	I didn't actually quit my current job but I am trying for my dream job.There is a lot of competition and many eligible candidates are trying for this job.But I am confident I will get it.I am determined to make it happen.I am going to work hard day and night because I know no other job can give me satisfaction.So I am taking an oath to give my best in the exam and interview. 
-1	negative	unemployment	I didn't know there is a name for people like me. In fact, for a long time I thought there was just something wrong with me. Then about three years ago, after some intense google searching trying to diagnose myself with some kind of mental disorder I came across the expression Introvert. Ok so that explains why I can't make new friends or hold down a job for more than a week. Sometimes I can't even go to the grocery store without getting a minor panic attack. To me, introversion is a curse. I don't want to be this way, but I can't change. I've just had to learn how to adapt my life around it.
-1	negative	unemployment	I didn't think it would get this bad, again. I'm asking for help. Please.
-2	negative	unemployment	I don't believe in perfection. Because that leaves no room for growth. I consider reaching for excellence. Becoming a person who his excellence of execution in what he does
-4	negative	unemployment	I dont even understand bullying . Lowering someones self esteem for what ? Punching/hurting them for what ? What is it going to solve ? Nothing . Bullying is sooo unacceptable . Thats just my opinion .
-6	negative	unemployment	I don't know where my dad lives anymore, but I miss him a lot  Me and him always argued and yelled at each other. There was also times where he broke my heart by making me cry when his words stung in a brutal way. At times around him I felt scared and unsafe, and even though he is not the best father-he said mean, horrible things to me and did a lot of bad things in his life. He also did a few good things like teach me how to play sports and I learned a little bit of wrestling from him. Sometimes he took me to eat out and go to the movies or baseball games. I don't know why, but he has so much hate in his heart. He changed and not for the better. Regardless of what he said and did-I forgive him and I still love him. I miss you, dad :/ Please call me sometime, or something.  
-2	negative	unemployment	I dont like to talk about personal stuff, but have found that in not doing so, it is hurting me & others even more.I know all of my flaws, I just need to take them on bit by bit.
-8	negative	unemployment	I dont really know where my home is anymore. People say it's where your dearest ones live but thas not true. I moved around quite a lot and this si the 5th town in the 3rd country. I alwaus used to think that my home was where I grew up and spend most of the time but now I really dont know. I miss the place so much it makes me cry sometimes but returning back there makes me feel like an intruder. I feel like I'll never be able to have a home. All this adventure and moving from place to place can be fun but if you have no home to return to then what's the point???
-7	negative	unemployment	I do spend most of my time with myself especially when I'm away from home. At the age of 22, I'm more mature than a typical 22 year old. My friends are way older than me but acts so immature. It's one reason I prefer to hang around with the older crowd who talks about things that actually makes sense. Not some crappy things that are useless to the mind.
-3	negative	unemployment	I enjoy flirting so long as it is reciprocal and not done in an aggressive fashion. I find it quite fun.
-2	negative	unemployment	I feel different each and everyday. Like mentally different, like a different person takes over. Some times I'll be really happy and bubbly, other days I'm depressed, but don't want to be alone. I feel like I should name them sometimes. Depression, remorse, loneliness, anger, excitement, boredom..they all need names. Maybe it's multiple personalities, but then again, maybe not. Who knows?
-4	negative	unemployment	I filed chapter 7 BK and was discharged over 2 years ago. About 2 weeks ago I was informed by a former employer that I had a pension plan I was unaware of. Since I was unaware of it at the time of the BK I did not disclose it. How much trouble am I in?
-10	negative	unemployment	I filed last year. I have 4.5 years to go. Leftover debt from a 38 marriage to someone with lots of problems. I have a house that's too big, but I can't sell for enough to be able to get something else so I am holding on in hopes to sell after the bankruptcy is discharged. I have a dog and 3 cats, so I can't rent. I support my son, who's 20 and hasn't launched yet, his GF who'd be homeless without us, and a friend of his who also has limited resources. It's really tough. If I work till I'm 70, I will have 5 yrs after the BK is discharged to downsize and get my act together so I can retire. Thank heavens for the Everything's a dollar store.
-4	negative	unemployment	If I were to die tomorrow would they say in livid poetry he didnt have much love and he waited around for her to fall deeply and madly from that tree over there
-2	negative	unemployment	If only others would treat me the way I would like to be treated.  Still, I guess I will try to stick to the high road.
-7	negative	unemployment	I found a legitimate company for making money while looking for work, through referral of my family and friends. It's a very generous company that was started by someone who was giving gifts to her friends, just trying to care about other people. Her gifts became very much in demand, so it turned into a business that is still very generous. Let me know if you would like to check it out. No charge for my time.
-9	negative	unemployment	I found myself in terrible debt of more than $40K with both credit cards and student loans, and way more was in the 'bad' debt category of credit cards. I had been in a profession that was high risk, and I thought I was balancing my good budgeting with the counterpoint of that 'one big sale' that would wipe out my debt in one fell swoop. Boy, was I wrong there. And so many of us gamble that way, wishing, hoping, or secretly expecting that we're going to wake up from the nightmare of the stress that carrying this debt is really causing. freefromdebtforever.com is where you'll find me.
-9	negative	unemployment	I found this poem before Buddy passed away and it helped me so much before and after his death. I searched for hours on the internet hoping to find something that would take the pain away as much as possible and this one was the closest. I hope it helps you. Please post any poems here that have helped you out - I'm sure we could all benefit from them
-13	negative	unemployment	If that's the right way to phrase it Maybe scattered or skittish is more appropriate. Definitely hoppy, like a crackhead playing hopskotch without knowing the rules or realizing the game has an end. Buzzing associations link everything to everything. Imagery comes to mind for every word I hear, see, and think. I see pictures that can overlap and obscure my real view. One time driving I got in a car accident just because I was singing the words to a song. I hadn't heard that band in a while and it felt like the right time to bust that can back open. I was feeling triumphant and enthusiastic.  When mere emotions can override thoughts and stir up mental frenzies a sense of caution might also be dig up. It can be alarming. 
-5	negative	unemployment	If you only had one wish, what would you ask for? So, there it is. If I had one wish, I would wish to speak perfectly like everyone else is able to do.
-7	negative	unemployment	if your into cisco networking let me know, i have all the material to study and take the ccna exam. i studied for the ccna before with a virtual study partner but stopped due to personal issue, he continued on and took it and passed. a good way for us to be productive while looking for work is commit a hour for studying for the exam. i have the material and we can be virtual study partners. one or more but want folks to be committed to  it. let me know. 
-3	negative	unemployment	If you suffer from PTSD or any form of depression, Ayahuasca can cure you. I have written my Ayahuasca story out on this site. You can read it in my stories. I talk about my childhood abuse, experience with depression and miraculous recovery.
-1	negative	unemployment	I get compliments on my eyes. I have very green eyes and people say my eyes are pretty.
-8	negative	unemployment	I give without receiving. I love without keeping. Every breath I take lacks meaning. My smile can be deceiving. I fake it till I make it, but there is no end, there is always another bend. I find myself wishing I was dead. I hate myself to my core, I want something to soothe my sores. 
-6	negative	unemployment	I got accepted into Penn State, and I can't afford to go to school there what am I going to do. The college is paying for most of my education with scholarships, but ran out of on campus housing. An I can't afford the off campus housing I have to give them almost 1000 every few months. How am I going to make it?
-3	negative	unemployment	I got a proper mattress for Bunko ( my car ) today , only took a month of sleeping rough . I'm living large tonight 
-1	negative	unemployment	I graduated 3 and a half years ago with little enough work experience to start with, no idea what I want to do and unable to imagine myself being any good at anything.  I just feel like I don't even know where to start, I can't even get hired for the most trivial jobs because of my Swiss-cheese resume and anything more ambitious I find terrifying. 
-2	negative	unemployment	I graduated from Saint Leo College in 1987. Inspite of my degree in Criminology I have never had a good job.
-12	negative	unemployment	I graduated hs in January but I wasn't 18 so it was hard finding a good job. My sons father got a job the end of February for 10 an hr. and he loves the good so I was happy for him. March I finally turned18 so I started looking all over. And I got a job that makes buns for McDonald's & many other companies. We also make muffins. I'm really excited but really nervous. I start this Monday!! It starts out on 13.10 then after my 90 days probation when they decide to keep me or not it will move to 14.10 and after 6 months of being there it goes to 15.10 plus a 200 bonus. I'm ready to move out of my moms home and this is it!!!
-11	negative	unemployment	I graduated just a couple of weeks short of a year ago and have still not managed to find full time employment. Post graduation I managed to get a paid summer job and then went on to do an internship (unpaid) until the end of the year before I started job hunting 'proper' in January. It has only been 5 months since I started job hunting but it's tough. Having been away from home, with the independence and freedom of student life, to be back at home in a town where there are few job opportunities is not the easiest. I hope this isn't too boring - I just needed to vent. Hopefully a few people can relate - I know it helps me a lot to read other people's thoughts/feelings/experiences on this site. Good luck with the ongoing job hunting everyone!
-12	negative	unemployment	I had a dachshund Lab mix named Willy. It was a beautiful, sunny day in May and we were running. I rarely used a leash with him because he would always stay by my side (what a mistake). On this day, I crossed the street and realized he was still on the other side. I ran into the street and called his name. Suddenly, a car rounded the corner and as he ran to me he was struck. I saw everything. I had to pick him up and carry him home. We buried him that night. I know it was my fault, and I still think about it often 6 months later.
-5	negative	unemployment	I had a friend who's mother was abused by my friends step- father. I can still remember how her mum came to pick her up from primary school with a black eye. I think it is disgusting. A man never should hit a woman.
-10	negative	unemployment	I had always suspected I had a problem with lying, but I never knew what kind of problem it really was. The lies happen before my brain has a chance to catch up. They come out, and it only taken a second to realize that I have no idea why I said the thing I just said. I'm terrible.
-14	negative	unemployment	I had the strangest experience yesterday where I was in a busy public place and I felt like I recognised all of the people I properly looked at, like I got that feeling of familiarity then after looking away I realised I couldn't place where they where from, then realised i did not know them at all. The weirdest was some girl working in asda, whilst in her presence I was convinced she was my old friends big cousin who used to teach us dance and even conjured up a memory, and now thinking about I realise I don't know her at all, that that memory never happened and I'm certain of that but i was so convinced it felt so real. Like i said it happened a lot but that was the most detailed, anyone heard anything like this before so I dont feel so weird haha?
-10	negative	unemployment	I had two dogs whom I loved dearly.  I took them everywhere with me.  I had a pickup truck, and put a cap on the back.  I replaced the sides and back with screens.  They would come with me to work every day, join me everywhere I went.  My connection to them, particularly the younger one, was very special. For me, coming home to two dogs excited to see me, playing with them, made me miss my dogs that much more.  I think in another month or so I will get another dog.
-7	negative	unemployment	I hate to admit this, but at times I still struggle with this.  I have not done this in a long time and I feel a lot of guilt about it.  I hide it from everyone, so no one knows. I know I'm admitting to this on a "public" forum I guess because I get pre-occupied about thoughts of doing it again, and honestly talking to strangers is at times easier than talking to my loved ones about this. I just feel so uncomfortable in the skin I'm in.  It's strange because I'm very outgoing.  I'm blessed with friends and familyi do struggle from depression and am currently under medical care for and I have had years of therapy.  I think I just get overwhelmed by the emotional pain I have experienced in my life that doing this "act" takes the focus of the emotional pain and forces me to concentrate on the physical pain inflicted. I know this is very dark and I am old enough to know better.   Please feel free to share your comments from your own experience, strength and hope. Thank you.
-3	negative	unemployment	I hate when people wrongfully and ignorantly mock mental illness, but i'm not gunna lie I make jokes at my own expense all the time. I have bipolar 1 and adhd and if I didn't joke it would STILL get me angry the whole thing. So although I hate when people are rude towards mental illness, you have to remember not to take it so seriously all the time. Peace (merry christmas to those who celebrate!)
-1	negative	unemployment	 I have a list so I'll start with I want to move away
-12	negative	unemployment	I have always worked, but due to both of my parents owning their own company, and also rental units - there has always been paying work for me even if I wasn't employed.  I believe this started a bad pattern of me just upping and quitting at the first sign of trouble.  Now even though I want to hold a job, I am continually unhappy and quit or find a better one first.  Now after going to counseling at the Dept. of Human Resources and them having me see a psychologist I tried a new career path as a nanny.  I like it but the 13 y.o. son hates me.  So I am looking at finding a new family, and thus the pattern is starting over again
-3	negative	unemployment	I have a side of me that tries to be happy, and joyful. A side that holds the person I wish I was.  I wish I was normal. I wish I met societies approval. Why does being different, have to have a price to pay?
-4	negative	unemployment	I have been actively searching for a new job for 2 years now.  Before that I ran my own business and before that I ran my own division with 20 people working for me.  Substantial by our industry's standard.  Unfortunately my business was too small to absorb the economic changes (we are entirely dependent on people buying or selling homes and/or condos), like a row boat crushed under the wave of a heavy squall.  Luckily my credit didn't take too much of a hit (I was the sole guarantor).  However, with the increase reservations of lending institutions, I cannot get enough capital to restart, even as former customers call for estimates. 
-9	negative	unemployment	I have been trying so hard lately to get a job. I really need money for a plane ticket in August. I have applied to soo many places that I've lost track of them all. And every time I have some hope I am let down. I've been trying hard :/ For some stupid reason barely any places hire under 18. Ugh. Why do I need to be 18 to sell clothes or roll a freaking burrito.? And all the places that do hire 16 and 17 years old aren't hiring right now -.- Does any one have any advice or anything.? I'm dying here.
-2	negative	unemployment	I have been unemployed for ages, and although I could do with the money, I'm not really looking for work. I have so many money making ideas, and the time to persue them that I'd feel trapped if I suddenly found myself in a job.So, yes unemployed, but I consider my life on standby rather than a mess.
-6	negative	unemployment	I have been unemployed for the past few months for the first time in my life.  I am debt up to my ears.  I owe a lot of money and now I am close to having the car repossessed and I am close to being out on the street.  I am looking for work but that has not worked out as of yet.  I need financial help immediately.  Can anyone help? I feel so helpless right now because I have been use taking care of everything.  I have no one to help me. I pray to God that I will see the light again.

-4	negative	unemployment	I have collected and received unemployment for one week.  I went to file online today and was told I need to have a telephone interview which will occur on 4/22/13.  I rec'd a notice today about my unemployment may be suspended due to misconduct.  Can anyone give advice for my phone interview?   I live in NJ>

-2	negative	unemployment	I have had a problem since infant school. I don't know what it is. It's driving me insane! 
-9	negative	unemployment	I have had trouble deciding what I want to be and eventually I told my mother that maybe I should just settle for nursing. I explore other career options but nursing and one other job seemed to be the right fit. But I prefer one job over the other even though I know it will be the harder route. I want to write, write movies to be exact. I want to share my ideas with people and create something that makes people mad, angry, moved to tears by sympathy or joy, I want to create something that people will enjoy watching. I don't know what to do with myself. Should I try and there be a possibility that I just fail? Or try and hope for the best instead of settling for nursing.
-1	negative	unemployment	I have lost two dogs and a cat in the past seven years and if you are in this group the word " beloved" says more than just a pet. These are family members we grieve for .so for me, and from me to all of you Special thanks to Hannah for the link to video.
-1	negative	unemployment	I haven't been happy for a long time. I guess it's my fault because I do what's best for everyone else but myself. I sit around miserably while tryin to make everyone else happy. I know I should just stop but I guess I'm afraid of the outcome.
-6	negative	unemployment	I havent worked since 01/2013. Unemployment is not cutting it.My kids are teens & i feel i have let them down becz i cant even provide new clothes/snacks 4 school.We have 2 shop at second hand clothing. Im a disappointment 2 my kids i see it.PRAY4ME 
-9	negative	unemployment	I have PTSD, and I have a lot of days that can be really sucky To everyone out there, I hope that you can wake up and fight the sads and get up and eat some breakfast and exercise or call a friend or read a good book or cuddle a pet. Everyone deserves happiness, even though its not always very easy to achieve. As one of my favorite bands said "it's not about being happy It's about not letting the sadness win".
-8	negative	unemployment	i have scars not only on my wrists, but all the way up my arms, stomach, legs, and thighs. all these scars that remind me of all the pain i feel. all these scars remind me of  memories i so badly want to forget, just making me want to add new cuts. nobody understand that cutting becomes an addiction, nobody understands the amount of pain we're in to feel like cutting is the only way we can get through the day. 
-6	negative	unemployment	I have struggled my whole life with money and when I met my boyfriend, I fell so much in love I just gave him all he wanted and got into a lot of debt. Please help me
-4	negative	unemployment	I hesitated with being an INTJ. I had to think about it more, to determine the truth. Because whatever why, it helps me.I tend to be attracted a lot to INTPs, other NF types. INTJs. Mostly all N types. 
-10	negative	unemployment	I just found out that my brother split up with his girlfriend and I feel so sad. She was like an older sister to me and we had a lot of good times together. I've just that I won't be able to spend fun times with her again and I am grieving over this loss. My brother and her broke up because their lives just didn't match or so he says. Is there any chance of them getting back together? I truly wanted her to be my sister-in-law because she's just absolutely an amazing, kind and sweet person.
-8	negative	unemployment	I just quit my job after being employed by the same employer for 21+ years.  My employer is a doctor.  He just kept pushing and pushing me.  I know he wanted me to quit because he didn't want to fire me.  He kept complaining how broke he is.  Never mind that he just bought a home that cost him almost 1 million, settled a divorce with wife #2, now has a new girlfriend who I knew she would be the end of my job and/or my other employees jobs.  I was his office manager.  I was very hard working and loyal to this doctor but no matter it did end up being me losing my job!!!! It has only been a few weeks but I feel like it has been forever.  I feel like I have gone through a divorce after working this many years for the same person.  Just feels very weird.  Totally depressing.
-3	negative	unemployment	I just try to be the best I can be
-13	negative	unemployment	I just want to say I'm so glad I don't know anyone here personally. Because I've been holding all this in for a while and I don't want a soul to know. Not only is this embarrassing, I'm very ashamed I let myself go so bad. I've always been a bigger body type. I'm italian so I'm so inlove with carbs and eating all the time. Ever since I was little I've always had a problem with my weight. In high school, I never weighted more than 180. Sophomore year, I lost a good 40 pounds and was the smallest I've ever been on high school. Fast forward two years after high school after being on birth control I now am 215. Mind you, I am 5ft 3. No one knows my weight. Not even my husband. I've found this book called "the omni diet" off amazon. I haven't started it yet but I'll update whenever it comes in the mail. 140 is my goal weight again. And I'm hoping to lose 45 by July. Let's keep our fingers crossed! Also, I love advice and tips! So please do so(:
-13	negative	unemployment	I just wonder what people think of me based on my profile here. I haven't uploaded any pictures of myself, because I enjoy the anonymity, however seeing as how my profile picture is of my own car I figure if any of my friends were on here & see it they'd know its me in a heartbeat so my profile picture is enough of an identity giveaway lol. I just hope that other people view me from my profile as the fun, outgoing and caring person I am. 
-5	negative	unemployment	I just wrote an article on surveys, and explained a little about them in case you are unemployed and looking for a little extra income.  I spend several hours each day with them and find that this is one of the most relaxing things you can do on the internet.  It's really a lot of fun and my wife has to pull me off the computer because you really don't want to stop when you see how much you have earned.  Good luck to everyone here on Experience Project and I hope this information helps! 
-3	negative	unemployment	I kicked my husband out a month ago for cheating and we are currently in the divorce process. I've already slept with someone else  and been asked on date but I feel more lonely than ever. I hate it. I have no one to talk to but my 2 year old and let's be honest, it's not exactly stimulating conversation. I feel like no one will like me because of my weight and situation in life.
-2	negative	unemployment	i lie compulsively but involuntarily i think. i dont mean to. i just go about it. its ruining my life. 
-5	negative	unemployment	I live in an area that has a high unemployment rate in the winter. I was laid off at the end of the summer, just before fall. And have been having a very hard time finding work, because jobs are hard to come by in my town in the winter. I have been looking for work outside my city. The experience of losing a steady employment is tough, especially during a low in the job market. I am sending out resumes daily, and hopeful that I will find employment soon. 
-6	negative	unemployment	I live my life complaining and wanting everything else that I can't have, making myself miserable with no reason. Another person could see my life as potential for a great life. I choose to live with what I have. I hope I can learn to love all of it.
-6	negative	unemployment	I'll will never again be the same happy, free-spirited, loveable girl I used to be. I'll always be afraid to love someone again because the world just might hate me enough to take him away again. No one can love someone who's broken. It's like broken toys, no little kid wants to play with it, and that's exactly what I am now. Just another broken toy.
-5	negative	unemployment	I lost my dad eight months ago. I've had to deal with a lot of "firsts" without him this year. First father's day, first birthday, first Thanksgiving and very soon will be the first Christmas. But I think the hardest first that I've had to face is my first big life decision.  I don't know I'll be able to make this decision without his input. 
-17	negative	unemployment	I lost my dad to cancer in 2012 and I have nearly lost all of my children to death . Two of my children have suffered depression and tried to take their own lives and thankfully I was there to prevent that happening. I have had a daughter who could have easily died in a house fire and a son who could have bled to death recently after a minor dental operation led to a cut artery and the most blood I have ever seen. It is traumatic the feeling of losing a loved one . It has made me face up to how much I love my family and how awful it would be to live this life without them. It has also shown me the importance of life and how precious life is. I now want to tell those that I love every day that I love them and appreciate the family and friends that I  have and every moment that we share together. 
-14	negative	unemployment	I lost my father when I was only a few months old. He died from an unexpected heart attack. I have no memories of him and I have never heard his voice. Occasionally I listen to stories from family members about what he was like, but all I have that's real is a few photos. Until recently I have never really stopped to think about how my life would have been different had he been around. I have never regarded myself as being different and I have never really felt sad about anything. I assume that because I never knew him, I never really had anything to feel sad about. Many thanks.
-10	negative	unemployment	I lost my Grandpa when I was only one years old, and I don't remember him at all. Right now what kills me the most, is my Grandma was diagnosed with cancer over a year ago, and there is no cure, it gets worse and worse. And I have to live everyday not knowing when she will breath her last breath. I am very close to my grandmother, andit hurts me deeply, and saddens me that I have to sit there as someone that I love is dying at front me, going through that pain and I can not do anything to help her. 
-4	negative	unemployment	I lost my job, involuntarily, on Monday this week. If anyone has any words of wisdom or knows of any jobs in California, my expertise is in Customer Service and Inside Sales, I would certainly appreciate it.
-11	negative	unemployment	I lost my job shortly after I began transitioning. In fact, I lost my job because they found out that I am transgendered and transitioning. I am no less intelligent, hard working, or a team plaSometimes I think that it wasn't such a bad thing, losing that job. I have never had a job where I had felt such hostility before, and I have worked in the prison system. The only time that I didn't have someone putting me down was when I went out on a call by myself. Our supervisor straight told me that he didn't want to hear it or deal with it. That was the worst environment that I had ever been forced to endure, thank the powers that be that it is over.
-12	negative	unemployment	I'm 27, and unfortunately had to file for bankruptcy right before my birthday. The process was long, just like any case, and I undoubtedly feel it was the best decision I could have made for myself. However, after bouncing around with jobs this year, I have had a huge struggle of landing a new job since the bankruptcy discharge. Prior to the discharge, any time I had a job interview, I was made an offer. However, since my bankruptcy has gone public, I have had a VERY hard time securing a job after an interview. I've had two with solid companies, both of which were very interested, who said "once we do the background check we will get in touch", to which I wake up every day with an empty voice mail. I appreciate any input. 
-1	negative	unemployment	I'm 32, currently unemployed, without money, without even a bank account. Seems like I'm constantly fighting against myself, can't seem to get started with anything, if I do get started I quickly lose focus and drive which sends me into a mental slump. Here I sit in hope, however slight it is. Hope is hard to kill off.

-12	negative	unemployment	I'm a 17 year old high school student that was just accepted to the Young Entrepreneurs for Leadership and Sustainability (YELS) summer program at the University of Florida. I really want to attend this program because it focuses on community service and sustainability, both which I'm very passionate about. Next year I'm going to apply to Cornell University, and this program will help me stand out because I will recieve college credit and it will show my interest in sustainability. The problem is that My mom isn't able to afford the $6,500 cost. I really want to go to this program, but the cost is too much and I need help. Whether you Donate or not, I thank you for taking the time to read this. God bless! 
-8	negative	unemployment	I'm a 31/f. I thought I would be settle in a career by this age when I graduated from University 10 years ago. I am so/very/extremely disappointed at myself for my zero accomplishment. I feel like I'm the only one among my school buddies that haven't had a change in my life for this ten precious years..I used to have a pretty good career path oversea but 3 years ago, I decided to return to where my parents live and spend more time with them. I, therefore, have to start my career all over againI worked for jobs that paid minimum, the job that I feel shameful or see no prospectI couldn't find anyone who I can talk to. I no longer have direction in life and feel very tired for the continuous hunt for a better job or meanings. I tend to associate my career as my direction in life. I want to be needed. I feel so empty when I have no direction. I feel like a spinning compass
-2	negative	unemployment	Im a bit stuck with my life I dont really have any big problems, Im 25 years old and I have no big record of failures in my past, my present is quite perfect in all aspects of my life, and I dont see any trouble having a nice future only thing is: it just doesnt feel right, I lack of a purpose, I dont really have any passion about anything, and my ordinary days seem to go day by day, week by week, month by month without any real thrill, Im bored with my life and Im struggling to find a way to burst through this lack of passion and purpose. Any one has been through this and have any tips that you could lend me for a change?
-8	negative	unemployment	I made a bad choice in my life, and need help getting home to my kids. They are 21, 18, 13, and 12. I have nothing to sell, just need gas money and money to get insurance on my car to get there. I am desperate to find someone with enough compassion to help me get to my babies. I have a place to stay once I get home, and a job lined up and waiting, I just need the help to get there. God bless you from the bottom of my heart and soul. Words cannot express how deeply I long to hold my babies again, how I dream of being there for them again, I have joint custody, but just cannot get home to live and help in their everyday lives that I so long to do. I do not drink, nor do I do drugs. I am a 44 year old female who just needs a little help to get her life back on track. Bless you. 
-5	negative	unemployment	I made my first day of unemployment in pretty good shape. I felt horrible yesterday but today is a good day. Had a conversation with the old boss and she said that she didn't think I'd walk out but guess what.enough is enough! I've felt bullied long enough! I'm free and BROKE! Not able to get me back but offered a great severance that puts my mind temporarily at ease. Day 1 - done!
-11	negative	unemployment	I'm a housewife and I'm bored to death!  I don't work because I'm disabled and I hate it, because I've worked my whole life.  I have anxiety and depression and it makes very difficult for me to hold a job or maintain relationships.  But, I tried hard to build a life for myself until I just couldn't do it anymore. I've always taken care of myself and I find it humiliating to have to ask my husband for money or wait for a check every month.  I'm a grown capable woman, I shouldn't have to ask my husband for money to get my hair or nails done.  My husband  never makes me feel like a burden.  He always says that what's his is mine and that he loves me.  He promised my mom that he'll always take care of me and he has.  I just wish that I could contribute more financially.
-13	negative	unemployment	Im am not perfect yes i know . It really isn't something new to me . No ones perfect , oh you didnt know? Even people with the beautiful faces are most dangerous. People just don't want to understand it infact all people like to do is go for what is BEAUTIFUL . But i know im not perfect but atleast i try to , atleast i try to be nice to everyone even my enimies , because im trying. Atleast i dont bully people because they have problems. Atleast i try right? Yeah i lie everyone lie . Im only 14 im still so young. I know im not perfect so stop saying that. Because i try..
-6	negative	unemployment	I'm an educated, independent, caring woman.  This economy has taken such a blow to my finances the last year or so.  I am not here to scam anyone, I treat others how I want to be treated. I've donated money in the past when able.  I refuse to get credit cards to pay for things; they only put you in a worse financial situation eventually.  I'm going to get right to it, if anyone is at all capable of sending any amount of money to me to help myself and my daughter, it would be GREATLY APPRECIATED.  Peace to all.
-11	negative	unemployment	I'm a survivor of self harming Yet in not fully recovered I first started a few years ago. I tried stop but soon came addicted to it. I felt like that was the only thing that could make me feel alive yet it is still. I have scars, and I'm not proud of them. One day in math, someone pointed them out in front of the whole class.. That was probably the most embarrassing thing that has happened yet this year And after he said it, everyone looked at me different. Which really hurt even more. People tried grabbing my arm to see and I just felt so trapped. I started a new form of hurting myself. I'd snap my pony tail against my wrist. And not very much longer, it'd start to bleed. I'm not proud, but I'm trying to stop. You become so addicted to it, it's normal. It makes me feel like I'm alive, yet I know I shouldn't. But what happens when that's the only thing that you know that is keeping you from slipping and drowning down deep into the dark ocean??
-2	negative	unemployment	I'm currently a stay at home mom and I hate not having my own money. Does anyone know any online sites that you can actually make good money from?
-2	negative	unemployment	what did you the torch was for?
-3	negative	unemployment	I missed my cat so much. No other cat was like her, and she has chosen me.
-10	negative	unemployment	I miss you when I don't hear from you in days!  You have become my rock, my best friend, and my biggest supporter. I know we have never met face to face but you always know how to put a big smile on my face.  Even though he threw me away like I was trash you never turned your back on me and I love you for that.  I don;t care what anybody thinks you are a beautiful person on the inside and out.
-4	negative	unemployment	I'm living with and being supported by a close relative. I need to find some kind of employment to support myself. I will work on that. I will first try people I know who have their own small businesses.
-2	negative	unemployment	I'm not perfect i never claimed to be because there's no such thing.
-8	negative	unemployment	I'm not racist really! However, having been unemployed now for 1 year and seeing for my own two eyes how the job situation in my town is, I feel I have to speak. Yes we all know that this is an OPEN DOOR country! But that does not help the fact. It almost certainly adds to it. Now as if things weren't bad enough with half the joke shop i.e: job center being foreign. Now I have to attend a work program hosted by an Asian. How humiliating this is for a 40 year old. Good for her she has a job, but don't rub it in my face. This obviously causes friction between races. I feel this country is Fd !! With NO hope of ever recovering.How might it be in another country?? I dread to think!! Thank you England for making me feel like I and millions of others feel. LET DOWN&lt; LOST&lt; BURNT&lt; ETC!!  
-3	negative	unemployment	I'm shy. I've got scars. I've been heartbroken. I've lied. I've done things I'm NOT proud of. But I'm NOT perfect.
-3	negative	unemployment	I'm so complicated person!it likes there're 2 people in me.And that make me so uncomfortable
-1	negative	unemployment	I'm tired of beans a monster. I am tired of being able to walk out in 30 below temperatures and be just fine. I am tiredbbeing a creature ice and cold. I just don't feel that froze numbness in my soul anymore. I have tried so incredibly hard to be more than what I am. I can't even be who I was meant to be.
-5	negative	unemployment	I'm waiting to start college in a few months and live with my boyfriend who is always at school or busy. Having bad anxiety and being at home all day with no distractions is not the best thing in the world. Just left with sad thoughts on repeat. My brain is horrible. And when I do get human interaction from my bf he makes my anxiety/depression worst.
-22	negative	unemployment	I'm writing to see if someone can help me. I lost my daughter in a car wreck and then my husband shortly thereafter. I was working and had an accident at work that left me unable to do the job anymore. i have tried to keep myself going , but have had some Dr. and hospital bills that are causing me setbacks. I am hoping that someone can help me to pay off my house, or help me get the motgage paid ahead so i don't have so many bills. My bill is over $52,000 for the mortgage. I could pay bvack, but not he big payment I make now. God has said that he will help those in need and who come to him in paryer,so I'm praying that someone can help me here. Thank you for at least reading my request. God Bless,
-2	negative	unemployment	In April I lost my job as an entertainment lawyer. It was my dream job. I had been working towards this my whole life. Now I can't even get my foot in the door at other companies. I'm either overly qualified for paralegal position or under qualified for attorney positions. I had to move back home. So now I'm 29, broke, in debt, single and living at home. It can only go up from here right?
-14	negative	unemployment	I need help and while I feel like we have everything we could want, the one thing we don't seem to have enough of is money. My husband just got paid recently for one of his power plant projects he worked on three years ago. Yes, it really does take that long to get paid because we have to wait out the warranty period. So our finances are stable right now but as soon as he got paid, it seemed like all our vehicles broke down simultaneously. For August, the expense for one vehicle was $2,154.52. In July, we spent $1,900 on another vehicle and now it's showing new signs of more issues - possibly transmission. Our monthly income is around $5,200. Not a whole lot left  since food is usually $400/mo. We do not go out often. 
-6	negative	unemployment	I need help paying my electric bill. Its due today or will be shut off. Im not asking anyone to give me money directly. Im not trying to scam anyone. You can go to green Mountain energy website. Im located in texas. My user name is eruiz11 and pw is R0B9X7T7. You will see im not lying about it being due. Please help on there with any amount. Please anyone who can help. Dont do it for me but for my kids. May God bless you! 
-2	negative	unemployment	I need to make some cash to pay rent for me and my girlfriend while I am working and attending college. I am not looking for a hand out but will work for the extra money. Please feel free to email me and let me know how YOU could be a help.
-2	negative	unemployment	I never met my mum se died giving birth to me :'(
-1	negative	unemployment	I never thought or will be perfect . I have very low self esteem and I hate when I try to be or look like somebody I'm not but I only do it to let people know I'm here but why can't they see me ? I don't get bullied but I do get talked about I guess this is just what happens in high school .
-4	negative	unemployment	I never understood where all my emotions and feelings came from, until somebody turned on the light. After that I became a completely different person. I love the new me 
-2	negative	unemployment	I no longer know how to be happy. Everything I do is just a plain "OK". Nothing makes me feel good, nothing is satisfying anymore. I feel like I'm missing something really important in my life. I just want to be loved and feel important  is it too much to ask?
-11	negative	unemployment	In the beginning my now husband was very sweet always opening the door for me and always putting me before everything else. There was a time i actually felt like he loved me. After he came home from Iraq he was a different man. He always proceeded to make me cry, to put me down, and to threaten to beat me so hard that i would not be able to get back up. He was never like that in the beginning. Only after coming home from overseas. To this day he still threatens me and puts me down as well as belittle me and make me feel worthless. But, Although i love my husband i do not like the way he treats me. I know that i deserve better but when you have been with someone so long and you have a child with them it makes it that much harder to leave them.
-9	negative	unemployment	I obtained my Bachelor's Degree in 2007 and soon after became a Substitute Teacher and tutor to work through grad school. Today, I am not even a tutor anymore. I was laid off the same week I found out my wife would be expecting our first child and I find myself still clutching to faint hopes of validation from academia. It isn't at all settling to feel that there are no simple answers to my present situation only the glimmer that as they say, "there's nowhere to go but up."
-5	negative	unemployment	I really miss my mom. She passed away a few months ago. People are all like then why are you posting it? My dad cries a lot and I'm the only one in the family thats still strong. Mom took care of me and helped me with my bad dreams. My birthday here is fake, I'm actually 10. It's just that I can't tell anyone but I really need too. Here, I relate to people who have the same part of a story as I do. My mother died from a uncommon not contagious disease. Its not known like cancer or something. I really miss her.
-1	negative	unemployment	I really miss my mom. She was 48, had me when she was 24. I'm 26, she passed when I was 23. I miss her, I want to tell her I love her.
-6	negative	unemployment	I recently have lost 6 jobs in a row, some have only even lasted a week or two and they are always for the same reason and it's always due to my performance. I have never previously been fired from a job and this has only recently started happening and I don't think it's entirely work related but it's pretty paranoid to be feeling like the whole of the employment world is out to get me right. How can I turn this in to a positive when my resume is starting to loo very strange!
-4	negative	unemployment	I recently heard back from a job. It was a fast process. Phone interview and the next day they emailed me to let me know they were going in a different direction. I felt unsure after the call, so in a way I expected it. But I also just feel disappointed in myself. And without a job, it's hard to make friends in the actual world. I kind of feel terribly useless.
-9	negative	unemployment	I recently lost my kitten Gisu. She was my little baby. She was often getting sick and I would nurse her back to health. But one day she got this big lump on her neck that turned out to be an abscess and it burst open and it was very painful. We couldn't afford to take her to the vet and when we tried they turned us down because we had no money. The wound became necrotic and killed her. It was very painful to watch my baby pass away.
-6	negative	unemployment	I see a lot of hokey stories on here , sounds like half of them are just people who have nothing better to do then sit around and complain, i can say that because i use to be one of those people.  Traci 
-11	negative	unemployment	I seriously need to change! Its one of my top greatest things I want to achieve this year. It may take a lot of time, but at least Im ready to do it. Im ready to face life. I want to get out from this isolation Ive been experiencing. I want to feel and see what life really is (of course, in a good way). I want to make my life exciting and fun. I want to laugh a lot because last year wasnt that good to me. I want to spend time with the people I knew and as well I want to meet new ones.  I want to do what my heart has been tellling me to do. I just want to be myself, to express myself naturally without any fear or pretentions. I hope and pray it'll happen before this year ends. May God be with me, always.
-6	negative	unemployment	I shared seven short, sweet years with Emma. I lost my Emma, but I am the one who feels alone. She lies in an eternal dreamy sleep and I'm part of a waking nightmare. Together for short lives.
-4	negative	unemployment	I share more about myself online than in person. I find it difficult to share some things in person, even to my closest friends. It's just a lot easier to type some things out and have my friends read that.  
-10	negative	unemployment	Isn't it heartbreaking that someone should be on the streets at Christmas ? It's bad enough any other time but at this season where happy families are bustling all over the place overladen with shopping bags and so much love and happiness in the air but they can only look through the windows of shops and be left out in the cold. I imagine poverty and homelessness is a very lonely affair . And in the spirit of Christmas I gave him 10 to buy Christmas dinner , way more than I usually can spare , but it's Christmas and that one little gesture he did , wearing that uniform really touched me , talk about smiling while enduring difficult circumstances.
-5	negative	unemployment	It has been a while since I have posted anything I guess things were good for a while but now we are back to square one again. 
-7	negative	unemployment	I think if a guy hits a women or girl they are a fvcking biotch. Okay girls dont deserve to be hit. Men are stronger than girls it can really hurt them physically and emotionally. Getting hit by a guy hurts like fvck. And especially hurts when they say mean stuff after they hit you. They say those mean actions right at your face. So stop hiting or hurting girls. They are more sensitive. Just fvck off! No one wants to be hit. And guys have bigger fist so they can break a girls face. No one wants blood or tears on the floor so pls stop abusing. And if they are your wife an u abuse her im gonna fvcking kill the sh*t out of you. So plz stop the hate!!
-6	negative	unemployment	I think the worst feeling in the world is watching the person you love love someone else. That use to be me.. I don't think I've ever felt so sad.
-4	negative	unemployment	I think this is me I make things complicated, I want to run away. It's not easy to love me
-1	negative	unemployment	I thought it was over. It wasn't. And now here I am a mess all over again. I just didn't expect for it to take me so long to put the pieces back together.
-1	negative	unemployment	I thought I was loved. But he manipulated me and lied to me and used me until I broke. He turned me into everything I hate. I hate myself. I isolate myself. I don't trust anyone and I'm spiteful. He's turned my best friend against me. She now lies to my face and I can't trust her. I have no one left. I can't talk to my family because I'm afraid of getting beaten again. I don't know what to do.
-2	negative	unemployment	It kinda consumes me, but I like the way it feels to be honest. 
-3	negative	unemployment	I told myself if I didn't do anything I could cut at midnight on New Year's Eve. I celebrate 2014 with 2,014 cuts across the thigh, euphoric if you ask me.
-3	negative	unemployment	I try to not be as critical on myself but it is difficult. I now exercise and eat much healthier than I used to. I went from being told to loose weight because I was getting close to becoming obese to lean muscle. Still have to work on the mental image though.
-3	negative	unemployment	It's actually a wonderful feeling when I'm alone. Not that I'm a compete introvert, but for me finding clarity and a peace of mind includes being alone a lot of the time
-9	negative	unemployment	It's been almost 7 months since losing my husband in a very unexpected helicopter crash, and I believe I entered a new realm of grief a few weeks ago. Last week was my 39th B-day, and unfortunately I got married on the B-day. Didn't see this coming when I picked the date. I'm spending my weekends searching the saddest songs written. Burning CD's that actually say, top 10 widow picksmy husband was the most, interesting, man alive. He was a prince. If men were money, I  won the lottery, and now I'm bankruptwtf
-3	negative	unemployment	Its been two occassions now that I was sexting guys and others around them had seen my pictures. I was just glad I didn't have my face in them but I still got mad anyways and now I'm gonna stop forever.
-6	negative	unemployment	It's boring beyond belief because there's nothing to do, no one to hang out with and no money to do those things you want to do like go to a cafe or have a drink.  You can't join sports teams or clubs because you can't afford to get there, let alone take part.  Even if you do go most people don't want to talk to you because as soon as you say you're unemployed they either offer their condolences and walk away or they lecture you about lazy unemployed people and walk away.  Either way, they won't talk to you again except to be polite.   No one loves unemployment.  I hate being unemployed.  I want a job so I can have my dignity back but no one wants a 42 year old with a patchy work history.
-3	negative	unemployment	Its just become clear to me I regret every lover I've had. Of which there are a short list. None of them were good enough for me. None of them deserved my affections even a little.
-6	negative	unemployment	Its not fair that i have BPD and MDD and cant hold down a job. Ive worked at 10 different places and failed miserably every time because i cant control my emotions and depression at all even with meds and therapy. Im working on getting disability right now but in the mean time im going to lose my car and my home. I will be homeless and most likely kill myself. I need help but theres nothing else i can do, nobody can help me. Today i woke up at 7:30 am crying, depressed and suicidal, this is an everyday thing with me. Im on antidepressants and anti psychotics and attend my therapy sessions regularly but im still a failure and im not getting any better. I also am going to lose my bf soon because he cant deal with me anymore, hes my only hope of survival. Please, i need some good advice something that could help me
-3	negative	unemployment	It was in 2010. As the weather is getting chilly, it reminds me him and me in UK, and the SF.
-18	negative	unemployment	It was in the fall, we were busy at work transitioning two big contracts from prototype to full on MFG. I had been under the weather for a few weeks, I thought I had pneumonia, but test at the Dr's showed negative. I went to see my Dr. 6 times in 10 weeks. I was getting weaker and having trouble concentrating at work. I decided I needed to get healthy. I was overdue an outpatient surgery for carcinoid tumors in my stomach. I really wanted that one overwith. So I took four days off work. During this week, the office was being remodeled. I kept getting calls to "move your stuff to your new location". I was sick, and weak, so I told my boss to just have my stuff moved to my Lab., and I would take care of it when I got in.
-4	negative	unemployment	It wasn't like it usually is; playing and singing for an audience.  It wasn't like just playing the chords and singing at the right moments.  It was like watching my soul bleed in front of God and everybody as if I wasn't even there.  The moment a song dreams of, and the singer dreads.  It was naked.  It was good.  It was home.
-9	negative	unemployment	I used to always feel like good and bad days took turns coming throughout the year, but I've learned something that really moved me. I've learned that there are no good or bad days given to us. Each day is the same, and it just depends on how we want live through the day. It's something to really think about
-10	negative	unemployment	I used to be a follower and was controlled by everyone around me. I hated being different, but when I realized doing that was keeping me from being happy, I changed completely. I told everyone I was going to be myself an stop trying to act like the person they all wanted to be. I have a lot of friends now who accept me for me, and only one friend, my boyfriend,is exactly like me. I wish to meet more people like us *hippiesalltheway
-6	negative	unemployment	I used to be a functioning alcoholic.  I used to go out and party with my co workers every night then go into work hung over. It was not pretty.  I also used to be a really mean person. But then I realized that the place I was working was teaching me these bad habits, so I quit that job and got a new one where I was a lot happier and I wasn't being peer pressured into drinking. 
-4	negative	unemployment	I used to be a victim of this. You have to get out of it no matter how much you think you love them.
-4	negative	unemployment	I've always been afraid of sunflowers. They give me the creeps. They give me goose bumps. I think they're ugly. I always have. I just think because I have an overactive imagination, growing up I always thought the middle would turn into a pencil sharpener and eat my face. Plus the middle is so I don't know. Ew. I just really am repulsed by them.
-6	negative	unemployment	I've always been very open to experiences. Drugs are no exception. I'm a very curious individual. I'm no stranger to drug  experimentation. I've pretty much tried it all. I enjoy drugs. I enjoy being outside of my usual mind. But I wouldn't want to live everyday under the influence. I've never let it develop into an addiction. It wouldn't be fun anymore. I just feel that recreational users get judged too harshly. People seem to think that if you do drugs you are automatically an addict and you need help. I'm living proof that those are false allegations. I take care of myself. I don't do drugs everyday. I don't blow all my money on it. And I have all of my teeth. It hasn't ruined my life. It's a guilty pleasure. We all have those. I'm not ashamed.
-8	negative	unemployment	I've always struggled with money. I'm only 18 now and there's always been one thing I've returned to time and time again, making money online. I've spent some of my free time doing this and I've managed to make over $800 with it. It's pretty quick and easy if you've got a computer at home and need money then I definitely reccomend you try it. Click below for more info about it: 
-5	negative	unemployment	I've been in a abusive relationship and it was awful. It started out as a single slap and ended with burns, cuts, and throwing me down stairs and into walls. I took it for a while because I was too scared to break up with him. That was one of the worst decisions I've ever made. If anyone is in an abusive relationship, please get out of it as soon as you can. You'll regret it later.
-1	negative	unemployment	I've been spending time on myself - getting a ps3 to learn how to play games like a pro/ 
-4	negative	unemployment	I've been through a physical relationship for 8 months. It's been handled but the idea of "he's going to change" - it's not gonna happen. It's difficult emotionally still today, and respect is lost for men who think hitting inappropriately is acceptable
-3	negative	unemployment	I've had nine knee surgeries and two C-sections. My knee joint literally crumbled apart so I had a total knee replacement last year at 37 years old. I really hate that scar, but I am very thankful I can still walk. 
-2	negative	unemployment	I've lost two family members to cancer. One of my aunts and one of my uncles. Recently, another aunt has been diagnosed. Its spread too far too quickly and they don't think she'll make it much longer.  I almost don't want her to, its hard to see her in so much pain. I'd love to see her reunited with her brother and sister, free of any pain.
-1	negative	unemployment	I've made mistakes. I'm so very sorry for my mistakes. I regret my mistakes. That's my goal 
-5	negative	unemployment	I've struggled to find a permanent job since leaving university. I've done a few temporary jobs here and there, but they've not worked out or were short term fixed deals. I do volunteer work one or two days a week though, which I enjoy despite not earning money.  I'm just an honest guy trying to find work and make a good living. I sign on and claim welfare, but I don't try and get more than I'm entitled to and never would. It's not something I'm proud of it by any means, but it's my only choice at this moment in time. I'd rather work and earn money from that opposed to living on benefits, just the majority of people in this position.
-1	negative	unemployment	I want to manage a no-kill animal shelter. 
-14	negative	unemployment	I was 2 or 3 at the time. It was summer and I was playing with a big purple ball while my mom was sweeping. The broom didn't have a handle and was sharp. Anyway I threw the ball against a wall and it got stuck in this little thing that had 4 boards built around it. I ran to get it and something scraped me just above the eye! My mom thought she hit me with the end of the broom! She is really overprotective and not good in a crisis!! So she ran in got a towel but it over my head and sat me on her lap in the car a started driving. She was shaking and almost got a police car and drove up on the side walk!! LOLZ! Once we got to the E.R. And checked in and all that crap the numbed my head and put in 4 stitches. We had to wait after they were in like 30 mins for some  reason. So my mom took me to the car to get another price of candy and the nurse yelled get back in here you can't leave!!  That's my story sorry it was really long!
-2	negative	unemployment	I was abruptly terminated from my job of nearly seven years.  The reason given was that the organization fosters a work place ba 
-19	negative	unemployment	I was angry when my mom went into the hospital. I argued with her and didn't say what I should've told her and one night we found out that she was being kept alive by machines and I realized it was to late to tell her I loved her and that she was my biggest hero. She battled cancer for 1 year 4 months and 5 days. I never thought about how it would end but I guess at the time I didn't care. I should have let her know how I felt. At the end she didn't know who I was and seeing her like that made me feel dead inside, I hated everything, I couldn't make it in school. All I could think about was all the things I didn't tell her. When we took her off machines I tried to say goodbye but it wasn't right she didn't know me, she wasn't my mother. I would give anything to apologies for acting like I did and to let her know all the things I should have said. But it's too late.
-9	negative	unemployment	I was at my last job for 10 years. My ex-boss and I got along pretty well with my boss, and co-workers. Then, a couple of years ago, a new grad started. This little sh*t started brown-nosing boss-lady. My boss started then acting strangely towards me. A year later, a vacancy was available at work, and one of her ex-college mates was hired immediately. So now, there were two brown-nosers, working together. My ex-boss' treatment towards me began to get worse and worse, and I was told who was putting negative ideas in her head, by another person in the department.  These horrible people pushed me out to get the friend in.
-10	negative	unemployment	I was diagnosed with PTSD about 3 years ago.  I have a great therapist and I work with him weekly to overcome my depression, anxiety and fears. I have had a long list of stressful, painful, fearful and painful experiences starting from when I was a young child and all through my adult life. I struggle with isolation, depression, anger, anxiety, nightmares, dissassociation and other symptoms. Sometimes I feel that I can't go on but my therapist has helped me to cope with my worst days and to look forward to a future where I will be happy and comfortable with my slef and my life. I hope and pray that others who cope with this disaorder can seek out support and make positive changes in their lives too. If I can help by listening, offering positive support or encouragment please turn to me.
-20	negative	unemployment	I was diagnosed with PTSD in 2009 after I was shot by my ex boyfriend and then watched him kill himself. I was one of those people who believed only soldiers could get something like that. Boy was I ever wrong I have nightmares, sweats, daymares ( lol ), insomnia, anger with no cut off point. The list could really go on. I never really knew how bad it was until I started seeing my ex everywhere, everything people said were like words coming out of his mouth. I replayed that night countless times. I became another personI haven't been the same since. The person I am now is ready to battle the world if I have to. I think I'm mad all the time. I do have problems being at home alone and in places alone full of strangers. At times I feel like one of my children, needing someone to hold their hand. I constantly think and feel like someone is after me. There is not a day that goes by that I don't. I've enrolled in college, but my daily battle isn't going to let me go I don't belive.
-7	negative	unemployment	I was hired for my first job ever a few months. Without any previous experience, everyone was very impressed that I landed a job at a fancy local retail store. I worked very hard and got along well with most of my co-workers.  I can admit I was nowhere close to perfect and did make mistakes, but I tried incredibly hard and was great with customers.  Sorry for such a long story! I needed to vent. This has been one of the worst fridays in quite some time. That is all 
-12	negative	unemployment	I was homeless and it's hard to be homeless I still feel like I'm homeless I was homeless 13-18 years old. But when I was little I was in foster care I felt I was homeless because I had to take care if myself I had to be an adult in a early age I never had a childhood or be a teenager because I had to survive no one help me I had to do it on my own and Im still am doing it on my own. A homeless shelter is alright I went there before lots of times you have food and water and clothes on your back and you take showers everyday just don't be with the wrong crowd or anything.
-10	negative	unemployment	I was medically discharged from the Royal Navy in April 2011 due to a back injury. I was only 23 (I am 25 now, been nearly 2 years) at the time so I decided to enrol in university to complete the final year of my degree (I got a FdEng in the Navy). Between April and September I couldn't get anything, only 1 interview and they looked green when they saw me with a walking stick (the agency forgot to mention it to them). I am registered disabled, I thought I should add that there. In the September I started at uni and graduated this year (July 201 with a First Class Bachelors Degree (Honours) in Mechanical Engineering. Despite this, I can't seen to get a job. I have been told my agencies that I have more qualifications than they know what to do with, yet it doesn't seem to matter, people wont hire me with my back in the state its in. I have been told by companies to contact them when my back is sorted as I am getting surgery in the new year.  R
-9	negative	unemployment	I was only six when I lost my grandpa but his death tore my entire family apart and we're still struggling with it. He went in one of the worst ways possible. Back when he was a kid he'd received some kind of treatment for really bad seasonal allergies that involved radiation around the sinuses. When he was about 55, he ended up with a tumor in that area and it got so much worse from there. He was so kind and patient and strong throughout it all though. I barely remember him but he's still a huge part of my family
-7	negative	unemployment	I was out of work for a year and my unemployment was running out.  I had to take the first job I was offered.  The problem is the job requires me to do things I find morally objectionable.  I am always a mess at work and my coworkers hate me.  On Friday my boss said they are going to have to take the situation under consideration and decide what to do.  I am still in my first 90 days.  I know most would say to just quit or be glad If I get fired but its not that easy when you have nothing to fall back on and no unemployment left.
-2	negative	unemployment	I was raised in a household of 4 women and I can't understand how guys think they have the right to do that to women. I'm probably closer to the women in my life rather than the men and treat them with the utmost respect. Any guy who does differently is an idiot
-8	negative	unemployment	I was so close being bankruptcy. I had trouble trying to find a job in my trade so I been living off a credit card so I can live. Sometimes living off gov't money . I was so close losing everything as I almost was not able to make those credit card payments. Finally I found a job in my trade in summer 2011 that pays well.   To date, I now owe $19,000.  Maybe you can get as lucky as me. But but do me a favor if you do get debt consolidation, try not to get into new debt that you don't need. I take it a step further. I take advantage of the rewards programs that haves no fees. I put my living expenses on those card and pay it off right way to get free stuff and pay no interest 
-7	negative	unemployment	I went from high school drop out smoking weed every hour of the day, to getting a high school diploma through home schooling myself, back to drug using to working construction, cnc machining, to warehouse jobs. And i said enough and enough and started aiming my goals Real high, i got through the first interview at an advertising/marketing company, and now I'm going back for a full day I guess it's about never stopping your momentum and knowing who's there for you and who to leave behind. Life is great! I couldn't have done it without her!
-7	negative	unemployment	I will be finished with college May 2014 with a Bachelor's degree in Mass Communication: Advertising and double minoring in Art and General Psychology. It will have taken me four years to earn my degree and gaining $27,000 in debt every year. I know eventually I will (hopefully) pay off that debt but my main concern is being able to afford life after college and before finding a stable job. I typically have way too much pride to ask for help but it is becoming more and more overwhelming and I just want to prove to my family that I can be an independent adult and take care of myself.  If you have the ability to help me, I would be extremely grateful! I wish I could do it by myself but I am putting my pride aside to ask for help.  
-1	negative	unemployment	I will live debt free.  I don't want my children to ever know what it is like to live in debt, live with debt.   I will live free from all the above
-23	negative	unemployment	I will never forget being bullied by this boy who was in my class. We are going to call him t and honestly if he was here I would ask him why did he used to bully me all the time. I didnt do anything to him nor did i speak to him, he just bullied me for no reason. he did it elementary school to partly middle school. I knew that he was not doing so well at home and that he was into violence but what made me get picked on alot. He picked on me so bad that until this day I want to get revenge on him. I know that it is a long time that we havent seen each other but I really want to hurt him like he hurted me. And worst of all he never got in trouble for picking with me, he just had warnings and then kept picking and picking. 
-1	negative	unemployment	I wish I could tell him how much I miss him. He says that we are  still friends but then - I can feel this barrier between us. Like no matter how hard I try to make it work - it just doesn't. I still miss him after all these years, but then I believe that at the start of the new year - I should make an effort not to miss him so much. I don't know how I will do it, but I guess anything is worth a try. 
-3	negative	unemployment	I wonder if emotions are like web strands we can connect to the world through.
-6	negative	unemployment	I work part time after being unemployed for over ten years. Unfortunately I also suffer from an incurable disease so I receive mobility part of dla ,child and working tax credits. I applied for housing benefit.  The benefits office has decided to work my housing benefit going back ten years including loans I took while taking a degree course. Now my rent plus council tax works out at 256 a week. I have been crying a lot because I don't want to go back on the dole. I thought doing this job might set me up for a full time job one day. I want to be a role model for my 12 year old daughter. Some times I feel like running away but to where? I don't want to let my daughter down. 
-3	negative	unemployment	Jan. 10. Fear. Do not be too timid and squeamish about your actions. All life is an experiment. The more experiments you make the better. What if they are a little coarse, and, you may get your coat soiled or torn? What if you do fail, and get fairly rolled in the dirt once or twice? Up again; you shall never be so afraid of a tumble.

I have worked since I was 15 years of age and never experienced this before. Today has got to be the worst day for me, my mind wonders to whats the point of going on with this life that seems so crazy.

-6	negative	unemployment	Living in fear is not something anyone wants to do. Especially when it comes to finances. Not having the money to pay rent. Not having the money to pay for schooling. Not having the money for transportation. Not having the money to purchase food. Not having money to provide for your family You work hard, day after day, only to have to spend your hard earned money on bills and taxes, not being able to afford the things you need I just thought to share my experience, as it is not just me who can attain this goal, but anyone with the will to do so, and quite frankly, I want to be the one to help anyone who needs it. Just ask me about it, I'd love to help you out ^_^

-1	negative	unemployment	Men should never hit a women. Even if the woman attacks you first. I've heard the whole " if she wants to act like a man I'll treat her like a man" A woman should be treated like a woman at all times. Take her to the ground and restrain her or avoid the confrontation all together and run.

I was out of town for medical reasons and our husky is known to jump a lot so we took her to a pet day care center where we told them she loved to jump and they said don't worry we can handle it, and what happens they lose her and she ends up getting hit by a car. She was everything she was such a loving dog! I miss her.
-10	negative	unemployment	My boyfriend of six years graduated college a year and a half ago with a BA in graphic design. This was the summer of 2012, then he took the rest of the summer off. I started asking him when he was going to start work, then stated he wanted to re-do his portfolio. Me being a graphic designer (still in school) my self can completely understand that. My bf needs to start work so I can finish school. But its so hard to get him to do his work. It's been a complete strain on our relationship. I'm beginning to feel like his mother. And I can't help but to focus on how selfish he's being. I don't know what to do, he's all I have.

Throughout the years, he has come and gone until about three years ago he and I finally settled into a true, fully committed relationship. I miss him. I miss who I used to be too. I will write more later once I get the courage. 
-23	negative	unemployment	My husband is addicted to pain pills. He sometimes will take up to 20 or more a day. He sometimes snorts them or eats them crushed to get in his system faster. It started out for pain but i think he likes the high more than needed for pain. He is spending up around 500.00 or more a month on getting more than his prescripton. He doesnt work and now is so depressed that he doesnt do anything but lay around. Im not sure if the depression is from all the pills or that not having enough. I have helped him get more for so long out of guilt. I didnt want him to be in pain plus he makes me believe he hates me or its my fault. Finally i took all the money we have left and hid it. He just went thru 90 in 4 days and now has none. I refuse to get him more this time. He says he is just going to go thru the withdrawls until he can get more. I want to call his doc but im afraid of what will happen. This is way out of control.

-5	negative	unemployment	My material life wants me to pursue a career buy a house and a car and get married. But I am least interested in all that. My family would get a shock of their life if I told them I want to go to the Himalayas and live there permanently.  Can't change a thing. Any suggestions?
-12	negative	unemployment	My mom passed away feb. 5 2010. this year I am graduating from high school and I miss her so much she I was not there for my first date or junior prom. it hurts all the time I hate hearing about how much other people hate their mom and I just want to get up and yell at least you have a mom!!!! some times I just want a hug from her and I want her to say everything is going to be ok because it never feels like it is going to be ok. I feel like I get hit wit h new waves of pain and hurt every turn or step I take. I feel so sad all the time I mean she wont get to see what have and will achieve.

-7	negative	unemployment	My name is Emilie, I am 33 years old and severely overweight at 248 pounds. My struggle with obesity affects many things in my life, but most recently it has been a major financial detriment. After being laid off, it has been extremely difficult for me to find a new job, and Im beginning to realize that my appearance may be the primary factor of my lack of success in getting hired. A friend took notice to my recent financial struggles and suggested that i sign up for online surveys to make some money from home. So far this has been holding me over while I continue to search for work. It really is a great thing and also contributes to important research on obesity. I signed up at inspiredopinions.com and thought that I would share with you all that there are options, and that this is a great one.  All the best, Emilie.
-3	negative	unemployment	My name is Jerrica and I'm 20 years old. Like most of you, I've been lying nearly my entire life. It started when I was little and just snowballed into something much, much bigger. 
-1	negative	unemployment	My name is shawn and I am very nice and shy I am shawn almost all the time but sometimes Daniel comes out and takes over my body he is the smart one and the sporty one to, but he hardly ever comes out during school when I most need him
-1	negative	unemployment	My older brother is a homeless person.
-1	negative	unemployment	My one and only big brother. My hero. My childhood best friend. It is so hard to get up in the morning knowing I will never see him again and even though it has almost been a year and a half i am completely broken without him. It gets hard to breathe when I hear his name and I wake up with tears running down my face every single night. I would do anything to have my big brother back because this hurts so bad.  
-4	negative	unemployment	My step sister isn't my cup of tea. She's always trying to make me jealous of her and she always has to rub the slightest things in. I'm not one to get jealous anyway but she's so competitive and even tries hurting me if she lost against me at something. I don't know whether to tell her about all my lovely holidays over the past to make her jealous (she gets jealous very easily) or just tell her I'm not jealous of you and never will be. Please give me advice on what to do, it's getting me down a bit because I always feel like she's going to brag whenever I see her. Any help will be very good xx
-1	negative	unemployment	My trust issues are definitely increasing now. Geez..
-13	negative	unemployment	My wife and I are getting ready to file. We have retained an attorney. We make decent money, but have fallen behind with our taxes and rack up 50K in credit card debt. We own 2 houses, one which we have let my brother and his family stay rent free and also let them work with us and paid them under the table for the past 4 years. We have done this because they have been down on their luck. We thought we were doing the right thing but we didn't consider the financial drain. Now it looks as if we are going to loose most everything. It seems like everyday we are getting some sort of bad news. The stress is overwhelming and causing the both of us to go into depression. I would like hear someone who is a similar circumstance to know that we are not alone 
-4	negative	unemployment	My friend Keith committed suicide 10 years ago. We had a fight the week before, and I refused to speak to him. I still carry the guilt that if perhaps had I not been so stubborn I could have talked Keith out of it. I miss him.
-4	negative	unemployment	Not sure if Chapter 7 or 13 would be better. Husband owns a lawn care business. He doesn't have much work from November thru March, so no income. Can't save $ now to get us through the winter because all money we make is gone as we make it. $55k in vehicle debt & $55k in other debt (lawn mowers, credit cards for business expenses, personal loan & medical bill). We are drowning & can't keep up. We are current on most of the debts, paying others late by a few weeks. Not sure if bankruptcy is the route for us. I lost my job & not having luck getting another job. Unemployment was denied. Husband's lack of income for the winter. We never have enough money to pay additional towards the debts. Concerned about the consequences of filing.
-3	negative	unemployment	Now my kids will be homeless, too - I've been living in a tent shelter for 3 months trying to find work to pay weekly rent for my wife (who hates me for losing my job in a mass layoff) and my two small boys. Until now, I've managed to make it work. Now, I've finally gotten to the point where I don't have the money to pay another 180 tomorrow and they're all gonna be out on the streets. No one wants to help except people who can't do anything, no one else can be bothered to care. I am a failure as a human being and I wish I was dead.
-2	negative	unemployment	Oh dear! How can you be so dear to me, so precious to me, so special to me?
-13	negative	unemployment	Okay, I am 17 years old and I have just finished my first year of sixth form. (High School), the whole first year was terrible for me as many bad things happened and in the end I achieved low grades as I expected and my initial reaction was 'Okay, I'm going to come back from this, just stay positive and retake those exams. It might be hard but I have to do this!' but in a later interview with the sixth form, they revealed that my grades and attendance were poor and I wasn't allowed back for the second year. Although this is disheartening, I felt it would be stupid to worry and panic because that doesn't help at all. (I recognized I have sounded a bit big headed in this post at times and I am sorry for that, but I'm trying my best to be brutally honest)
-11	negative	unemployment	Ok so I been looking for someone to talk to, glad I found this site. My husband passed away exactly a month ago. He had a heart attack out of nowhere right in front of me. Me and my children performed CPR till paramedics arrived. He was only 48 I'm 41 and we were married 16 years.All of a sudden I have a huge desire to live and do all the things I ever wanted to do. I paid to go on a hot air balloon ride,,,I'm planning a vacation this summer (my first ever) My husband never wanted to go anywhere so I didn't either. But I've realized that life is just too short. I miss him so much though and think of him every day all day.
-4	negative	unemployment	One of the best ways to shortcut all of Life's Difficult Decisions is when I simply ask this question: What Advice Would My Father Give?I do miss him. One of a kind. Just wish I did'nt have the dam receding hairline gene 
-6	negative	unemployment	On the week of my birthday I got a chihuahua he was the sweetest little thing. One Sunday he wasn't feeling well and I thought he would feel better. When me and my mom were at the mall,my step dad called my mom and said he wasn't waking up.so we went home and then he was gone into heaven.so we cremated him and he sits on a stand with his two favorite thew toys.but although he's gone he still lives in our hearts. We miss you boy ill never forget you
-1	negative	unemployment	Or rather - I was unemployed thrice. 
-21	negative	unemployment	Our mother passed on May 2, 2013. I was staying with my sister this past weekend and she said "where are all the pennies coming from?" they were being found all over the house. I told her, "haven't you ever heard of pennies from heaven?" She said "No" so I told her. She keeps finding pennies everywhere in the house. This morning I walk out to my Jeep to meet her at the Registrar of Wills, there is a shiny penny on the bumper of my Jeep! Then when I get home this afternoon, I tell my husband about all the pennies. He tells meuh; when I opened my beer case on Friday I heard something in the bottom of my box, I turned it upside down and two pennies fell in my hand. She is letting us all know she is OK. I love you Momma and miss you more than you will ever know. 
-14	negative	unemployment	Part of myself is in the past and the other part is in the present . The conception of reality is broken down into fragments, seeing things that could of been and that has been. I live in both realities but one is consuming me, unable to breath, threw the confinements that is self-pity and denial. My past is what made me who I am I try not to live in it but it's lives in me. Don't dwell in the past, for that has already happened,  learn from the past and take what you have learned and use it to live in the present, and to create a future. Don't hide behind covers that's already been torn.
-1	negative	unemployment	People are leaving me on ep! I need someone to talk to.I'm just addicted to the use of it now! I need someone to talk tosomeone who's a good listener..communicator.with whom I could mix up easily
-3	negative	unemployment	People that don't understand the feeling of self harm think it's 'disgusting' but they don't know how you really feel. Wanna know what it feels like? It's relief, relief from how you feel, takes your mind off things, it makes me feel human again. It's so wrong but it feels so right. It's a mental addiction. If anyone needs someone too talk to about self harm, message me, remember you're not alone. Stay strong!
-16	negative	unemployment	Perfect? Its certainly aint me! Im far from it. Life has been unfair to me. When i finally found a good guy i developed alopecia. I pushed him away coz of my insecurities caused by this awful disease. I wasnt perfect before I got alopecia but atleast I was happy with myself, I was content with who i was and I had almost perfect hair. People say it doesnt matter that i have alopecia and that its all about inner beauty? But they dont have a clue how i feel? Who wants to be with a bald girl? Seriously which guy wants a girl with alopecia? and trust me i dont look like Natalie portman when she was bald or like shaved head Jessie J or Amber Rose!!!
-2	negative	unemployment	(please be aware that I am a little desc 
-11	negative	unemployment	Please I would seriously appreciate any financial help I can get. I am in a desperate situation, no light, gas, water. All utilities have been cut off. Rent due on the 1st of December. Nowhere to go to. I am totally broke nothing left in my life. Please, please someone help me out, I am not a lazy person, I use to make 5figure income when I took ill, THANK GOD  am alive today, had a brain aneurysm ,had to learn how to walk again. In the process lost my job. I am looking for a job as well. Any help will be greatly appreciated. I have nowhere else to go. This medium is my last resort.

-1	negative	unemployment	Right now i feel kind of lost. Not entirely sure what i'm doing or where my life is going, and with not enough close friends to pick me up
-5	negative	unemployment	Saw A homeless mother and her three children the other day, can you say Eww! She asked for a DOLLAR (Like that's enough!), and then started rambling about her pathetic life; how her husband beat her and her children so she left, and now is homeless.
-4	negative	unemployment	Seriously I grew up around that and it's always scared me but I've always known to learn from it but it also scrambled my brain with sadness and fear but I feel like it also help shape me into a better person yanno?
-13	negative	unemployment	Several weeks ago, my uncle passed away. Since I was part of a community theater production, the first thing I did was e-mail the director and producer to tell them of my loss. At the time, I didn't know when the viewing or funeral was, so I wouldn't know if it would interfere with rehearsal schedule. I also wanted them to know that if I seemed upset or distracted during rehearsal the following night, this would be why. They both offered me their cyber-condolences. (By the way, the producer was also responsible for getting all the cast bios. Even though it was past the due date of submitting the cast bios, she allowed me to make one amendment to my bio. In my last sentence, I said that I was dedicating my performance to my uncle "who passed away earlier this month.") 
-3	negative	unemployment	Shame on her.. So we walk in and she is like get your gifts and leave So we do and then to put icing on the cake she texts my sister and bashes the gift I gave her
-2	negative	unemployment	She lies awake, wishing it would end,  But consuming her hidden hopes.
-8	negative	unemployment	So hard to be in this position. We always fight now because i demanded him to text me or call me when he is at home or like now when he is having a vacation with his kids. I want to be a good ow. Please help me to be a good ow. And how to assure myself that even if im being relax about he situation that he still finds way to be with me like he always do? Im so depressed
-8	negative	unemployment	So I finished my Masters in Renewable Energy and Architecture in January 2013. I have done some odd jobs here and there but currently I am unemployed. It is frustrating me that I cannot get anything in the field that I am interested in. I mean what more does it take? I did poorly during my A-levels thanks to my complicated and horrible childhood but I pulled through it and worked hard and managed to get SOMEWHERE in regard's to my education. I really need a Job to move out of my family home and just BREATHE, Life is frustrating and I passionately detest the thought of asking my father for money. I have no choice but to go to the job Centre and get some kind of allowance so that I can pay my own bills. If anyone is OUT THERE PLEASE GIVE ME A JOB!!!!!!!
-3	negative	unemployment	So it has been 2 weeks now since I lost my dad. It has been a whirlwind of emotions, and I am still not entirely sure how to deal with most of them. So I am going to write out the events, and I am hoping that by getting this out there, it will bring some sort of closure, or something like that. 
-4	negative	unemployment	So I've been searching for a place to discuss where I'm at in life with people who are in a similar situation and this seems like a good start. It'd be nice to meet other young and unemployed individuals to vent with.
-1	negative	unemployment	Sometimes I could just breakdown in tears and weep like a baby at my failures and shortcomings. Please God I try so hard to be a good person.
-11	negative	unemployment	So my brother and I started a podcast called "Life According to Brothers" and talk about our life experiences, how we got through them, and what we've learned. My brother is the funny one and I anchor the show down and try to keep it semi-serious. I think the contrast between out personalities works well. He breaks out into song at times and I come back with witty remarks. But we always have a good time and look forward to answering questions and meeting new people who have had some great experiences.
-1	negative	unemployment	Soooo last day of high school!!!! Forever time to be more open minded, and a good person 
-1	negative	unemployment	"So we all have something store in our memory banks of the past that we wish we could have done differently , or something we  wish we didn't do." Just make sure to learn from past mistakes , forgive yourself and move on"
-2	negative	unemployment	Steve left us 9:17 pm JAN.  06 2014, I buried him yesterday and still deeply hurt & crying [2:54 am]. Listening to one of his favorite songs of the 70's: XIT "I am happy for you". 
-14	negative	unemployment	Teacher cont   I thought he was going to. Comfort me by rubbing my leg and as I was telling him he started moving his hand higher to just below my skirt I started telling him about my uncle and then u felt his hand go under the bottom of my skirt I asked what he was doing he smiled and said just tell me more he then looked  around and said Candice. Your a very pretty girl always liked u
-1	negative	unemployment	That's okay. I am always told I look young for my age
-8	negative	unemployment	The bullying started in 4th grade. I had a problem learning and everyone else could read better than me. But i read slow and tried to understand what i was reading and because of my slow reading the teacher had to keep me in during Recess and help me read the books.  Thanks for reading.
-8	negative	unemployment	The hardest part is the not knowing. We have no real answers. What happened?  I don't understand and it really hurts. Maybe someday, she'll call, if she's not dead, strung out on drugs (not likely, but again, none of this was likely) or brainwashed. But she'll have to live with the choices she has made, and how they have hurt the people that loved her. Maybe someday. Until then, everyday I try not to cry
-4	negative	unemployment	the longest job i haveheld was about two years. either i get fired or i resign. then i feel as if i've exuasted all of my opportunities because when i try to apply for another one they always ask me where i worked last and if i got fired i can;t put down that job then they wanna know why such a big gap 
-1	negative	unemployment	The pain is becoming to much ive tried to fight this depression but i just cant its eating away at me its killing me i just cant take it anymore ..i realy cant i feel deadim hurting so bad i just cant go on like this i realy realy cant i can't fight this pain i just want to sleep and never wake up ..at least ill be with my dad ..hes up there waiting for me im crying almost all the time i feel so alone:'( :'(
-5	negative	unemployment	There is nothing better then waking up in the morning and sparking that first joint. It is like coffee to me But keeps my nerves in tact! I mostly started smoking it within the past three years but oh baby I will never give my sweet green up.. I use it to treat my BPD and let me tell you, it works 110% better then any meds Ive been given! . On that note, time to smoke some Mary Jay!
-11	negative	unemployment	There was a time when day turned into night faster than I could take in air. The feeling that I felt was heartbroken.  I thought of how events took place in movies, but in reality it was something that I couldnt even imagine. The way my mom hand had a numb feeling and was not able to move like it always been when I was with her.  I look out the window seeing how life is moving and people do not care about what happening in the moment of their lives. This is my story how losing someone is the most difficult thing, but not as difficult as losing my mother.  
-3	negative	unemployment	These days I'm working on my fourth improvement.I want people to say only nice things about me.
-5	negative	unemployment	These last few years were hardest year of my life. I had lost both my parents, my 14 yrs old brother moved two states away, and I loss my unborn child by 18.(while in my first year of college) I'm so confused, I'm trying to figure me but between my life and my family problems there no time. They don't understand the simple fact that I'm tired of this, of feeling like I don't belong, of not having a home to call my own. It's so depressing! I don't know what to doI trying to take care of my life(people, brother,etc.) and just keeps piling up. It hurts to feel this way..
-7	negative	unemployment	The title says it all  I'm so tired of the routine, so tired of being stuck doing nothing. I guess I'm really tired of trying and being rejected all over again. Sometimes I feel life is pointless.You are born and then you work work work until the day you die. When I was working life seemed to pass more quickly, now that I don't work time moves extremely slowly and I can really see how depressive life is . working allowed me not to see how awful it was, now I can see everything
-18	negative	unemployment	The weirdest and saddest thing happened to me 2 years ago. I had a blind cocker spaniel her name was Miley. I really liked her she was a good dog with a great personality. So I was getting ready to go to school my mom drove me we were backing out with the car I took a last glance to see Miley running around in the back of the garden. I started looking for my lipgloss in my bag when my mom screamed that se ran something over that something was Miley. I was startled and sad. I didn't even want to believe it. The weird thing is the only was she could get under the car is if she ducked and went under on purpose. The previous week I noticed she was depressed cause we had another dog who started to bully her but we gave her away beforehand. It's like she knew what she was doing which made it even more sad and made my whole family feel guilty. Till this day I never meet a dog like her she was smart and calm and special she will be missed forever
-2	negative	unemployment	They're in my head and they won't go away. They fight and laugh but I'm not happy. They love my boyfriend and he loves them. Why can't I be like them? They're loved a lot. Not just by him. It isn't fair.

-3	negative	unemployment	This is a lie. I'm actually with myself. Things are really working out.
-4	negative	unemployment	This is my first post and as most of you INFPs will be able to relate, it is easier for me to open up to strangers, rather than divulge my inner most feelings, thoughts, or dreams with those that I love and/or love me.   I love and care about those around me, I do!  But I will always be the first to walk away from any relationship.  I keep all people at arm's length.  I will not allow anyone to get close enough to know me, and know my heart.  If I did, they would ridicule my dreams and leave me.   While my heart is a shield and I won't let it down, while I am so afraid to fail so I won't even trywell how can I say I'm alive
-7	negative	unemployment	This morning at 6:30 I went to the drugstore.  I was approaching the entrance at the same time as another lady so I waited for her to go in first and followed behind her.  She was about my age and I had never seen her before in my life.   Who acts like this? Honestly?  Is it just hatred or could it be drugs or something else?
-16	negative	unemployment	This morning, I showed up at work to discover I had been fired. I had a stomach bug on sunday and, since I have to be at work at 5a, I texted my manager at 4:15 to let her know but she, apparently,  never received the message. I could go talk to her right now but I have no motivation to work for a company that is so defensive and paranoid, even if it IS the best money I'm going to make in any job I'm qualified to haveand to clarify, texting is the main form of communication for these people and, given the absence of training, I was never told WHAT to do if I have to call in. Meanwhile, I don't know what's wrong with meis it anxiety? Am I having a quarter life crisis? Am I just lazy? Side note: I have always been a dependable, hardworking individual. While I may have job hopped in the past, it was on good terms and for the sake of new learning experiences.  This past year, I've been just trying to survive; I've been treading water.Idk.
-1	negative	unemployment	This picture resonates with me strongly . 
-8	negative	unemployment	This situation isn't easy, it's very tough, I have no real identity, and questionable value. I feel comfortable with who I am but at the same time I don't feel all that I could be right now. Anyways about two weeks ago, I started pushing myself to approach my current situation more seriously.  I've since found a job a few months ago. It took some creativity on my part in reaching out to employers in unconventional waysmaking connections with people but my sentiments about being unemployed remain and I hope if you're reading this get comforted by the fact that you aren't alone good luck fellow EPers 
-3	negative	unemployment	today i ripped apart a shirt. im using it as a pattern to make a trench coat. i picked up an medium industrial sewing machine and want to make a cowhide coat.  ill post as i have news.
-6	negative	unemployment	Today marks 6 months since my beloved dog passed away My heart is so brokenThe pain of a broken heart, especially because of grief, is the worst pain. It's agonizing deep wound that keeps hurting and one day when the wound heals, a scar will remain. If my tears could build a stairway, and memories a lane, I would walk up to heaven and bring him home

-3	negative	unemployment	We are a young family with 3 children, life was going great. My husband was working and we were financially stable so I decided to go to college and take a course that would give me a career in helping people. We lived in a house that had really bad mold and had no choice but to move out as we were all sick, currently I am battling pneumonia which I can't seem to shake. My husband was just laid off unexpectedly and employment insurance is not an option and there is no income right now We haven't been in this situation in years and we are not proud of having to ask for help but we really need it. We are in danger of losing our home and utilities and I am going to have to leave school because I don't have funds for transportation. We really don't want out children to have to suffer..
-3	negative	unemployment	Well, golly gee, virtual currency is hard to come by.Holy heck, EP is more like real life than it seems. Social circles, funding issues, petty squabbles, activist groups,  and a funky rule system.

-6	negative	unemployment	Well, let me share my  story. I moved to a new state for a new big project. I work as a Project Manager. 6 months into it I got a DUI, no one was hurt but because it came out in the newspaper I  fired from my job yesterday because of it. This can ruin me financially with the lawyer costscourt fees, not being able to drive, getting a new job with a DUI. Now I am packing up all my belongings and need to drive across 5 states to get bck home. I am FUCKED!
-6	negative	unemployment	Well she hasent exactly ditched me she doesnt want to hangout with me she plays tricks on me that she thinks is funny just to make me embarrassed she ruined my school life i dont have a crush anymore thx to her and all my other friends like her as well so they will probably ditch me.. Im so alone :( im not popular enough for her or anyone
-1	negative	unemployment	Well someone just used the L word on me for the first time in more than two years Kinda want to run away screaming. Kinda want to say I like you too.. I don't think I'm ready to love again. I know I'm not ready. How can I love him back when I don't love myself?
-14	negative	unemployment	well the short version is I'm a newly single mom who left an emotionally abusive relationship, when my husband started telling our baby to call me a (b) and he would shake and cry from my husband yelling, I had to leave to protect my children. I am a stay at home mom, but have been trying to find a job. I have no family or friends to rely on, so it's hard trying to find a decent babysitter for me to work. With no income, the bills have piled up. I am getting food stamps on the 14 th, but all other charities have application processes that take time. As a matter of fact, I just got off the phone with St. Charles in Picayune, but the lady said they could give some diapers, but they only help their own parishioners. Am so overwhelmed.  Sent from my Galaxy S
-4	negative	unemployment	well this is my first time to doing this but hi i'm 14 years old and currently going through ocd , its starting to ruin my life because everyday i cry and i'm in fear for my life , the thoughts i have are terrible like my mind likes to make me think i hate my mom and i know i don't stuff like this makes me cry everyday sometimes i'm scared to look at my mom or even tell my mom whats wrong because i don't want her to think i really hate her or that i'm crazy (i'm crying as i write this) but i'm pretty sure i'm probably the only person that has these thoughts i even take quizzes to prove i love my mom because i let my mind get the best of me i really need help and it hurts me everyday.. Can someone please tell me i'm not the only one that has thoughts/or problems like this? because i have a fear of hating my mom.. am i crazy or do i really hate my mom , i really hope i don't because i know really love her.. i just know it, but my minds making me think otherwise..

-7	negative	unemployment	When I'm at work I see many people with their families enjoying their day. At the same time I wonder if their happy with who they are, with what they have, and who they're with. I can't help but think some of these people are sad and lonely and filled with endless questions. Who are as transparent as I am. 
-2	negative	unemployment	When I see real estate ads for $5 mil. oceanfront estates (and so on), and realize Life wasn't supposed to be this way but it is--and there ISN'T A FUCKIN' THING I CAN DO ABOUT IT!  IT'S TOO LATE FOR ME.
-2	negative	unemployment	When i was 4 years old i had a dog named chelsey she was a cute big dog! But i only knew her for a little of time ;'( She dug a hole under the fence and ran away! ;'(
-5	negative	unemployment	When I was a kid I once walked into a candy shop with money. The walls were stacked with choices. Decisions. I walked out empty-handed, crushed, head hanging low. Standing there in front of the counter the pressure to decide with only so much time to choose got stressful. I chose nothing over anything. I realized one of my shortcomings that day.
-13	negative	unemployment	When I was pretty young, my little sister and I were arguing about where we should go for dinner on our mom's birthday. The argument got kind of violent very quickly, seeing as we were pretty much babies and hitting and yelling ensued. My sister managed to give me a really deep scratch on my left arm near the crook of my elbow. I remember how it didn't really bleed or hurt, it just stung, and as time passed I loved seeing how it healed unevenly and eventually scarred. It's not that noticeable now as it used to be, but if you're looking you'll find it.
-4	negative	unemployment	When I was school I really loved drama, debating and acting. I was so excited the possibilities of my life and all the great fun things I would do in it. Well none of that came to fruition.  I have always lacked self confidence and when it came to the crunch, I didn't have the courage to pursue my dreams. I really got off track, just partying, using drugs,wasting my time and life.  Now I'm forty three, working in a nothing job.  Social life left with last boyfriend.  I work night shifts so it seems impossible to go and do social things.  I go overseas when I can, but I do it alone.  I'm scared things won't change. I don't know how to change them.
-5	negative	unemployment	When I was younger I did really bad things.     I wish I could go back to when I turned 14 and just start over from there But as I'm growing up I've learned to learn from all the mistakes I've made. I'm just so happy with who I am right now and I hate looking back at how I used to be I'm just going to keep moving forward and block out my past.
-5	negative	unemployment	When I was younger I took pleasure in harming people mentally. The pleasure I gained from watching my peers crack under pressure was immense. The weaker their mind, the harder they cracked. Actually being violent or murdering someone does not intrigue me, but to bring someone to the breaking point where they consider suicide, that gave me satisfaction.  As a supervisor, I see my past guilty pleasures surfacing here and there. Yet, I believe in occupational integrity so I refuse to indulge in the mental anguish of others; for now.
-1	negative	unemployment	When someone says you mean a lot too then  Why do they leave ?
-2	negative	unemployment	Who wants to be my friend hope who ever wants to be it's cute loving and single and fit and ages off 15-16
-2	negative	unemployment	Workers comp decided to knock my pay down from maximum 917.00 per week to 400 per week claiming they are over paying me..lol..just days after surgery. That is the biggest crock of crap..any similar storys and can they actually do this? Pennsylvania comp claim..
-6	negative	unemployment	Wow My dad was a smoker from age 15 to 52. He had been saying he was going to quit for years. He finally quit in summer of 2004 after he had a little discomfort in his back / side. He went to the doctor in July. He was diagnosed with metastatic small cell lung cancer. He left us that October After he died, dozens of his co-workers quit in his honor. Just know that you're not alone
-1	negative	unemployment	Yeah, I get that a lot. It's not true.
-5	negative	unemployment	Yes, I've got a job, after 6months trying. it's a good message and also a bad one. The good thing is that I 've got a job before leaving school(only 7days left),  sad thing is, they treat me as a newly graduate student when I in fact have 3years working experiences in this field.          Anyway, Thank Godness!
-5	negative	unemployment	Yesterday a girl I knew committed suicide. Her name was Amanda Todd. You can search her on google if you want, she's been in the news and everything. **EDIT** The RIP Amanda Todd Facebook page has over a MILLION likes now.
-3	negative	unemployment	Yet, they tell me that I am doing what I should. So keep going. So sometimes I laugh to keep from crying.. but when that doesnt work.. I just cry.
-3	negative	unemployment	You know when in the new job you try to show your best and be as handy as possible I hope that things become more clear soon because I'm, honestly, stressed about it!
-3	negative	unemployment	You told me to be social and make friends You know I don't know how and I'm so scared.. How do I talk to people.. You wanted me to talk to boys.. You're my therapist.. You're supposed to help me! To teach me how! :'(
-1	negative	unemployment	You were my friend for just over a year  
-19	negative	unemployment	You would think I would get used to this by now.  Me getting let go. Usually, it's the company is going under, it's restructuring, there is no further work. I normally get a severance package.  This time, it's different.  What is worst, is the company is so far in debt, the owner is blaming me for his poor business decisions. I have a whole slew of evidence against him but it really is shocking how addled a brain can get when someone is financially in trouble.  It's too bad.  He could have been honest and just told me he had to let me go due to finances, but instead, he made up an excuse, didnt pay me severance and is now spending more money in a law suit because he wrote I quit on my ROE so I, a single mother at Christmas, can't even get employment insurance to make ends meet.  Sarcastically said "what a brilliant business man".  Hoping Ill be able to pick up a job soon.  On a good note, at least I can upgrade my skills a bit.
-16	negative	unemployment	 I think that my job situation may be changing. I received word that a certain requirement for employment that a lot of trucking companies need for their employees has been approved for me. I should be able to pick it up next week and that opens up more doors for me to hire on with a reputable outfit. While waiting for opportunities such as what I have just now received I applied at the local stores, motels etc for employment. I wasn't hired. I even asked for part time work, but was denied. When I filled out applications and you have to tell what you made from your last jobs, prospective employers see how much experience I had and the amount of money I was making, they turn tail and run. It's frustrating to live in small town America. Low wages and high prices for goods and services. Like I said, "A light shines for me now." 
-5	negative	work Confessions	2 days ago I was scared of those Oranum psychics who were trying to read my future and secretly judge me while I was Ep-ing and downloading movies. Today I am mostly bombarded with Oranum psychicsbut they are nowhere to be found on my right side of my laptop screen. They are everywhere on Q and A section. Now that's scarier.

-5	negative	work Confessions	All I can say is I hate my husband but I'm afraid to lose him. We have been together almost 10 years and I kind of love him but hate him with a passion. Lord knows I try not to hate anyone but when you have been drug through the mud time and time again you can't help but to resent that person. Just want to scream, baby I FUCCIN HATE YOU!!!! Ahhhh a lot better.
-2	negative	work Confessions	all i ever wanted was to be a real person without being fake, and somehow i became white trash.

-3	negative	work Confessions	Almost every night, I sit in bed with the tv on and my phone in my hand, where I journal. It's probably not a good habit, but it's such a strong one. It's almost gotten to the point where I can't sleep without my tv on and after writing down reflections from the day. Stimulation from screens stimulates the brain in a way that tells it to stay awake and alert. I dunno I've improved a lot of my bad habits. Some of them I'm just not ready to give up.

Ur face it's not even pretty. I have just been trapped in the wrong situation. Met the wrong person. But, eventually with Gods help, ill rise above it.  U in the other  Hand lack class and brains. U like me have to learn that people lie. If he truly dint want to ever see me. Not even mind games would keep him coming back with his lies. Yes, I have work to do so, I could leave this dark period.  But, it seems we all have a lot to work in.  Grow up, brainlees cheap hoe!
-4	negative	work Confessions	and cry late at night. I am the human equivalent of the drama masks of comedy and tragedy.     Sort of getting tired of these up and down emotions though.

-5	negative	work Confessions	and i didnt win! i was 20 and was not legally in the bar, my bestie worked there and we went to pick up her check, they let me walk in w her even tho no one was allowed in the door w/o showing their id. as soon as we got in one of her co workers grabbed her and said "we need one more person for the contest!" she grabed me and said "She'll do it!" i was reluctant but they were begging and said id get a bottle of champange just for participating. it was embarressing and i didnt evenwin.
-3	negative	work Confessions	and I haven't had s ex in 5 months. Sad to say, I got laid more often when I was single. Sometimes I wish I had someguy to call up for a casual f uck every now and then, but that would be morally corrupt. I don't even bother to get myself off anymore. I just got bored with it. Now I know how old men feel when their wives won't put outand I'm a 29 year old woman. This sucks. friends Confessions

-9	negative	work Confessions	and I was recently diagnosed with OCD due to my checking behaviors. Whether it was a possible unlocked door, a candle lit and forgotten, an iron not switching itself off, a possible stove/oven cooking by itself, or some incredibly perverted robber-murder-ghost coming to get me that I created in my mind, I had to make sure it didn't happen and be ready in case it did. Basically, I had to always to prevent anything bad from happening and I had to be prepared if that horrible experience. If you creeped on my 14-year-old self, you could observe me walking back and forth between my front and back door wiggling the door knobs to make sure they were locked for a half hour like a drunk Alzheimer's patient.

-3	negative	work Confessions	an option. I think i might have options but you aren't one of them. The feelings aren't optional. The only part of this I can control is myself and my own actions. I don't think you know how bad I've got it for you. I don't think I want you to know either. This is the best plan of action I can come up with (none) unless you have some better idea about what I ought to do about you? Wouldnt you avoid you if you were me? What would you do? Help me?

-6	negative	work Confessions	Are difficult to just talk about with specific people.  Like really  craving a certain food and not having anything.  I know it sounds cliche but no one knows talk they walk in the others shoes.  And maybe I could talk about how good that good is but put it in front of me.. You have to be laughing all over the place.

Please, tell me once again that I am strong. I have forgotten.

Guess it was just easy to leave me well off.

-8	negative	work Confessions	Because of how negatively it is viewed for men to feel sad or angry, (I have no clue why a girl does it and it seems natural), I have to lie every sentence about what I emotionally feel when asked by anyone. Even if I tell my parents they don't try to comfort me, the only time the ever tried to figure what caused an emotion was when I finally decided to tell them I no longer feel any different when I harm or help someone and that harming people comes to me without thought so does helping people. At which point my dad threatened to send me to a psychiatric ward, my mother called me a liar, my brother told me I need to start seeing a therapist and my other brother said he is hoping I am a lying about that because I would otherwise be a monster.

-11	negative	work Confessions	Been some time since they have been in my life and since then I have not had one single moment of drama directly related to me.   Nothing breaks, nothing is missing, no moments of despair or what did I do to deserve this --   not to mention the perks of smiling more, crying less and finding life no matter what it throws at me is 95% of the time rather enjoyable.    However, they had a good side but sorry to say, I remember very little of those moments as the bad superseded them by 100 fold.   The good was only good because the bad was very very bad which sad to say, is --  sad to say.  Never been the same since and I doubt seriously they have given any of it a second thought.   Forgiven yes forgotten never.

We fight all the time and I just want to figure out how to be happy again. I care for him immensely, but I find myself wanting more in life than what he's offering me. He would make any woman a happy woman, I'm certain of it, but sometimes I feel like I just don't deserve him or have what he's looking for I wish some days that he would just end things with me I want to be in love again, I don't want to be an obligation. I have even suggested that we go back to just dating, you know, here and there a few times a week, but then he starts crying and acting as though I've beaten his heart into the ground.

The sky darkened, the trees were on fire, blackness was writhing all over the groundwhat was the point of keeping on?I left the field, went over to the bench, and just broke down.

Sometimes, they ache and the only relief is a hungry, eager mouth. Hope I am not alone in my desires.
-5	negative	work Confessions	for the past 2 weeks i've started starving and purging myself. it makes me feel better knowing i've lost 7 pounds. Yea i'm starting to get dizzy and really bad headaches and this weird pain in my side but i'm getting skinnier. WHICH IS A PLUS! i don't know when i'm going to stop i don't even think i want to stop
-15	negative	work Confessions	For years i have done nothing but lived my life to a code i felt others should. I had always hoped that if I continued to do the right thing, that it would work its way around and back to me. As time has passed, i have found that the world does not seem to care how I act. I have found that I have almost no real friends. That women use me or cheat. The first chance anyone seems to get, they exploit for their benefit even if it involves stepping on me, all the while I would have done anything to help them or any of the people around me. Say goodbye to my generosity, I am officially out for blood.

-17	negative	work Confessions	From 6 to now, all you have done was criticize me. You called me stupid, fat, ugly, a geek, and worthless. You pushed clothing on me that I didn't like and claimed that I hated you. You never praised me for doing good and woke me every morning telling me that I'm a terrible person. Why did you treat me so? What did I ever do to deserve such treatment? You told your own daughter to go to hell all because I fixed the remote that you threw at my head. If anyone hates anyone, I think it is you that hates me and I think I know why. You were the youngest and you claim that you were mistreated by your brother and father. Am I your release? That's really not fair. Do you see me as evil because I am the older sister? I just wish I could tell this to you, but I don't want to start a fight. I know how you are. I will become a demon to everyone you talk to and I don't want that So how can I get you to treat me better?

-2	negative	work Confessions	Going "cold-turkey" really is hard! I feel like I'm having emotional seizures because one minute I feel triumphant being able to avoid going to see you but, then at other times, Ifeel like it's all for nought because I'm here pining away. I ask myself what sense and headway am I really making if I'm just mulling over you from afar; wouldn't it make more sense just to go, see you and get that hug I'm craving so much?
-17	negative	work Confessions	Going to tell my story in a short version, I have a crush on a guy that is 42 and I am 36 his mother has been my freind for many years and she adores me. I confessed my feelings for his son after one year of hiding it, and she took it very well and gave me advice. This guy is going through a divorce after seventeen years of marriage but he has been separated for almost three years. I have tried many times to invite him to a concert, lunch, no sucess he will make something up or recently he asked me to go shopping with him and took me by total surprise but then changed everything and we didnt end up going.. seems like he puts a barrier between us and yet he gets very nervous when hes close to me or talks to me and he looks at me from far away if we are in a room just a quick glance.

-10	negative	work Confessions	Hello there. I'm new to this site and think it could be the help I'm looking for. I'm a 25yr old girl that has picked her face since I was 17 (earliest realisation). As a teen I had flawless skin but as I grew older I became obsessed with my skin, especialy on my face and I persude in picking, scratching, squeezing, scrubing and generally damaging and making my skin sore. I cover my skin with makeup and hats and without either I am left lifeless and empty. I suffer from depression and anxiety and to be honest I think my skin pinking could be the one of the main reasons I feel so low. At pressent I am really trying to sort out my mental state by seeking perfessional help and medication, but skin picking is just a very hard habit to beat alone!!

-3	negative	work Confessions	I almost died last weekmonsters attacked. I almost blew up my 5th school when the janitor tried to take me out
-10	negative	work Confessions	I almost feel like it's said as a dismissal of everything a person has to offer and everything they are - replaced by this loaded word that people don't need to hear more information about to "understand". "Oh I had to get out of there - she was crazy." "I left him because he was crazy." "He told everyone I was crazy." I really hate hearing it because I know how it feels when other people entirely dismiss everything you are, have been and someday will be - everything you have to offer to a friendship or a relationship is lost from this one word that negates all your positive attributes. It's true - some people behave in a way that is so out of the range of normal, or abusively irrational to the extent that you wonder about their psychiatric condition. But for the most part I don't think people who are dismissed with this word are actually crazy.

-12	negative	work Confessions	I am afraid of everything. I have trichotillamania and deteotillamania. I am overweight. I self sabotage in so many ways and I know why.  It's because of the rape that happened to me over 5 years ago. See I was a virgin. And I was saving myself  "untill marriage" or untill I got into the most perfect shape ever.  Which would have been on my wedding day. But that didnt happen. My dream of being physically flawless for my first time was ripped away from me. Every time I try to get healthy and do better I self sabotage and the reason is because I'm afraid if I get close to physical perfection or even close to how I was before I was raped. I will be raped again. So I do everything to make sure I can't get close even though I know that being physically and mentally healthy will help with the healing process. But I'm still scared.
-4	negative	work Confessions	I am almost never alone and I just found out that my husband will be going out of town for a two weeks and I am going to use those weeks to try an ultra restrictive Kick Off diet.

-15	negative	work Confessions	I am constantly having battles in my own mind with my thoughts. It is like I think of a scenario and a voice in my head tells me whether it is wrong or right and then I fight with that voice. People think I am shy or just a quiet person but in reality I am having a conversation in my own head. I find it hard to talk to talk to people and have bad anxiety around them. Mostly I am fighting this voice to stop giving me paranoid thoughts. I always have this feeling when people leave the room they are secretly laughing at me or making a joke at my expense. I find it hard to be around my friends cause I come up with these delusions that they have some master plan and are trying to hurt me mentally and emotionally. I am tired of always having these thoughts and feelings.
-1	negative	work Confessions	i am deepley afraid of getting a jobim not sure if its because of the interview n my whole issue of being judged and making a mistake or because im just afraid of growing up! thats the only thing thats holding me back
-18	negative	work Confessions	I am feeling troubled today because I found out last night that an elderly woman I gave a rose to last Sunday passed away on Monday and I can't remember what she looks like! A friend of hers who was there when I gave her the flower thanked me repeatedly last night for being the last reason that woman had to smile before she died. "Noreen" said that the woman (who was 106 years old) was smiling all that day looking at and enjoying the rose I had given to her. She told me that it was such a nice thing it troubles me that, for the life of me, I cannot remember what she looks like. I realize that because I have been giving flowers to strangers for 14 years there is no way I could ever remember all the faces but a week later?
-22	negative	work Confessions	I am going to be turning 41 next month.  I am married, though not happily.  I do have three beautiful children that are my life.  Yet, I still hold onto strong memories of my first love.  This was back in high schooe were together for a little over 5 years.  We were engaged.  I am the one thar screwed things up.  We didnt end on good terms.  It took a couple of years before he could or would even talk to me.  Now its been over 22 years.  We saw each other for the first time last fall.  We both have changed alot.  He is married also, not happily.  But what hurts the most is he is so cold now.  His heart and his personality are shut off.  He acts like we didnt have something really special between us and like I never really meant that much to him.  Does this hurt me so much only because I am not happy myself in my marriage, or is it normal to always have feelings for your first real love?  He says "yeah, we had some good times but that was in the past"ouch.  Why do I even still care.
-10	negative	work Confessions	I am here, waking to see you., were here through the night, thinking seriously about how deeply. I love you and it feels so right. There is though a question in my mind.

-4	negative	work Confessions	I am not sure what to do I have been drinking for years since I was 11 years of age actually I am now 47 I do not want to see my 48th birthday but they keep coming around. I am at the stage where I seem to function at work even though I am drunk half the time I have never been without a job. I know it is wrong to want it all to end and I should want to live and see my children grow up and see my grandchildren, but I do not know how to live with the past and I do not know how to be happy anymore.
-11	negative	work Confessions	I am out of work. I am looking but it is so frustrating especially when I live in a state where there is so much prejudice. No I am not black. Others have asked me that. I am 61 years old, I am in good health, I have many experiences, I have many skills but am from Texas living in Minnesota and Minnesotans do not like people from the south. While searching for work or some kind of help I have been told many times what they have in Minnesota is for Minnesotans. I have told to go back where I came from. Believe me I would, but I have NO money and NO job and by the end of this month our power will be shut off, and we will be livin out of our car only it won't go anywhere without gas. Don't tell me about the social agencies, I have said they won't help. The worst is what it doing to my wife. I can't make her live like this. I need a job.

See you in my dreams babe XOXO
-7	negative	work Confessions	I am scared out of my mind right now. I've been having little panic attacks on a daily basis because of the thought of not getting into college.You would think a 4.0GPA throughout all of high school, being bilingual and having studied five language, and two instruments would calm me down and be a little more relaxed but I have such a fear of not getting into at least one of my top three schools. There are many smart people out there, so many people better than me that strive to go to the same schools as I. People with high gpa's and perfect ACT and SAT scores. These people look so much better on paper, so much better than me. I'm rambling. Someone just please help me try to calm down.

-11	negative	work Confessions	I am terrified of lighters, spiders and my own feet for no particular reason . I have to wear socks because I look at my feet and get disgusted. Its like im exposing an unmentionable. I am perfectly fine with seeing others bare feet though. I am scared of lighters but not scared of fire. My siblings enjoy using the knowledge of my fear to chase me around the house with a lighter and scare the hell out of me. I am scared of spiders to an extreme extent that when I see a spider, even the tiniest little thing, I scream. I scream and cry like the zombieapocalypsehas finally started.
-6	negative	work Confessions	I am the most jealous, hypersensitive person I know, and if my boyfriend so much as talks to another girl, I get these jealous shivers down my spine and I get anxious and start smoking cigarettes. I obsess over it night and day. It's ridiculous. He is reserved and respectful and he would never be unfaithful, but I am just so afraid of losing the best love I've ever had.He shall never know. No one will. It's so humiliating and irrational but I just can't help it.
-5	negative	work Confessions	I am underpaid. I know I am. Not just money-wise. But emotionally, mentally, physically. I am underpaid in life. I settle because I am either afraid to take a chance for fear of being rejected, or because I am lazy. But they are the same thing. I am lazy because I am afraid. I know I am worth more, but there is that little voice, or rather BIG voice in my head(aka society) telling me this is the best I will do. This is all I will find out there. I might as well take what I can get and be content with it. That voice tends to win alot. Funny what fear can keep you from. funny Confessions

-13	negative	work Confessions	I can't say for sure what, but nothing is right.  For months & months & months, there has been bad news concerning everything that's connected with me. All the bad news, heart break, confusion, fears & aloneness has played very hard with my depression. No one is here 'for' me, all my life, my place is to tend to, use my resources for taking care of everyone else.I had 1 person that I felt truly cared. I had. I' been alone now, for a long time & lve grown so weary, carrying the weight of my life upon my back.like a lifeless body. There's no color to life. There's no day that is special or fun things to do. There is life because I breath. But breathing keeps my mind on how empty I feel & lonely I am. How unloved I feel. Not just feelhow unloved I always have been. I don't know why. No past worth looking back on to. No present I care to be in and no future worth staying in hell for. "always fear the one who has nothing to lose".

-5	negative	work Confessions	I can't take it any more I have ruined everything in my life. A few stupid mistakes and it has cost me to lose everything in my life. My social life is no more, my depression is so bad I don't leave the house, in moments of emotional trauma I just do not see what is right or wrong. I hate my mind and how it ruins everything. I can't deal with how stupid I have been. I can't live my life how I want to as I live in fear. One major event unlocked something so tragic in me it will haunt me forever. I will never be the same and I have not only lost respect for myself but in my moments of weakness others lost respect for me too. Self pitying? Yes but I am a proud person and feel so ashamed at my idiocies. I am so weak. I feel too pathetic to even leave the house any more.

-9	negative	work Confessions	I cried alone last night. While he was sleeping i snuck away to cry it all out so i could come back to pretend it's all ok. I don't know what i need but right then i would have given anything for someone to hold me. Someone to tell me everything is ok and that i can tell them everything. I keep it all to myself. I struggle every day in secret and pretend i love it here.  I ran here about a year ago, pleading that this would be where i belong. Praying that i'd finally have a family that likes me. Running from all the hatred and emotional abuse, the attacks out of nowhere. What i didn't realize is that after i got here i'd still need to face myself.

I am sick of it.I am sick of you walking too close to me.I am sick of you touching me.I'm sick of you bringing chocolate and expensive gifts to school for me.I am sick of you commenting on every Facebook status.I am sick of you always saying hi to me.I am sick of you staring at me.I was sick of you getting off at my bus stop and following me home even though you lived two miles away.I was sick of you getting ON at my bus stop so you can sit next to me on the bus through the morning.I was sick of you assuming I wasn't angry at you.I am sick of being so nice.

-3	negative	work Confessions	I feel compelled to confess that when I first learned that Tiny Dancer's account was Hurts for Her renamed, I was stunned. I have never seen her profile, had only read of her love for Deb. For some reason I did not envision her to be tiny, or a dancer. With no basis what so ever, my mind pictured a two hundred fifty pound woman crying on her bed with a bag of Cheetos as she wrote. I do not know why. I did not confess before today out of a fear of hurting, but finally saw that as silly, since there was no basis. Nothing Tiny dancer did nothing to cause me to think this.
-2	negative	work Confessions	i feel like a fool for smiling everytime you look at me or touch me or play with my hair or say funny things when i know you dont really love me and i'm head over heels in love with you..
-10	negative	work Confessions	I feel like I can rarely live in the present, always being stuck in "that place". Like, when I'm sitting in a restaurant in a seat next to a window, I'm reminded of times when people used to stalk me and stare at me from a window somewhere. Thing is, I'm not even sure if those times were real. Maybe I just made it up because of my anxieties. But when I think of those kinds of "memories", it leads to another disturbing memory, like being stalked elsewhere. Before I know it, I'm in this place where I keep asking myself why people stalked me all the time. And it always leads to the same answer: because I also stalked girls. "Maybe I deserved it", I think, but sometimes these memories just get too much to handle. I feel like I can't turn my brain off.
-8	negative	work Confessions	I FEEL LIKE I HAVING NOTHING. I HAVE A LESS THAN IDEAL JOB, FINANCIAL, LIVING AND ROMANTIC SITUATION. I'M TURNING 22 IN LESS THAN TWO WEEKS AND I FEEL SO UNACCOMPLISHED. EVERYONE ALWAYS WANTS FROM ME, BUT FEW ARE WILLING TO GIVE OR FEEL LIKE I FEEL. I WANT TO CHANGE MY LIFE I JUST DON'T KNOW HOW TO START OR WHERE TO START. I FEEL VERY ALONE, BUT I KEEP PUSHING EVEN WHEN I WANT TO QUIT. I HAVE TO KEEP GOING I HAVE TO STAY STRONG I'VE BEEN DEPRESSED BEFORE ITS NOT PLEASANT AND I HAVE NO ROOM FOR THAT IN MY LIFE RIGHT NOW. IF NO ONE ELSE LOVES ME I DO. I WOULD LOVE FOR SOMEONE ELSE BESIDES MY MOM TO LOVE ME THOUGH.
-2	negative	work Confessions	I feel like I owe you an apology, but then I'm sure you want me to leave you alone anyway. I guess an equivalent would be never hearing from me again, doing you that favor.
-7	negative	work Confessions	I feel like I will never get better while I'm still living at my dad's house. My dad's girlfriend says things that are really hard for me to deal with. I can't live with my mom because her boyfriend spends every night at her house and I don't really like him- I wouldn't feel comfortable living there. I wish I could live on my own  But I have to wait until I go to college next year. My parents have been divorced for 5 years, but I cant really get used to the "having to choose where to live" thing. Technically, I have two places that I could live now (my mom's house or my dad's house) but I actually feel like I have no where to live.
-7	negative	work Confessions	I feel like people will eventually find out that I am absolutely clueless. Here's the thing: I was promoted! And now every single day I go to work, I panic inside. It is absolutely absurd. Here's the kicker that gets me every time: My people I supervise LOVE me. They confide in me, they trust me, they look up to me and (I wish I was kidding) call me a great leader. My bosses also see me as a pro-active manager who can rally people to meet the impossible, but here's the thing- THAT IS NOT ME! Other people are responsible for that stuff, and every time I bring up that I am essentially a fraud relying on the hard work of people smarter than I am it gets laughed off. I really want to quit, to resign my promotion, and get back to being a nothing underling. I feel as though I have no command of my situation and I am very lonely. This sounds like a pity party, but I just need to get how I feel off my chest. Thanks for listening.
-1	negative	work Confessions	I feel your  .I feel your desires.I also know whenyou thinking of me, wanting me,needing meI love you too but I shouldn't have let you touch me for so long when we know we are doomed from the start.We won't end up together in this lifetime.I want so badly to move on with my life and not let you invade my every thought, my every dream, my every feeling. I am so lonely because I can't seem to meet anyone who can make me feel love the way we feel for each other,The hardest thing is waking up alone everyday,facing the harsh reality,with my heart body and soul aching and longingfor you

-18	negative	work Confessions	If I wished upon a star, could I be where you are?  Midnight bright constellations  capture my soul to soar, as I dream,  on gossamer wings, angels bring me to you we embrace, your soft lips brush mine, our hearts entwine, beating as they once did, not so long ago.  How I long for those days swiftly gone by where I could gaze on your smiling face, , deep brown eyes, the smell of you, your tenderness and compassion When I think back on your beauty, I nearly faint. Anyone would have agreed with no complaint that you were beautiful. When first we met, and what a ride it was. Only you gave my body such a pleasing sensation.  You just made me want you more in every conversation. I would not have traded it for anything in the world.  So I continue to wish upon a star, yet I know I cannot be where you are. Midnight constellations remind me I'm left finding my own way to live
-4	negative	work Confessions	I forgot to add.constant defacation. I do not know where it was all coming from. Pain sitting on the toilet and really hard to wipe my bum as well  due to the painful spasms and limited movement in my lower back/hip area.Also I ended up really dehydrated, but drank lots of liquid to make up for it. Dont know if its all related but will see the Dr this morning.sometimes (often) I wonder how much longer I can put up with the pain.
-5	negative	work Confessions	I found my first gray hair today. I was a bit devestated. I know it's going to happen and eventually my whole head will be coved with them. Still it doesn't make finding the first one any easier. I guess I will just have to make sure to not to miss any more hair appointments in the future. friends Confessions
-4	negative	work Confessions	I found my purpose, though. It's to get my life in order. All my goals will fit. Work hard. Be okay alone. Lose weight. I'll work hard to leave them something. I will be okay alone because if I push everyone away, it won't hurt so much when I am gone. Lose weight. That's the funny part. Who wants to carry a fatso to their resting spot? I'm sick and need help. Don't worry. It's okay. I am already getting it!

-18	negative	work Confessions	I found the man of my  , a few years after his wife did.    We never had an affair, but he ended his marriage to be with me.    We were together 3 years.  3 months ago he found someone else.   Sometimes I still check his xbox profile to see what game he is playing, or her blog to see the pictures of them. He looks so happy.  She's perfect. I can't even hate him for the 30,000 he got from me, or the fact that he left me when I was pregnant, because when I see her- I don't blame him for wanting her.   She's everything I wish I could be. I wonder if this is how his wife felt before she got over him. I'm afraid I'll always love him. friends Confessions
-9	negative	work Confessions	I freeze, I shut down, cant cope with deep feelings. I CANT let you too close, I just CANT.I am NOT playing games. I care for you a lot, but I can only give. I CANT let you close enough to give to me. IM SCARED.There is a block in my heart where I NEED love, but dont know how to let it in. I NEED emotional intimacy.The last relationship I had was with someone I did not truly deep down have an emotional connection with, more a companion. But it wasnt enough and it was painful in its own way. Now I NEED to heal so that I can have a healthy intimate relationship one day with someone who can really know me so I can know and be known.

-12	negative	work Confessions	If we have met earlier, if I have confessed sooner, we would have spent more time together. We love each other more every minute, yet the distance between us seems to widen every second. As every second ticks by I know I am slowly losing you. It hurts to see how much pain you're in, how you struggle to hold on. It's painful to see how you laugh at my worries, telling me that you're going to pull throughbut we both know, that's not possible. I love you, and you must be so sick hearing this from me these past few days. I wish we just have a little more time, a week, a day, an hour or a minute longer. I'm not ready to say goodbye.

Why wouldn't I rent him a car? Because when I asked him for his driver's license, he said he didn't have it with him and offered, by way of alternative identification, the paperwork from his recent court date where his license was revoked for DUI.

I just want to feel beautiful in my own skin!!

-7	negative	work Confessions	I hate my   I'm grown now and I can't move out of her house. I left an abusiverelationshipwith my step father who raised both myself and my sister. My mother was never around. When we left my step father who was not onlypsychicallyabusive and verbally abusive my mother became the source of my problems. She said that everything would change once we left the house. I never got any support to leave my mothers house. My mother wishes she never had me. She has become verbally abusive. And now I just wish I was dead or no longer living. She makes me feel this way. She expected me just to forget what happen to me for seven years and move on. My mother never really taught me much of anything. She tries to act like she is the perfect mother that never does or says anything wrong in front of others but she is theoppositeof that. She is much worse than she lets on. I hate her and I hate myself. I wish she wasn't my mother. I wish I had any other mother in the world. I wish I had never been born.

So that I never have to return to any of these familiar places.

-10	negative	work Confessions	I just heard through the grapevine of another two high level managers who were both married and had been having an affair for years. This past December apparently they decided to break up their families and get together. I know both of these people (not personally but I'd worked with both of them) and the woman was a bit of a flake but I thought the guy was a straight arrow. Why do I feel like it's like Peyton Place here, too much drama? Too many people having affairs, too many management officials doing stuff that would get someone fired!I wonder if this happens in other organizations other than mine?
-15	negative	work Confessions	I just started a new job and the people that I work with bore the * out of me. They spend hours a day "chatting" about banal crap. Do they have nothing better to do? Really? The worst part is I play along. I'll laugh at things that aren't the least bit funny because I want them to think I fit in. I'll twist my face into a smile and nod in when what I really want to do is not talk to them. I wonder if they know
-4	negative	work Confessions	I just wish i had someone to talk to.  I cant help how I am at times.  I try.   You know.
-13	negative	work Confessions	I know exactly how I feel about you. Its a strong current that flows through my body as you walk past. The passion I must hold back to grab you from behind, turn you toward me and engulf your very being. To become one with all your essence.  I am constantly analyzing you, trying to figure you out. You're so kind, I would be the fool to misinterpret your loyalty and concern as a reciprocated feeling. I constantly hold back from you. I wouldn't know how you'd react if I ever crossed a line thinking it didn't existFor now you remain a locked room in my heart. Off limits, secretive, and daunting, until I know for sure you want me to have a key
-4	negative	work Confessions	I know he's not coming. I know he can't come. Why the hell do I keep hoping he's going to show up and surprise me? No, seriously! Why? He CAN"T come 
-15	negative	work Confessions	I know lots of people through online, guys flirted with me, some were even really serious about liking me. But no one has ever seen my picture, the reason is because i'm ugly, i never wanted to take picture because i can't stand looking at myself. No matter how much people asks for it, i never got the guts to show them how i really looked like. I always envied those with good looks because they get to take pictures, post it up and people give lots of good comments to them. I just wish i look like the other girls, pretty and stuffs. Through online, guys liked me, because of my personality i suppose, but that is also because in their mind, i am a pretty girl in real life. This hurts me so deep because i am not. I don't have the guts to show them how i really looked like
-13	negative	work Confessions	I leaned on someone. He was always there for me. And I learned to like his attention. The only problem is I am married with a child. My husband spends so little quality time with me. We never do anthing together. He never even notices when I try to change it up to make myself more exciting. I feel forgotten. So when my friend mentioned buying me a ticket so I could get out fora while I must admit I was excited about the prospect. And flattered. I couldn't. And I know he isn't interested in being a father or husband. But it was nice to feel loved again. But now I feel horrible for even thinking about it. I love my husband. I love how we used to be. I want it back.
-10	negative	work Confessions	I let him indoctrinate me for four hours. I was almost convinced to go back. Now I feel guilt and shame and hatred again. I thought I had won, but he won in my heart. I handed my power over to him and he put it in his pocket next to his fear. He is afraid that god will hold him responsible if he doesn't control everyone. Well, I don't have to agree with him. I CAN undermine his authority. But I cannot do it and hang out with my friends. They are his people now. They are gone from me. Until they are un-brainwashed too. I will be happy. I will not be guilty. I will not be ashamed. I will be me. I will be who God made me. God will lead me. That is what the Holy Spirit is for. I do not need to pull the others away. They have their own eyes to see. Hopefully it won't take them six years like it took me. funny Confessions

-7	negative	work Confessions	I like you. But I've already managed to cry over you. I deserve better and should set my sights elsewhere. But what you probably don't know is that you helped me get over my ex. Its just that I'm now wrapped up in you, waiting for you to get over yours. Its not meant to be, I know it. I just wish the love I deserve would come already. From or not from you
-4	negative	work Confessions	I'll never be over the douchebag that fathered my child. But would I ever take him back after the stunt he just pulled? hell no! I may be completely in love with the biggest * on earth but I'm not stupid enough to let it continue like it has been for the past 2 years.I need a good guy now. No more bull *. I'm done chasing something that isn't ever changing. I'll probably never get over him, but I'm moving forward with my life regardless. </3

-3	negative	work Confessions	I'm 35 years old and I recently quit my job. I have never quit a job without having another lined up. I have to say that I am soooo glad. I loved everyone I worked with and enjoyed my job but I hated the city I lived in. I quit, pulled my son out of school and moved. Now I'm jobless and scared yet know it was a great decision. Finding a job is going to bea slight challenge but I'm up to the challenge. The stres of being jobless is a new interesting feeling. I am bothered I didn't look for a job first.

-10	negative	work Confessions	I'm a divorced guy,50ish and professional, several months ago I met a wonderful woman online. We talked all the time at first and seemed to be bulding a great relationship but she would sometimes just start a big argument over anything, We talked a lot on another social site and she would block me for no reason and then contact me and want to be friends again. It seemedas ifeach time this happened it seemed to take something away from our friendship. So a couple of nights ago I posted something that had nothing to do with her and as usual she attacked me in a message and said all kinds of evil stuff about me without even asking what the post was about, and then she deleted me again. Why can't I just find a real person who isn't so insecure about themselves? Sometimes life really sucks.
-18	negative	work Confessions	I'm afraid that I'm never going to have a boyfriend/healthy relationship.  Never going to get married.  It's not that I'm dying for those things now: I know I'm young and I have time.  I have fun without, although I know I'd have fun WITH, too. But I know myself.  I have never ever ever been able to bite the bullet and just put myself out there with boys.  I do 1 of 3 things: 1. retreat and act aloof around them -- 2. I only talk to my girl-friends -- 3. I act like a brainless, giggling, awkward idiot around the really nice boys.   My standards are high as it is when it comes to boys, but when one comes around that makes me think "maybe," I can't even act like a normal person. I'm going to be 20 next year.  I always thought by now this would have passed -- if I just work on it bit by bit.  But it isn't.

-8	negative	work Confessions	I mentioned that I've been really considering taking up heroin again to someone, and she jumped down my throat of how I'm being sarcastic?What the hell ever, I just want some damn support. I want people to tell me that life'll get better and that I don't have to text my heroin dealer to feel good again, even though I know they'd be lying.At least then, people would be trying to cheer me up or something* it, I'm going to get stupid drunk. Maybe my ulcers won't like it, but I don't care.

-9	negative	work Confessions	I'm just lonely, like everyone else who wishes they had someone or could be with someone they love.  Just chilled to the bone lonely & so tired of it.  I'd change me or my heart if I could.  I can't make myself love or not love cause this kind of feeling,so vast & cold threatens to consume me.  It's all there seems to be for me.  I dread tomorrow.  In fact I dread every day. It's not fair to think I haven't tried to or want to 'make' it better.  I think right now I can see only 1 possible way to make this pain go and I've thought of everything I can.
-1	negative	work Confessions	I'm laying in bed alone, I've never wanted to have someone hold me while I sleep more. I feel so lonely.

-5	negative	work Confessions	I'm not a jealous person.I'm just a girl that would love to punch every other girl in the face that gives you a second look!
-8	negative	work Confessions	I'm not a mean person. I go out of my way to help people, I just have some issues with myself. I'm a bit intense. Things happen and I get hurt, but throwing things on those I care about would be unfair. But letting it out on here, a place that's supposed to be accepting and supportive, I get insulted even more. You know what? Some of the people here are pathetic. Completely and utterly pathetic. And now I wish I had the lack of conscience to insult you back. But I'm not like that. I don't just go aroundintentionallyhurting people. So I'm just going to sit around dwelling over the fact that someone out there thinks those things about me like the hypersensitive * I am. I hate this.
-1	negative	work Confessions	im nothing. nobody cares. those who i thought did always leave. especially the one i thought would never hurt me hurt me the most and he doesnt care about it. why am i so unhappy. why could i just not be born at all. i know i whine all the time but this is the only thing i can do otherwise i feel completely shut down from the world. i dont belong anywhere and cant connect to anyone. what is going on with me why am i not able to ever be happy
-16	negative	work Confessions	I'm not sure why but since I started dating my boyfriend 13 months ago, I've been having random dreams where I cheat on my boyfriend with some random stranger. It's just a kiss and the guys don't resemble any person I know, but when I wake up from these dreams that I've had about 3-6 times now, I feel upset with myself. I feel angry and ashamed at myself for betraying my boyfriend and hurting him. Luckily I realize they are just dreams. However, I am curious as to why I have had several of them. And I haven't told my boyfriend about all of them. I believe I told him about one of the dreams the first time it happened, but he didn't really seem to care. He just thought it was odd, then later when it happened again I got annoyed with myself for having those dreams so I kept it to myself b/c I felt it wasn't worth sharing.
-3	negative	work Confessions	I'm not too sure why I let you take advantage of me but I want you to know you haven't won
-8	negative	work Confessions	I'm not used to chasing after the things I want. I'm good at stealing their attrention away from the ones they love most but in the end they always go back and then I'm alone again, I'm satisfied with thrill .When will I decide to actually chase what I want ? *sigh*

-9	negative	work Confessions	I'm scared to do anything, because of what my uncle did to me. I am getting a restraining order agaisnt him very soon, so he can't do the things he did to me. But i feel like somehow he'll find me, but i know he wont be able to because the police will get him because he wont be able to go near me at allbut i still am very scared, and i do not want to be alone. Right now my uncle is at the police station answering questions and getting taped, and i have to watch it soon after its done, and i feel like im too scared too even look at his face. He was a good man, and i loved hanging around him, until he did what he did. I feel miserable, and i can't stop having these visions of him saying "Brandon, boy bend down for me, spread your legs" it makes me sick.. i feel sick..i can't do this anymore..
-1	negative	work Confessions	I'm scared to look away past the edges of my phone or mp3 at night when it is pitch black in my room because i still  believe theres like some sort of scarey monster,thing out to get me.
-7	negative	work Confessions	I'm sending a "friend" to visit all four of you in your sleep. Your hagma will be scared to death - literally. Your oldest will freak and slam a giant vase that takes care of the little one. And then you'll be chased right through that window so many many many floors above the city stre et and in my slumber a daisy will BLOOM!!!!! crappeople make greattttt fertilizer!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
-2	negative	work Confessions	I'm so sick of people telling me that neither me nor my life will have meaning or value unless I go to college. I just feel like some people aren't cut out for it and I fall into that group. I don't feel like that makes me unintelligent or worthless.
-1	negative	work Confessions	I'm still attracted to my best friend and will always wonder if he was the one that got away.
-3	negative	work Confessions	I'm supposed to have written chapter 4 but I have a case of writer's block. Hopefully my partner isn't upset that I haven't finished.
-12	negative	work Confessions	I'm the nicest, most well mannered young man you'll find. I open doors for strangers, I always spend my 11:11 wish on someone else, I volunteer regularly, but I hate soo much. I keep it inside and when I find someone worth letting it out on, I do and it's wonderful. I enjoy when people say they hate me, it makes me feel like something. My ex, as of December, (our relationship lasted a year and a half er so) still has feeling for me and once wanted to marry me, I left her and have done nothing but make her hate me more. I tell her to forget me, then read her poetry I wrote about her, I want her to be confused. I want to make things difficult. I don't know why but it puts a smile on my face.
-2	negative	work Confessions	Im trying so much to be what you need.why cant you see it? i guess i will never be good enough for you,but i will love you..Always.Thats my big mistake..
-2	negative	work Confessions	I   my fianc, and we have a 1 1/2 yr old son, but sometimes I just can't take it when he calls me names and he gets so mad and blames me
-12	negative	work Confessions	Ina totally disappointed in my relationship with my husband. I know that he is committed, and so am I. But I don't think we are companions, or friends. The relationship is dry, it has been for a while, but gets worse as time passes. We have both put in moderate efforts. Over the past few years we have taken a couple weekend trips. They are boring.  Maby he is lazy, or depressed. I know he  refuses to make any effort to be happier, so I am feeling like giving upbut that is scary.  Days and months just pass as we work and raise our kids.  One day we will be old, lonely and still together.  Yesterday was our 16th. I did my best to express love, and get a thoughtful gift. He gave me a plastic iPhone case- I own 2?!
-2	negative	work Confessions	I need to keep telling myself, I'll get through this. This rejection, this loss of everything. I'll be fine in the end. Just need to tell my heart to stop hurting, stop this pain that lurks there all the time. This is no life.
-5	negative	work Confessions	I never stoped loving you, i know its been a year, i know we didnt part on the best of terms,i still love you, i never stoped loving you for a moment, i just wish you knew.hasta la victoria siempre mi amor  i miss you
-3	negative	work Confessions	I never thought he would lie to me. How can I marry him now? How do I tell my family that Im too afraid of him to get married?
-3	negative	work Confessions	I never thought it would take me this long to get over him. It has been 6 months now and I still think about him most days. I still love him even though I know he does not love me back. I wish things were different. Sometimes love slips away and you just can't get it back. I hope that one day I will be able to move on and love again. friends Confessions
-8	negative	work Confessions	I no called no showed at my job today which I only started at 2 weeks ago. I desperately need the money but my extreme lack of motivation and anxiety prevented me from going. The job was a nightmare, I had to call in everyday to see if I had to work so I potentially never have a day off and it involved loading shipping trucks for 4 or 5 hours straight with only a 10 minute break in the middle. But because I needed the money so badly I had to just suck it up and go, but I just couldn't keep it up. I fought myself every morning for 2 weeks about just not calling into work that day. It was impossible for me to continually fight that urge because it was running me ragged. I had to confess this because I haven't been able to tell anyone and it has been driving me crazy.
-5	negative	work Confessions	In your heart, always, in your thoughts, often. Remember who we are to each other and that we are finally close to seeing each other again. You sense when I am thinking of you. You must know that every night I hold you in my arms and feel how we are at home with each other. You must sense the depth of my love for you and whatever doubt you may have will disappear when we are able to spend time together. I miss hearing the sound of your voice.I know we will have our time.
-3	negative	work Confessions	I prayed for my enemy to move away but I don't know if God will grant me this wish. he knows I can't move away. I hope either od helps me move away or her. I hope it's her though. she just won't leave me alone:'(
-2	negative	work Confessions	I prayed to the Lord for help, and He told me to find something to eat and drink. Think abut the future, the Lord God said to me, so I ate and drank, while thinking of the trials of my life, the ones that lay ahead of me. He said you will overcome these trials the way you will conquer your fears for today. You must always fight, and never surrender. Amen.
-3	negative	work Confessions	i quit drugs but i know i'm gonna use again the second i get my twin sister into rehab.
-2	negative	work Confessions	I really hope I can do this Living on my own & all. I'm just scared I'll fall flat on my face and just not beable to provide on a low income .
-1	negative	work Confessions	I really just want to go home
-3	negative	work Confessions	I regret the choices I made as a young adult and did not think of who and how bad it could hurt. I have been paying for it ever since. I am so sorry! I wish you only knew how proud you make me! How loved you are! And how much I believe in you! You complete me!
-15	negative	work Confessions	is a boy who starts a whole internet thing, won't admit to it - even though it's easily proven and he could get arrested, won't text you first, but won't answer texts you send.Why start with the internet thing?I don't care if it's overdramatic and overemotional. One's fantasy life or what's in one's head, no matter how dramatic, never fully translates to how one acts in real life. ButI think he wanted me to continue texting him like nothing happened in the first place. At the time, I was very confused as to what was happening. Now, this entire thing must be addressed at some point, even if it's dropped forever after that.He keeps on with it, so I do, too. I can't tell if he's testing me or the single most vengeful person I know. Either way, he's very crazy. But I already knew that. I know two truly whimsical boys. One is him, the other is my best friend. To be whimsical at all, you have to be a little off.
-4	negative	work Confessions	I saw pics of you today, Sweetness.  I started to cry not bcuz u look so beautiful but bcuz u are not the same person I fell in luv with!
-3	negative	work Confessions	I secretly know my husband likes it in the  I just don't say anything. It turns me on.

-1	negative	work Confessions	I simply feel terrible, I don't remember the last time I felt this bad, its terrible. I'm so miserable. And my parents aren't really helping at all, making fun of me, its just terrible. I have been pretty much sleeping all day long,
-7	negative	work Confessions	Is inflicting pain in people.  As my true   said, nothing good can come from being around this person.  I never believed in monsters before I met this person but now I am fully convinced they exist. There is no good in that person, they are devoid of it.
-3	negative	work Confessions	I sit up in my bed and wonder why i am even on this site, i came here for peaceand helpand you people are sohostile? i mean wow, you guys are gonna make somone themselves and some of youdon't even care.just wow
-5	negative	work Confessions	Isnt it funny how when you wake up in the middle of the night your thoughts always turn to really bad stuff? well mine do. I find myself thinking about stuff I need to sort out or things that need to be done and can't be done.. it's hell. because the same things during the day seem to just fall into place!!! In the meantime I find myself worrying about things that get my head in a twist. friends Confessions
-8	negative	work Confessions	is still holding on to or whining about a person should get out there and find a replacement. those that found something special are not wasting their time deciding how to think,feel or react to a person. if someone left you through deciding you're not worth the effort, quit talking about them and move on. most times you only miss the idea of someone anyway, and knowing how people usually are, all that's missing is options. and some advice, waste your time on someone who wants you and not someone who needs you. those that need you are just looking for someone.anyone. opportunists.
-10	negative	work Confessions	I started hanging out with a guy that had lost his wife to alcohol last year, just to be a friend. I was a single woman and needed a friend too. we did things together as friends but one night when we went out drinking things escalated and we woke up together.. I never had nor do I now have any feelings for him besides being friends but how can I tell him this? he has been so nice and helps me so much.
-2	negative	work Confessions	i started smoking green last year. it makes me fill sick , but when im doing it with freinds i dont feel alone
-12	negative	work Confessions	I started to cry (I NEVER cry) while studying for a math test tonight. It turned into serious bawling and then I threw my pen across the room. I can't figure out the material and it makes me sad/mad! Plus, it isn't just the math, it's all the subjects. I'm so slow at everything even though I study so hard! I guess my brain doesn't work quite like everyone else's, so I'm coming to the conclusion that college is NOT for me. I am stressing beyond belief, like more than any normal person should be stressed. I want to quit, although my parents would be extremely disappointed. But I'm not happy.Nothing would make me happier than to find a cabin far off in the woods and live there, surrounded by little forest creatures, forever. friends Confessions
-8	negative	work Confessions	Is that he cares for me and we have good chemistry, he finds me funny and he opens up to me. What I know so far is that it's mutual. Things cant be rushed, neither of us are in a place to rush. Im content that he cares for me, it feels warm and fuzzy 
-2	negative	work Confessions	I still have not gone through with the cessation of cigarettes. It was my New Year's Resolution and ironically I found myself smoking more cigarettes that night. Okay, I feel better now.
-3	negative	work Confessions	i stole girls high school basketball uniforms and wore them and did the nasty in them and i am obsessed with wearing them at night when i sleep.

-3	negative	work Confessions	It has been two months now that I'm dieting and guess what, I gained weight instead of losing it. PERIOD
-5	negative	work Confessions	I   that accent! I picked it up very quickly when I moved to Minnesota, and was disappointed after I moved away & noticed it was starting to fade. 
-5	negative	work Confessions	I think I have   but I feel like if I tell anyone they will think I'm just saying it for attention or I am lying.I'm sick of being miserable.
-19	negative	work Confessions	I thought he only said these kind things to me. We are moving and I found a card left behind from my boyfriends ex-girlfriend. He tolld me many things that he said he never told another woman, ever. Well I found a card that says the exact same things that he tells me. And he is not the most good looking man I have ever been involved with. He is middle aged, bald, not in the type of shape that I usually have relationships with. I thought he was special. Now I feel like I am someone that he just recycles his lines with. Not that special someone he says that he wants to spend the rest of his life with. He is an idiot. If the woman he was soooo in love with cared about him soooo much as he did, why would she leave a card he gave her here, and not take it with her?
-5	negative	work Confessions	I thought maybe this could be,   felt possible. Then just like that he told me goodbye. I wish I left my heart out of this, it feels broken but at least I know it is still alive. This to shall pass. A few good cries should do the trick.
-3	negative	work Confessions	"It is a shame you never did more than get pregnant and work as a cashier." I'm trying to even picture a scenario where someone would just walk up to another person and say that. What a self-entitled see-you-next-Tuesday. Talk about who has class and who doesn't! friends Confessions
-1	negative	work Confessions	It is so easy to say a million things that are amazing and uplifting, yet so hard to act upon it. I want to help others, yet don't want to help myself because i feel so down and lost. I feel like my troubles will never end. I just want that 180 degrees turn. I want to be happy so I can make others happy.

-1	negative	work Confessions	ITs called an obsession its sad really
-11	negative	work Confessions	it's funny how so much of what is written about love reflects the same hardships, the same joys, the same feelings, the same emotions people go through when in love. and yet, when you're in love, it feels like nothing you've ever experienced before; when you're hurting, lonely, missing them, it feels like a pain you've never experienced before, first deep, unbearable; then just aching, numb. and the one you're in love with- it feels like they are one of a kind, there is no one like them and there never will be and you will never feel this way again about anyonebut alas, you do, and there are new loves, and you will keep reading how many people feel the exact same way as you doand keep feeling like no one has ever felt like you do. life is a conundrum.
-5	negative	work Confessions	Its more than a year, he got married to someone else. Yet I still miss him and the thot of him with another woman makes me shiver everytime. I act as though I dont care anymore, but it hurts
-10	negative	work Confessions	It's my curse, my suffering, to somehow feel your touch when your not here yet. As much as I may pray and beg the Universe, nothing seems to work or put a pause to this longing. It's killing me, promise me to put an end to this one day. Sometimes I feel your lips on mine in my mind, or your caressing hands on my face, or even the warm and comforting embrace of your arms. I want so badly for all this to be true. Please my love, I want to know how deeply your admiration and desires run, to see if they could but match my own. What is it you want from me, I wish to know; please my darling, help me understand how deep your heart runs.

-13	negative	work Confessions	its so hard to know how close we were when we were together and now we have to be apart for eight months. i just want to confess its not easy for me and i still cry at night knowing that i wont be able to see you and do things with you as we used to do. however, i know that i still love you and im willing to wait for you to return. i just have a fear i might be doing this for nothing and you might change. but i put my trust in you i put my trust in you.
-9	negative	work Confessions	It turns me on when guys want me and it brings me satisfaction when i say no when they ask me out. I love the feeling of being wanted and i love the power i have over them when i say no. I love being their temptation.
-10	negative	work Confessions	it was about having a double personality. at the begining i was trying to protect myself from some dangerous environment and people. tried hiding in the bathroom but they broke itand then they end up taking me over and told me to keep it to myself and i woke up. then after waking up in a fraction of second before i sleep i heard a voice saying Yeahh loud and i realized it wass me saying it. how crazy i didnt realize i was speaking :S i think i'm starting to sleep walk..i really dont need that * lol
-10	negative	work Confessions	it was my way of getting revenge on my  , if I have to listen to her have sax, she will have to listen to me have sax, no girl went louder then a soft moan, how disappointing. I wish I had a screamer, oh wait I did once but my parents weren't home damn!

-2	negative	work Confessions	I used to hide and cry. In the shower in the closet. Never wanted my babies to see how depressed I was. Feeling better about life these days
-1	negative	work Confessions	I used to send strangers naked pictures of myself because I wanted attention. All of us want attention and it is the reason behind all we do. We want acknowledgement, validation, and care. And when we don't get it, we get desperate. I'm glad I have found this site so that I don't have to resort to sending nude pictures of myself to others in order to get their attention. Thank you for this site, your support, and your friendship people!

-3	negative	work Confessions	I've been 'alone' seriously too long.  I'm not even referring to intimacy either but that's seriously way too long as well.   I do love you.  I wish we could have been.  I don't want anyone else, won't have anyone else.  However what I do, if I do have you, there has to be real time together.  And it's come to the point that this isn't good for stress & anxiety for me.  It just isn't.   
-7	negative	work Confessions	I've been attempting to experience and write my way into an ANR. Whilst I have experienced some serious dry-suckling, I've never nursed from a partner who was lactating. I'm focusing my energies in this direction because I'd like to know that tight a bond with a woman, and I'd like to explore the heart-chakra energies there. To have my partner feed me from her body and to be linked to that feeding seems like it would be wonderful.

-6	negative	work Confessions	I've joined * like this before. "Oh, it'll help to talk to others like me!" Yeah, no. It won't. Not for me at least, it never does. Having someone to talk to doesn't make it better. Talking won't calm me down, talking won't express what's going on in my head to my girlfriend, talking won't make it stop hurting. Talking doesn't do *. I wish I wasn't so * gutless, that I had the nerve to actually off myself and be done with this endless whiny, destructive bullshit. I hate who and what I am but I'm too much of a ** to do * about it. I hate this.
-2	negative	work Confessions	I've just been so sad. My   is trying to overpower my sadness but it seems to confuse it. I don't know why I'm acting this way. Maybe I'm afraid of loosing something so great and knowing if it will happen again. We tend to hang on to things that are special cause we seem it won't happen again. My sadness I hope will come to an end but for now I'm sad 
-1	negative	work Confessions	i've never had a boyfriend, and i've been single my whole entire life.
-4	negative	work Confessions	I've often criticized women for falling in   with married men. I've been harsh at times. But here I am finding myself falling for a married man as well. It's true you can't help who you fall in love with. I'm sorry I've been to quick to judge other women without walking in their shoes. I sincerely apologize. I now understand what it's like to be them and be stuck in this hopeless situation. I was wrong.

I need you, I need us to meet please.There are so many misconceptions you have about me and when I hear how you feel it really pains my heart, we're so both on the same page it's laughable we need to clear the air, this has gone on waytoo long and it's not about placing blame or makng anyone feel guilty when we meet, but it isvital for us to be open and honest with one another about every and anything.I do have your number but let's meet first and then I'll know whether I can really call you or not, or maybe you would like to give me a different number and no I don't know where you live and even if I did I would NEVER come there w/o your permission.Let's make more of an effort to meet please, I'm missing you more and more with each passing day sweety. funny Confessions

-11	negative	work Confessions	I want you so badly I don't think I can take it anymore. I want to just tell you Maybe you'd admire my courage and that I went for something/someone I want. I've been trying to fight it this long now, but I can't fight it anymore. I'm going to embrace it. I don't know how I'm going to do it, but I'm going to: I'm going to make you mine. Something tells me you're the one I'm meant to be with - right now, for a long time, maybe forever. I'm so in love with you that I'm dizzying myself thinking about you.
-7	negative	work Confessions	I want you to know  I   you. I will never stop loving you.  I dream of holding you and kissing you while you sleep.  I dream of holding your hand on walks through the park.  I dream of having adventures and fun every night. Dreams they are, and someday, I promise, I will make them a reality. Dreams almost never come to reality. But they have always reckoned without me. You, who is loved. You know who you are. I simply love you more than words could explain. Fate will not conspire to keep me away.
-5	negative	work Confessions	I was chatting with one of my classmates online. They asked me out online so I said yes. Then the next I realized I'm not attracted to that person in any way. I needed a way out and fast so I came up with this. "OMG! I'm so sorry!!! That wasn't me online that was my cousin trying to get back at me. I really don't like you in that way. I can understand if you feel hurt. My cousin is just a jerk and thought it'd be funny to play a prank on me and in turn also hurting you.

-7	negative	work Confessions	I was married for two years to a wonderful man .Year One , we could not get enough of one another . .. Year Two became horrible . I could not move without explaining where I was going , with whom , and when would I return . Mail , contact list , were no longer sacroscant, . Needless to say , this destroyed our relationship . I decided to get out , which I managed to do , and have never looked back since .jealousy , and possessiveness are horrible human traits.. have any other girls had to endure them from their men? .What is it about some men that causes this ? 
-6	negative	work Confessions	I was on my little sisters computer without permission and I found this website up, and what she said about me. I have autism. I am high functionioning, to an extent. I can speak, and comprehend most normal conversation. It hurt to see what she wrote on there, about how she's embarassed of me, and I didn't know that her friends were making fun of me, but I can understand it now. I'm sorry i went on your computer, but those weren't nice words, and it hurt my feelings. Thank you.((This was dictated by her mother. My other daughter made a confession on here that she didn't like her older sisters around, specifically, this one. My middle daughter is in the middle of the autism spectrum, so she's well enough, but will more than likely not be completely independent at any point in her life. She'ss 15, and I wish the best for her and all her sisters. Thank you.))
-5	negative	work Confessions	I was so excited when i woke up this morning. I thought we'd be able to spend time together but that never happened. It turned out to be a very long morning for me.
-10	negative	work Confessions	I was struck up side the head. I can not get you out of my mind. You are all I think about. WHY!!! Could it be because you actually seem interested in what i have to say? Could it be the way you look at me? Could it be that i am just starving for attention and you gave me just a little bit of your time? I do not know. What i do know is that i can never tell you. I will never know what it would be like to be with you. I wish i could but since we are both married, it is just not possible. I will continue to think of you and wait for you to text me to see how things are going. I will continue to be excited to see you a couple times a week, if only for an hour. I will continue to love the short time we get to talk as we wait to pick up our kids. I will continue to live in a loveless and unsatisfying relationship because i made a vow for better or for worse! Oh, how I wish I could tell you how I feel!
-11	negative	work Confessions	I was supposed to get married. I was supposed to be a Mrs. No longer a miss. I sit here and just wonder what storm washd me ashore to this Island.

Thru the bad times and wait for the good times"      here is my question to u  after everything we've been thru would you fly to Vegas and get married to me this weekend?

-7	negative	work Confessions	I wonder if I am going to stop loving you any time soon. I am not sure exactly when I started falling for you, but I think I was a little late realizing it and I'm not sure I can do anything about it. If everything was different than how it is, I wonder if we could have been happy together. I hope I can get over you before you know that I need to.
-3	negative	work Confessions	I worked at a photo processing store across from a supermarket. It was a reasonably up market processing chain, so the prices were a little higher than some of the other chains around the area, for example the processing cost for 36 photos was around $15 or $11 with a coupon from the supermarket.

Makes me wonder why the hell I haven't tried it out sooner? Oddly enough, I hate having a shaved face, so I look even weirder than normal right now. At this rate, future-me is gonna have bellybutton-length hair, an unkempt beard, smooth legs, and no sx life.

My confession? I had a dream I clawed her eyes out of her head and bashed her face into the floor.

-11	negative	work Confessions	My boyfriend and I broke up 4 months ago and I miss him so much, he just moved to a different province last week. We share dogs together and keep in touch. He doesn't know I've been sleeping with an aquaintance of his. I don't even really like the guy, I'm just so lonely and I'm having a hard time getting over my boyfriend. He cheated on me but if he came back tomorrow and I could trust he wouldn't do it again I would forgive him right away and take him back. He says he can't focus on his art and his family at the same time, but we were together for a long time and to lose him because he wants to be a tortured artist just kills me. I feel like dying everyday and every time this other guys puts his hands on me I want to puke. But the distraction is better than constantly thinking about and missing the love of my life.
-6	negative	work Confessions	My boyfriend had a   that he was on a boat surrounded by a bunch of bikini clad girls crawling all over him but he couldn't do anything with them because he had a girlfriend. he kept saying "no!

Dying alone and not having my body discovered for days or even weeks. I'm not sure how rational a fear that his but I do not have many in the way of friends that come by on a regular basis just to say hello and my sister and daughter live in other states so I'm pretty much alone and I think about it often.

When its my turn to do the dishes, I've started to not do my best work on the dishes I know only he will use. I feel kind of guilty in doing this, but he expects me to eat off the dishes he washes, so I guess its even : )
-3	negative	work Confessions	My girlfriend and I broke-up on Saturday, very recently. Now, she continues to message me and it's making me feel bad because I hate seeing other people sad, most especially when I caused it.

-9	negative	work Confessions	My heart longs for you, someone not quite in reach but not quite out of reach somewhere in between sanity and a day dream. Someone who barely knows my name. Barely knows I exist but doesn't know how I feel. Doesn't know how special I know you are. I could describe your beauty but you seem so much more than that. Smart, kind, an inner beauty far greater than you know. If you you could give me one chance one chance to change your life, I would hold you tighter than you have ever been held.
-12	negative	work Confessions	My husband cheated on me, then left me and our two children to be with her. She had his baby but he begged me to take him back, and I did. Now almost two years later I find out they have been flirting, and kissing and who knows what else for the last two months ever time he picks up or drops off their child. Meanwhile I have loved and cared for their child and been home with her so they could both work, and this is how they repay me! With lies and betrayal. I am so hurt that he could do this to me again. I am so angry at both of them. And I hate myself because I still love him. I don't want to feel any of this any more. I am so tired. And because we have children I will never be free of him.

-24	negative	work Confessions	My mom is an alcoholic. When I was 9, my brother got me out of her house for good. I lived with my dad permanently and still do. I hadn't talked to my mom or brother since I was 9. I started to when I was 13. I thought mom had changed, or at least I'd hoped, but she didnt. she just wanted me to think she had. Turns out, my brother joined the Marines. I'm so scared I'll loose him. But, here's the catch: he HATES me for not talking to mom. Whenever the subject of my mom comes up, I make tons of jokes and laugh about it. I only make jokes to cover up the insecurities behind the laughs. I was still talking to my brother for a while. Then around August of 2011, he quit caring. My dad is all I have, all I've ever really had. He does his best to be strong for me, but his second wife, my step mom, just walked out on us. So we're both pretty messed up right now. Through everything, I've developed some SERIOUS trust issues and I try so hard to fix them. But so far, I'm unsuccessful.

-9	negative	work Confessions	My oldest son, when he was about 2 or 3 years old, just one night before bed time up and told me he had been a little boy before and when I asked him what he meant he explained quite normally that he remembered being a little boy before and that this was not his first time being a little boy. The way he said it, so matter of fact and so sure of himself was amazing. He had never been exposed to any religion or anything about reincarnation at that age, I am sure of it. Where this came from I'll never know. He never spoke of it again. But that experience always amazes me.

-3	negative	work Confessions	My parents keep fighting, it was fine when i was away from home and listening it through phone. but now i'm here for atleast month and i can't take it any more. Mom keeps complaining dad eyes at other women around the house and whenever she lets that slip away dad scolds her like anything. At times he even beats her. Mom is too weak to retaliate. I was shocked when i heard that. Dad thinks mom has a psychiatric problem. Now the situation is even more tensed. My home is not a home for me. I stay confined to my bedroom. I tried talking to both, but both are adamant to their words. I can't tolerate another fight. I really don't know what to do !! funny Confessions
-9	negative	work Confessions	My parents told me to graduate high school. After that, they don't care. I can do whatever I want.But Idon't know what to do after that. I hide behind this fact with calm, I-got-this-together statements of "I'll just wing-it!" or "I'll figure it out when I get there!" And my classmates think I've got it all going for me. I don't need to plan ahead 'cause when I get there, it will all be laid out for me and I'll run off to live a life of cool adventures free from the constraints of money and work. Or occasionally they think I'll get shot, mugged, or raped.But, honestly, I have no idea what I'll be doing when I'm 19, much less 25 or 30. I just hope the winging-it thing will work out as well as I hope.

So years later I told my parents what happened to me.I told them everything in a letter.they never had asked me anything about that letter.so I decided I was done pretending like these horrible things did not happen in my past.I decided it was not normal to see my step brothers and act as though they did not make my life a living hell when I was a child..so I walked away and I am now an orphane.I have never told anyone except my parents what happened to me..as old as I am I still feel less because of my past.

They over look your problems if you, A- are promiscuous. B-want an abortion C-love multiple tattoos. They judge you if you believe in religion. They judge you based on income. They judge you based on looks, weight, height. They judge you based on parenting. They judge you based on how you live your schedules. They judge you based on jobs, personality, childhood, where you live, what you like, what you believe in, how you manage a house hold, what kind of house you have, what kind of car, how you spend your money, where you vacation, what type of, and how much education you have, if you have children or should, how many, what you think of pets. Oh, the list is endless!!!

I really do wish that you never told me the truth, and that I could still believe that you fell for me as hard as I fell for you. Knowing this makes me feel so unspecial, and that really I could mean nothing to you, and I wouldn't even know it.  This is the sad truth, I spend sleepless nights thinking about you, wishing that you fell in love too. <3 I could be wrong or I could be right these are the things I think about at night.

(Ew, I know!) and I could see so,etching white in it. So it grew a scab over it where I had been trying to pop it and today I picked the scab off, and there was this 1/2 cm or so white thing on the end!

-6	negative	work Confessions	on July 22nd, 2009 at 4:46 PM Ive been with my boy friend for almost two months. We met in a unit and have been together since. I know the relationship isnt going anywhere serious but Im afraid to leave him. Mostly cuz Im afraid that he'll harm himself somehow. In June he was sent back to the unit and i didnt hear from him for two weeks. During those weeks, I cheated on him with a 20 year old. I ended the "fling" becuz i realized wat i was doing wasnt the right thing. Well the boyfriend went "missing" again for about 3 weeks. So i cheated on him with the same guy. Now Im afraid I might be pregnant. Everytime I finally settle down, I screw things up. I always say Im the one afraid of being hurt, but now Im hurting others becuz when they leave how they do, I want to hurt them just as bad.
-6	negative	work Confessions	Only two people in the world know about my bulimia, it's starting to really affect me. I'm missing classes, failing exams and not handing in essays because of it. I don't have time to revise for things because I'm spending hours making myself sick. I haven't told any of my family of anyone in my close circle of friends because they'd judge me or think I'm stupid, but it's getting to the point where I'm out of my depth and it's controlling my life, I don't know what to do..

-5	negative	work Confessions	Please don't kill any of your victims, it would be sad to know you went to jail  Ps: you don't hate a woman , is not the woman the problem it's you , maybe your problem is that you hate your own mother that's why you act that way. You havent gotten over that yet.
-5	negative	work Confessions	Please don't say how divine forgiveness is. Have you seen what you've done to my wife?  She begged you to do the right thing. You hurt her - you pulled her pants down, you touched her. I'm coming for you joe!!!!!

If I don't hear from you, then I'll know & understand ur decision. Tho likely unfair to decide anything unless we talk. Don't want to? Afraid?  Willing?   B fair, please.

What if I'm wrong? I want the best for her. A father is best but a father that makes mother angry, that makes me feel as if I have no voice? Alright. I'm not going to list the annoyances. We are both strong willed. Opinions, beliefs, practices, his lack of acknowledgement keep sus at opposite ends?  This past weekend, I used one of his lines: he said, "lock the door ." I said, "can I do it later?" That used to be his favorite line for several years. His second favorite was to tell his daughter, go see mommy"
-2	negative	work Confessions	shave my pubic hair anymore coz it is itchy now
-7	negative	work Confessions	She is just such a cold nasty **. She has been this way since I was a little girl, the only time she is nice is when she wants to borrow money and then she is back to her nasty regular self. When I was 9 she married some gross pervert who she is still with even after everyone told her to get rid of him. I just wish someone would break into her house one day and butcher her.
-5	negative	work Confessions	She mentioned she bought herself a pair of knee-high Jack Skellington socks for Halloween, last year. Now all I can think about is how they look on her.
-1	negative	work Confessions	She really is just gorgeous.  Today I walked with her a bit and I just wanted to reach out and pull her close.  Oh my. We are both so married, and this would be such a mess, and am jus a little crazed by this.
-1	negative	work Confessions	She's going to break my heart. And frankly it's a surprise to both of us that I even have one.
-7	negative	work Confessions	Sick of being the one who always "saves the day". Would someone please come and save me from myself???I feel like the worst mother in the world today. My two year old is home for spring break from school this week. Losing my job last week, plus my increasing debt and waistline has had me down and out. I am prone to wicked down mood-swings and have been a worthless mother this week. I haven't taken her to the park, or for a walk. Just stayed pent up in the now cluttered and disheveled apartment with lots of "comfort" (high carb, fat, and sugary) foods. What a worthless excuse for a mother! Poor sweet baby girl playing in her room alone while I sit her in tears confessing what a mess I am. HELP!
-4	negative	work Confessions	Since I first realized that I like you, but now over that time, I think I love you. But we're both awkward, and shy, so how the heck am I supposed to let you know!? You're a senior this year and I'm a junior. Please just do something already.
-9	negative	work Confessions	Sister, you gotta learn a little something.There's a fine line between learning from your experiences and then just being driven like a b*tch by 'em. Soyour kindergarten teacher never gave you a damned second, well it was more likely a third, chance, after you bit her so you feel compelled to give anyone who've ever wronged you as many chances as they desire. Cute. But your latest charity case is just sad.He f*cking stalked you, abused you, and really just ruined your life, and yet you're now letting him back in when he apparently hasn't changed? That's not being forgiving. That's being stupid. Oh, and not in a ironically awesome type of way if there's even one, but in a WTF IS WRONG WITH YOU? type of way.Man. I just wish my friend would just get back into her senses. >.<
-4	negative	work Confessions	so after 9 years togetherness of misery it 's coming to an end. and the new chapter in life will begin. i will miss my children dearly. but i have to go. she'll be fine or even better without me so she said. i dont why if god is real why why would you put any body thru all this.
-1	negative	work Confessions	So I'm coming to the end of a TERRIBLE breakdown I was literally afraid to watch TV for fear of losing control of my thoughts I was afraid of crying because I thought I would do something bad I was afraid to feel the hurt inside me I was afraid to feel the guilt over what I did I was afraid my coworkers could see that I was upset I'm still afraid that HE knows Well, I know he knows In fact, let him know. He's a jerk. But I want his attention. I don't think I've ever lost it this bad Geeze I was afraid of my own emotions
-17	negative	work Confessions	So me and this guy have been hanging out for almost a year we had both just gotten out of a relationship and ended up hanging out and fooling around. For the last few months I have pretty much been living here because he said he likes having me here. We had both decided that neither of us were ready for a commitment though.. Even though for the past few weeks I can feel myself falling in love with him.. I can't tell him because I am afraid that he will react bad since I know for a fact he is still not ready for anything serious.. Some days he tells me he is falling in love and others he doesn't but even when he tries hard not to I can still feel it by the way he looks at me and talks to me and makes sure I have a coffee ready in the morning.. It's really hard not to fall for him as he is my ideal match although there is an age difference of 10 years He's amazing and I want more then anything in the world to be in his life for the rest of our lives
-4	negative	work Confessions	Someone asked me once how it felt to   someone that doesn't love you back, I replied "It's like hugging a cactus. The harder you hug the more it hurts"
-4	negative	work Confessions	someone doesn't want your advice, they are not going to take it. Sometimes, we know what is best for others, and other times they know what is best for themselves. It's a fine line. No one knows what it is like to be someone else. They may understand or empathize from a similar experience, but they will never know completely.
-1	negative	work Confessions	Someone rear ended me today.now my car is screwed up.great way to end the week,huh?
-1	negative	work Confessions	some spiritual guidance. My something or others are all out of whack.
-3	negative	work Confessions	Sometimes I fantasize about leaving my husband who takes for granted all the things I do for him. I picture him coming home from work and all my stuff is gone! He has to come home to a cold empty house with no dinner awaiting him. As the weeks go by, with no sign of me around, his dirty underwear and all the other laundry that I slave to finish everyday is slowly piling up around him. Somehow it became my job to keep house, cook, help my son with his homework while completing a 40 hr. work week at my full time job, where I actually get paid to do crap that I don't want to. Do I sound a little bitter about being taken for granted? YOU BET!!
-1	negative	work Confessions	Sometimes I wonder if anyone truly cares.
-2	negative	work Confessions	Sometimes I would rather pleasure myself than let my boyfriend try to do it for me.
-5	negative	work Confessions	Sometimes when I am getting dressed I hold my boobs down and look at myself from a profile. I wish I looked like that. I like my breasts. But clothes that I love are just not for girls with large breasts. I prefer my fashion to my boobs.
-13	negative	work Confessions	Somewhere some how you have been lied to about me. I know of one person.someone in my family who has bald face lied about me. The thing is, it's lies. These lies seeped into your mind and now everything about me now is tainted. Just plain messed up. You hate me. You do a good job of hiding it to draw me in. And of course I want to believe everything's ok. But, it isn't.Somehow some way you think I have ruined your life. That's just not true. Life, my life is hard enough without the person I fell in live with treating me like crap. It's not right. It isn't. I don't need someone slamming me unexpectedly for no reason.especially under these conditions. I'm sorry for what I did do and say wrong which hurtbut DAMN, your pay back.I'm done. Just done. I wouldn't want to see you if you wanted to see me. Why waste my time. You will NOT stop hating me and it wont change. I wont forget this time. I hope all goes will for you. Good luck. There's nothing else to say.

-1	negative	work Confessions	so my friend could test her man on ok Cupid. Now I feel badly that real men are contacting "me".
-5	negative	work Confessions	sorry you didn't allow comments,but i feel strongly about this.. since i know that feeling all too well..its been haunting me since birth..BUT..we have a saying;rien ne se perd, rien ne se cre.. meaning, all things are.atoms. the same ones which always were, in different configurations.the chicken is the egg as a fish. if that makes any sense.i know its a shame to waste this wonderful world we were so blessed to witness.but as we speak endless wonderful worlds are being born.all things run their course & morph. its inevitable.if we didn't provoke it, something else would. gradually.i could go on on this subject forever.
-1	negative	work Confessions	So tapping my shoulder, a tickled foot. A broken back filled with words in a backpack. Stacks so high I can see the dimming ordinary lights, from ordinary times. Oh little prayer won't concede, to ever floating and courage. I can't see past the current, past afar off into the starry night cascading through a rim separating off into a billion miles. Crashing tides, for a drop of pebble shimmering under a pond. Oh leave it to the prayer maker, oh seek for the summer lover marching in single file.
-18	negative	work Confessions	So, there is this guy, and he goes to my school. He's in a few activities with me, and he goes to my church. I feel different about him then i have felt with other guys. Like, with other guys, I'm like "Well i like you, but im kinda scared i wont be myself with you." but with him im like "well i like you, and i just wanna go out with you because you already know who i really am." But the thing is, I dont know if he likes me back And i asked my friend to ask his friend if this guy likes me, and other people dont think he does like me, and im afraid if he says no my hearts gonna break. And i know God wants me to be happy, and that everything happens for a reason, but im afraid i cant take another heartbreak What should i do?
-12	negative	work Confessions	So, there was a gang of guys who were mostly drunk. Their main timings were  midnight, when they drank so much, they loose control of themselves!  So, my friends told me to bust them and made a plan. So, when I acted  according to plan. The black guy got angry n crazy, turned around n punched on  my face! That was the first ever time I must have thrown a fit! I hate them all!  They all abused me very bad n my friends just ran away
-20	negative	work Confessions	so when I waited tables, any time a customer got obnoxiously picky about the wine brands, I secretly served them our cheap house wine; I found it amusing when I did my routine follow up to ask how the wine was and they raved about how delicious it tasted and how superior it was.I was caught once and that is one lady I have some serious respect for. She was the only person in 5 years of serving wine who has ever noticed.And to the customers who ordered La Crema just because it was $10 per glass - that doesn't mean the wine is any "finer." You can actually buy the exact same bottle we serve at Walmart for $12. The restaurant I worked for is ripping you off because you're too ignorant to know any better.
-12	negative	work Confessions	So, you happily receive the   I have for you and just merely stroll on by, happy that you've been loved? Is that IT?!!!!I get days when your distance hurts so much that I wish you'd never contacted me in the first place. Yes, for sure, I love you. And I'd do anything for you.But your distance hurts me so much more than words can say. If this is love, then it's one sided. I love you. I couldnt save myself from falling for you and this distance seems so cruel.If I could I'd tear out my heart and it's passions.
-3	negative	work Confessions	STOP making fun of MarkHawk! He's not a troll, he's the love of my life!

-4	negative	work Confessions	Thank you for your post on how the ambiguity of the Internet leaves so much room for the devil to step in and wreck havoc on lives.  That's exactly what's happened In my life.   This is breaking my heart to go through something so painful, surely, I must be in hell.  If only others could see this pitfall, if only.    I can't do anything but cry.  Computers can't take the place of humans.
-3	negative	work Confessions	That idea of mine is getting really popular among people and I have no effin idea how to put it to completion because the rest of the team is a couple and they're always together and I feel like I'm getting in their way.And Workload is a term too little and so on.>:[
-6	negative	work Confessions	that I'm not doing all of this contacting immigration lawyers, and looking up jobs for you here, if all you are doing is pretending again. I only got 4 and a half hours of sleep last night. Me! The MS girl. Do you really want me to have yet another relapse again because of you? I could go blind! Or never be able to walk again! Or both. Just remember that please.
-8	negative	work Confessions	That is how I feel about her. She has finally crossed the line andI really do want to put my hands to her scrawny throat and SQUEEZE thil she stops breathing. I wish she had not got me so angry, I'm just tired of her taking advantage of our hardearned dollars. I may not be rich, or have lots f money laying around waitingto be spent..but I do have my integrity and i PAY my friggin' bills, on time every time, month after month. WE feed our family and keep the cars insuredShe is a stingy, self centered kind of ** with no reason to live. She is a miserable, lonely, can't-get-laid, who don't know how to match her lipstick so she always looks like aCLOWN.I did not want to be friends with her --from the start, moslly 'cause she presents herself as a weak, pathetic woman and that is totally against my nature.I just ain't feelin' her. And I ain't goin' to!!
-7	negative	work Confessions	That it may have happened. That I may have had my dream come true. It hurts so much right now. It hurts in a way I can't quite describe. I just want to crawl into a hole. I don't want you to see me this way. I'm pathetic.
-1	negative	work Confessions	That I   you and with or without you there is no one for me but you.  You are the only one I want to spend on my time with.  I give my whole heart to.  You.
-4	negative	work Confessions	That thought it was okay to mess up three years of filing and program details I WILL KILL YOU. I WILL CHOP YOU UP. I WILL SEND YOU BIT BY BIT THROW THE SHREDDER. Who do you think you are messing up my teen program? TURN PEOPLE DOWN?? ARE YOU SERIOUS?? Don't bother keeping hcarting notes or case files.

-20	negative	work Confessions	The last time I cut I was 13 and I was struggling with an eating disorder. I got help and I thought I had put it past me. Life had been going well for a while but I was never actually happy. I am now 16 and the other day I just wasn't feeling anything at all. For a while I haven't been getting a thrill out of things nor do I look forward to things or get excited. However this day in particular was much worse. It really was for no reason at all I was just blank and detached and I grabbed for a razor and sliced the skin on my right forearm. It gave me a thrill, my hands shook and my pulse quickened and after I felt relieved like I could breathe easier. I know many think people who cut do it for attention, maybe some do idk but Im ashamed of it. The first person I told was my "best friend" of 8 years who then turned her back on me because she didn't want to deal with it. It's been hard since then to trust people because I'm afraid theyre just going to walk away.
-8	negative	work Confessions	The missing piece of ourselves we all search for is in our own soul. It's within us, not outside of us.That's why all the endless searching for the right person is a waste of time. Only you can make you happy.Another person can make you happy for a period of time, but if you aren't happy with yourself, you will end up unhappy in that relationship, eventually.As with everything in life, there is no ideal and love is no different. friends Confessions
-14	negative	work Confessions	The news, the internet, the TV, music, books.  Anything I came to read, to watch, or to listen to.  Imagine living like that for long stretches of time. It could lead to being narcissistic, or worst, paranoid. Sometimes I would think something and then observe a similar situation in the news.  I would think they were related and consequently think I was important, that I was affecting the world just by thinking. We have a word for this in my family: connecting i.e.  connecting ideas and unrelated thoughts and instances into something meaningful, imbued with weight, importance, sometimes affecting personal histories.  My family would say, You are connecting again. And I would check myself.  But usually, it would not last and I would begin thinking worse thoughts than before, this time incorporating that my family was in on it too. The circle of culpability would grow wider and wider.  First it was the family, then it would be the neighbourhood, then half the world.
-4	negative	work Confessions	The   of my life just asked another girl to prom when I thought he was going to ask me <3
-5	negative	work Confessions	THe one I left behind, my mistake! It was my mistake to walk away and shut the door on you. I find year's later, I still love you! Do you still love me? probably not. Am not dealing with this too well. I hate these feelings i have for you, my heart is turning on me. Am the one that left you behind, am stuck with these hurt feelings and regrets. But one thing is certain, I'll always love YOU! As each day passes, our feelings are becoming more of the past every day. friends Confessions

Even with the good, I am lost, I am scared, and I don't know how to interact with some of these humans who can only be described as evil. I am doing my best, to do the things that you have asked of me and I am so very sorry for falling short. I will continue to help those who are unable to help themselves and take care of this earth you gave us. I'm sorry I've been so rotten to you at times of extreme frustration and stress. I don't want to resent this amazing experience of life, I want to enjoy as much as I can.

Why did they twist my story around and making seem like I have a bad reputation? Hurt worst because these are my actually blood family. The guy and I are nothing but cool people. I like him, but I know he's off limit. I am truly hurt because they lied on me and now my mom think I actually had an affair with dude. She knows him as well. She know I am no way like that. Just hurt that they said they didn't care about me and i'm not family. My heart is fluttering. Why is people upsetting me at the wrong time???? I think i'm just stressed out and need to get away from my hometown for a while.

-5	negative	work Confessions	This morning I woke up with his arm wrapped around me. When my thoughts drifted to you, I didn't get that horrible thought where I wanted you there instead and felt guilty for it. I just remembered you for a second. Then I about something else, maybe wondered if we had milk, and enjoyed his company, for the first time in a long time. friends Confessions
-7	negative	work Confessions	This personal longing I have has began its tendency to linger. There are other important aspects in my life at the present time, but I constantly see people holding hands or talking to each other along with the occasional signs of public affection. Will it ever come some day? I can only hope andtry (have tried, but no success at least as of yet which can lead to discouragement).
-1	negative	work Confessions	those who have treated you like a nobody? funny Confessions
-7	negative	work Confessions	Throughout the entire night, one part of you was always touching one part of me, as if to remind yourself that you werent alone, and that I was still there.With you. Only, always, forever, with you.Wed sleep side by side, spooning, my  parked into your crotch, my head planted under the crook of your neck, your chin resting on top of my unruly hair; one arm beneath me, and the other arm wrapped tightly over me, cupping the underside of my breast, with your hand held tightly by my hand, right under my cheek.Other times, wed switch positions, so you were lying on your back, and your chest was my pillow, and your arm was wrapped in the groove of my waist, and my leg was draped over your leg. We were splayed out like majesty in the kingdom of our bodies.

If he falls asleep out in the living room watching tv I used to wake him up and have him come to bed. I don't do that any more. I leave him out in the living room and I stretch out in the bed and love every second I am all by myself.

May you wake with a smile and hope for the next day. Sleep well my dear, we'll meet again soon. Comfort found in your arms, fantasy and wishes will play like movies in the back of my mind There's nothing better, though sometimes I wish I could trade those dreams for a life with you that I so much hope for.

I am sad.what happened? when did I give up? why????the color in life has faded, I skirt by, I pretend.., I am in my 40's now, time went too fast, I regret so many things, I made these choices, this isn't what I wanted my life to be.
-1	negative	work Confessions	whenever i see a story of someones life worse than mine i feel worse about everything. im such a horrible person for hating my life when others would love to take my place..
-20	negative	work Confessions	When I fell for you believe me when I say that nobody could have loved you more, you could have moved on and been happy with me, we'd be in love and happy and raise a happy. But you still lived with your ex and she she still controlled you, so you led me on, I don't think you meant to do it, I think you truly did love me back and probably still do, but there is so much a girl can take. We flirted on and off for years, and when you said you liked me and would like to raise my daughter with me, I realized that you are a good man that would raise Callie and love her like your own if it made me happy. But more importantly I realized that I don't love you anymore, You're sweet, romantic, funny, and remarkably handsome but you waited too long and now I just don't love you like I used too.
-3	negative	work Confessions	When I see Him the first thing I want to do is grab your face and kiss you till we need a breath. I want to take you to my room and be with you for ever. I hope to keep you near me and never have to let go. I want to sleep completely naked, with our legs entangled. I have to hold my self back when you walk into the room so I don't undress you there. You make me feel so warm inside I don't know what to do with my self. no matter what you do I can't help but try to remember every little thing so that I can tell our kids (if we marry) what you were like. I want to have you children and be your wife.
-1	negative	work Confessions	when i see you. your face will get r o c k e d . and ill tell you why afterwards. like you don't know.
-2	negative	work Confessions	when it comes to parents raising monsters. They hover and micro-manage, creating helpless and frustrated kids. Their materialism and obsession with career means doing everything for the kids to make it faster, easier, and less likely to be "messy". No manners or limits are taught, and when the kids are egregious in public, these parents honestly believe their kids are "cute" and ought to be the center of attention; even if the spotlight is for being destructive and demanding and loud. There's little quality time or realistic evaluation of the child - and when they fail it is "the school's fault". Or society just doesn't understand how SPECIAL they are. But they have internalized this and are the little queens and kings of ENTITLEMENT. Just like their parents, these kids judge and devalue others and take take take without ever thinking of giving. They protect what is theirs, like their cold parents.
-5	negative	work Confessions	When I was about three( my parents were and still are together)I went to see my dad because my back hurt so I walk into his room and told him and he's like ok take off your clothes.after all my clothes were off the leaned me over on the bed and he had no clothes on now and he was on top of my back and after a few minutes he got off because my mom came home and he told me to put on clothes so I did years later when I was eleven i was crying and he couldn't stop me and he KISSED me and I was so shocked I stop crying because I didn't want another now I'm not even sure if he did that to me when i was younger but I mean I didn't make it up that's for sure I'm just really scared

-5	negative	work Confessions	Why are there so few intelligent, articulate people on EP? Most people can not write at all correctly, and the insights of the vast majority are so dim as to be unsettling. I am a member of MENSA - I realize that we are a minority, (you must score within the top 1% of the nation on acceptable aptitude tests and other acceptable IQ tests), however, it really seems that few people here are just simply using the skill sets they DO have. I don't understand. friends Confessions

-12	negative	work Confessions	Why do I find myself lonely when so many people out there like me and I have the perfect chance to choose the right people all the time. why do i always choose the wrong people and then repent. What can I do to attract just that one person who is right for me into my life? just one is all i need - not all the wrong ones. Why being nice feels like such a pain in the . When can i stop crying and just be happy with someone who loves me and whom i love. is it true that all this wait will be worth it? No this is not a confession - more like me venting out all that is not letting me sleep. Relationships is the hardest part of my life. will i ever get any better at this? will i ever get anyone after meeting whom all this negativity will go away and all that I achieve and have will become more valuable because i can share it with someone I love.
-13	negative	work Confessions	Why is it ok for overweight women to bash thin women? I hate how theey walk around now like they are what all women are supposed to be. Eating all the time is not a sign of a good woman. The fact that you don't care about your appearance is weakness. Celebrities main job is to stay in shape for the camera they are not superhuman. Its their profession. I could gain weight and get fat but Idont want to. I weigh a little more than i did in highschool after having twins Ilike my body and don't want to get huge. Every female I know is over 200lbs. I notice they flirt more and get more attention. If I acted the way they act Iwould be considerd promiscuous..I understand the new freedom but Ithink it comes down to men think fat women are easy and not beautiful. friends Confessions
-4	negative	work Confessions	Why is it that when I want you to call me, to email me, to want to be with me, you are never there? Now so much time has gone by, so much hurt has caused me to feel numb towards you. You still pick fights with me and get on my nerves. I wish you would just leave me alone a while. Let me breathe and work on me a bit. I was looking forward to this break from you, but I feel more like I am being suffocated by you. I don't look forward to my time with you when you act like a child.

-4	negative	work Confessions	Will you please stop writing anonymous confessions about yourself. (good and bad)  It is obvious and quite obnoxious.  Please stop!  I know it's your attempt to make people think your special and everything but (sorry) your really not all that special.
-5	negative	work Confessions	Wow what can I say I fell hard, I thought it would be impossible to fall for someone so hard again. I wonder why I didn't think with my head. I am very sadly disappointed u didn't fight for the relationship which goes to show there was obviously nothing on ur side worth fighting for. On the plus side life does go on . :-)
-6	negative	work Confessions	Yes, I will   "I do" when you ask me to marry you. I am completely blown away by you, I love you so deeply. I can't believe how excited I am about our future together. and really, your life and your baggage should scare the h-e-l-l out of me. But I won't be scared away.

-11	negative	work Confessions	You are just disgusting. The reason I broke up with you actually has nothing to do with what I said but actually because you're a disgusting human being. I didn't want to explain why to you so I lied. The last time we got intimate I was noticing a smell and a nasty one. When we got into things I noticed between the crevice between your butt and male bits there was a ton of dried poop. SERIOUSLY????! How can you not have know that was there?! TAKE A DAMNED SHOWER!!!! I also found your makeup which really disturbed me.I can't even think about you without gagging.
-3	negative	work Confessions	You are mine. I long for you. To embrace you, touch you, holding you close, foreve, reminising on times forgotten, things in past, having no regrets. joyously reunited now after a time. No more tears, no more silence. Sorrow is now gone, happiness reigns, with white light in the end, bright light surrounding true love in loyalty and strength. Together as one, twin souls, best friends, always.

-4	negative	work Confessions	You are so formulaic. Sure you opted for the right profession? Not very creative. All you do is figure what buttons to push of whoever you are using / manipulating at the moment and push them. Maximum drama is what you go for and it's what you get never mind if it explodes in your face from time to time. I will be satisfied that you never figured out how to get what you wanted from me when you wanted and failed miserably after the fact at your whole hearted efforts to tear me down. You are a garden variety everyday psycho more common and spineless than a worm.
-3	negative	work Confessions	You broke my heart mercilessly.It doesn't beat anymore. It used get impatientwhenever I missed a chance to see you,talk to you. I don't feel anything now.It has become numb.I can only pray that it is not dead yet. friends Confessions
-1	negative	work Confessions	You can't know how I feel. How much of a fool I feel like. This only underscores every single insecurity I ever had. Tells me I will never be loved. Shows me I am nothing. It's not you, it's life. I can't take, I won't take any more pain.Go be happy. Please, it will be easier if you just pretend i am dead. Quite obviously I am and don't know I went to h*ll. All I as of God is for Him to be fair.
-1	negative	work Confessions	You completely systematically ruined my life.
-5	negative	work Confessions	you convinced me that i was crazy, that i NEEDED meds, that I would never be normal, and that i needed a god. but i've learned i dont. I can be happy without any of it. I'm going to start doing what makes me happy and not what you think will make me happy. I kind of hate you for it.
-2	negative	work Confessions	You could hold me right nowI miss you and you are all I think about..I'm afraid I'm losing you or maybe already have
-8	negative	work Confessions	You definitely think you're somehow above everyone else, I used to think you were as well until I woke up. I think you're a vulgar, disgusting pig. Mostly though you are the most arrogant person I've even had the misfortune to come into contact with.

-4	negative	work Confessions	You have no idea how much I want to drive over to your house, hug you, and kiss you all night. You are on my mind. You are in my heart. I desire you. I love you. Let the rain fall tonight as we lie in our beds, thinking of one another.
-2	negative	work Confessions	You know that feeling of endless, gnawing, aching pain, when you miss someone so much but there is no chance of seeing them any time soon? That feeling where you resent everyone around you because they are not the person you are longing for and you imagine all the freaking lucky souls surrounding the one you long for who probably don't appreciate that person like you would That hopelessness That just f**king?!#@?!#@?!#@?!#@?!#@?!#@?!#@?!#@?!#@?!#@?!#@?!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

-9	negative	work Confessions	You really were not someone that would be long term so I thought you would be fun.I feel dumb that I believed what you told me and I feel even more dumb for reading between the lines about what you said or how you felt and was completely wrong.I feel dumb that you were able to play me when I'm usually the one who plays. Now I know how my ex's really feel.I feel dumb that you know things about me now and that I opened myself up. Something I never do. How did you get me to do it?Why did I do it? Why did you share pictures and stories of your kids with me if you knew we weren't going to last?If you had so many others why did you invest the time in me? Maybe it wasn't a lot of time to you. Or maybe you didn't invest much of yourself.Who the * are you? and why the * did you pursue me for 5 months to * me over in the same amount of time? funny Confessions
-4	negative	work Confessions	Your right, but together we could find a solution, or at least a way to be there for each other till we figure it out. Maybe we should try and drop this silence. Just come back. Not here, you know where. All you have to do is say hi, and I will tell you everything.

-6	negative	work Confessions	you will never believe me. I do LOVE you. I can appreciate that after everything I have said, you will be inclinedto notbelieve me. My feelings for you have been always there. When Iinsulted you, I only end up hurting myself. I can understand completely if you do not believe or have trust in me :' ( TRUE LOVE forgives all wrongs, perhaps I have gone too far to fix up the damage : (
-4	negative	work Confessions	I don't know when I started doing it. I can be any place, with people or alone, at any time and I'll talk to myself. I was told byothers that I was crazy because I do this. Sense I didn't ask their opinion, I don't think I am. I do know that some times I get so lonely that I will talk to myself and it'll make me feel better. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy talking to people too, but they aren't always there for me.
-2	negative	work Confessions	I felt so sad and down and needed to talk to someone so I rang samaritans,  
-16	negative	work Confessions	My boyfriend just broke up with me, I m not really sure why. He didn t really tell me why. He just told me to move on.This was all by text, just days after telling me we were in this together. He wasn t going anywhere.We had been together a little over five months, and a text was apparantly all I am worth.I suppose he is interested in someone else, or just not interested in me. Just a text really just a text, is that all I am worth not even a real life conversation.Just as I was starting to trust him, just as I was starting to open up.I have terrible taste in men, I m tired of being hurt.I m tired of being alone, yet I see no other way. It s best I stay alone.
