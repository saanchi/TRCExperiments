1	positive	bipolar-disorder	All my life I have been chasing happiness. Yet it eludes me. Don't get me wrong, most times I feel genuine happiness and gratitude for what I have in my life. But I feel like my base temperament is more melancholy and anxiety-ridden than most people. I wish I could take that temperament and turn it up towards happiness like a dial. I also feel when I can truly love myself, then will I be able to experience true happiness. 
2	positive	bipolar-disorder	All of my emotions are fading away day by day. I don't feel sad if people get hurt. I don't enjoy it either. I just feel like my compassion is numb.
0	positive	bipolar-disorder	A lot of times, I feel like I am a good person. Well, I am a good person That is until you get on my bad side. I won't physically hurt you, of course not. I choose to take a more manipulative path when someone has displeased me. I am no saint, and often times I feel like the devil in my darkest hours. That's all negativity though; I don't want to be negative I just want to be happy.

4	positive	bipolar-disorder	And will never be. I make mistakes and learn from it. I disappoint people and make others feel bad but that does not necessarily make me a bad person. I do stupid stuff and enjoy crazy things but that doesn't mean I don't take things seriously. I maybe just like this.. not perfect.. but I am me.

0	positive	bipolar-disorder	Any of you ever wonder what it would be like to fall in love like the other people?  I think they're idiots but lately I've been wanting to know how could some emotion move the wise and sane into being such fools?  And why would someone want to actively search for that one person who would turn them into a fool themselves? Don't get me wrong, I'm not against love or whatever, so long as you keep your head.  Just a little curious is all..

0	positive	emotional-health	Emotions are so overrated by underestimations. People are afraid to create bonds because we fear what is to happen. We shouldn't let our fears dictate our actions. For once, I wish someone would approach me with the intentions of staying for more than a month. Lay with me, let us speak like young children. Ramble on to me until you're comfortable to speak sincere thoughts We can be each other's safety. If you feel overwhelmed press your heart against mine and let us stabilize ourselves on securities. I only wish to discover you in the near future.  Xo My Anonymous Lover

5	positive	emotional-health	How is a movie capable of completely destroying my mood. Its like i'm so complex i can relate to every character in every movie so their pain becomes my pain. It makes me feel worthless like i don't deserve love and the love i give isn't strong enough. How can a movie make me feel like that. How do i make it stop? Right now i feel like scum and everything i try to do to help just makes me feel worse. I hate feeling like this but i don't know how to make it stop. I feel empty and incredibly sad. I can tell i will probably have a breakdown soon and i don't know if i can handle a breakdown. All i know is that my mood needs to change before wednesday because this mood will terrify my fianc if she sees me like this.

2	positive	emotional-health	I always say i'm okay, i'm fine. But in reality, i'm not okay or fine!!! But some people, can't see that and are just like : "oh okay", even my family, can't see that i need them. And i dont know what to do anymore!!!! I feel like nobody cares, like if i disappeared, nobody would notice that i was gone!!! :''-(
1	positive	emotional-health	I am 35, and getting messages from boys that are as old as my oldest daughter who is 18.  Maybe I'm just being overly sensitive. Who doesn't want to be mistaken for someone younger?! I must be insane to be bothered by it!

1	positive	emotional-health	I am afraid I am gonna plunge into another depression I feel really alone tonight. I feel hopeless for the first time in a long time. It makes me feel like she will stop caring eventually. I try not to be needy, but she has changed and I feel her withdrawing. It breaks my heart. I feel so alone tonight.
2	positive	emotional-health	I am a junior in college. Ive always been an average/above average student. I do my work, study for exams, join clubseverything that im "supposed" to do. The thing is, I always feel like im not as good as everyone else. Whenever I do something good, I always attribute my success to luck. Even when I earned my full ride to college, I assumed I just got lucky.  I always feel like if I did it, then everyone else can do it too, and even do it better than me. I dont know why I think like this. I hate it. I wish I knew how to make myself feel worthy of achieving success because of my hard work rather than just feel like I got lucky. 
1	positive	emotional-health	I am an older gent with my share of experiences and understandingTry me.
0	positive	emotional-health	I am a teacher, so caring more about others than they do for me comes with the territory.  However, sometimes it gets super depressing.  It takes so much out of me, and others don't seem to care.  It's like they expect me to do and do and do for them, and that no effort or care is required by them in return.  I don't know any other way to be.
3	positive	emotional-health	I am being dead serious right now, I hate when people say "I'm sad, but I hide it with a smile". I know a lot of people actually suffer and try to hide it, but some people flaunt that line like it makes them special. The one's who are truly hiding behind a smile say nothing. They sit quietly as the pain they feel gets worse and worse. I don't want to hear that you're strong because you hide your sadness, no you are strong if you can confront your sadness. I feel sorry for the one's who truly hide behind a smile, because before anyone notices what's wrong they are to far gone. So for the boys and girls who are truly hiding I hope one day you find someone to open up to, for the one's flaunting this; if you feel like you need to hide then talk to someone. Don't tell people your hiding and not seek help.

3	positive	emotional-health	I can't believe I actually got here by trying to google "search for someone ready to care", whatever that means, and then "I want someone to care about me" because yes, at that moment I was so desperate for this that I wished I could stumble upon some place online where you just browse through people who are sitting there willing to care if you need it  *sigh* I don't even know what to say about the whole mess I'm in.I just know I still stupidly always wait for someone magical to step right up into my life and actually care forrealand then just save me out of all of this. I promise I'm ready to do just the same back, I'm ready to do so much for someone who's actually sweet and caring enoughI do it for so many people who don't really deserve it, why wouldn't I do it for someone that it'd be worth it for :/

0	positive	emotional-health	I don't feel like my age I actually feel younger I'm 15 but I don't act like it.  This is one of the reasons people think I'm younger they usually think I'm about 10-12 I don't really mind my friends know it they treat me like a kid sometimes. I'm older than them well by a few months but still. I just realized I make no sense.
0	positive	emotional-health	I don't know how.. About after a while I've had a friend I always end up pushing them away.. Because past events I don't feel I can't trust anyone or let anyone close to me, I'm afraid to get hurt .. And I know I will not know that person for long  I have problems with letting my guard down and it's affecting every relationship I have
0	positive	emotional-health	I don't know how I'm still functioning. My suicidal thoughts are paralyzing me tonight. I can't find a scrap of hope. It would be so much easier to just take some extra sleeping pills and fall into a never-ending sleep. Nights are getting worse.

0	positive	emotional-health	I don't know what is going on my life, on my head, on my heart, I'm tired of crying, and i can't be crying everytime i got home I'm stressed,nervous,pressed, and i can't handle all that they're doing I suppose to have a life with legs, but instead that, I'm having my past life returning again I'm losing everything I had, everyone is taking everything from me, I'm getting broken, in down under land I know that no one feels the same, neither had the same, some lucky others unlucky, but I'm confused, and getting confused, closed and locked day by day I don't know how I will scope my self up again, because i'm alone on my life But for those who read, even broken, I can tell to don't let anyone change your life, because if that happens, depending the change, be sure that is the best, be sure it will be the one that on your future you will say : 'I dodn't care how tough it was, I've just feel proud of my self!', because if that happens, our life is successfully accomplished forever!
1	positive	emotional-health	I don't know why this one incident is still on my mind because I know it shouldn't be, but I guess for me it reaffirmed the fact that the older I get the more I do indeed vanish into thin air around other people. And it hurts. I won't lie. It's funny, though, because in some places people are randomly social with me and in others I might as well be as clear as water as I awkwardly stand there, desperately trying to prove that I exist or wish that someone notices that I do. 
3	positive	emotional-health	I don't like when people try to fit me into their mold, their idea of what I ought to be.  They make suggestions like: Why don't you do thus and so, or why don't you wear this, why do you do that? If you don't like me the way I am, then you change your attitude.  I think if someone doesn't like me, it's their problem, their bias or prejudice or expectations that keep them from liking me.  I saw a quote on a coffee cup that said, "Be yourself, everyone else is taken." I forget who said it. Someone famous, I think.
0	positive	emotional-health	I don't think i'll ever let anyone know everything about me, it takes a long time to earn my respect. And even longer to earn my trust.

1	positive	emotional-health	I don't trust men I know that they're not all bad but I don't really trust them. As far as females I always keep my guard up and I'm always on watch because they low blow you the most.
2	positive	emotional-health	I don't want to talk about it. I just need someone to talk to me and take my mind off of things. Please.

2	positive	emotional-health	I feel like at times I am alone and I'm different. I don't have a lot of friends and sometime when I  get around a lot of people I feel uncomfortable. People treat me different and don't like me ,so I feel like everybody feels the same . I feel sad and depressed. I have a wonderful personality ,but I wish people could see it that way.  It just frustrating that people can't accept me for who I am.

0	positive	emotional-health	I feel like I bother people when I try to talk to them about problems that I really need help with. So much so that now instead of trying to tell anyone, I just keep it to myself and pretend to be happy, and hope that I that I get over it.

3	positive	emotional-health	I hate it when people don't understand why I'm upset. Sometimes, I get upset on some stuff said by my friends or parents and those words hurt me even if it was meant to be a joke. They think that I'm a too weak and emotional but they don't know what I've been thorough.  I wish I had an off button for my emotions!!
1	positive	emotional-health	I hate that I need anyone  If I could just be content with being alone, then I would be happy.  But I'm constantly seeking approval, constantly seeking someone to fill the empty places in my life. I just need to accept my lot in life. 
3	positive	emotional-health	I hate when people copy stuff I do. It sounds superficial right? Well i don't care.. I'm just bothered. A lot. Rant rant rant. Why can't people be original?
1	positive	emotional-health	I have been curled in a ball in room for days hurting so bad, I know the pain I am in I just can't escape it. The world is cold and lonely when you don't have that special person to just hold and whisper I need you.

I have to say I am really glad for the new job because I don't think as much. My mind is somewhat relaxed. I still miss seeing him on certain occasions but it's not as bad as before. I am in a much better place. Ohhhhhhhhhhe read my email (read my previous post). He said he was speechless throughout the entire thing. I don't know what will happen but I ain't got no worries ;p 
0	positive	emotional-health	I have self harmed and still do I have been recovering from cutting, but I have broke a few times, and wish I could just stay strong. I still harm in other ways, and I hate to be judged because I do self harm  You would never know unless I told you, I put on a smile and seem happy, but honestly I'm breaking inside. I hide them on my thighs and hips and I am not ashamed of my scars.
0	positive	emotional-health	I have so many problems with expressing myself to people. I don't know what to do because my boyfriend wants to know why I love him, why I care about him, and why he's special to me. Keep in mind we are coming up on our 11 months. But I don't know how open up to him to let him know everything. I'm also scared that I'll say something wrong and he will take it the wrong way. I just really don't know what to do and he even said if I don't talk about it soon I will lose him. And I really can't lose him ever I'm just scared and I really need help. Any suggestions? Please I will read what you have to say
0	positive	emotional-health	I have the sadness, which I can hide to an extent. Then there's the craziness/weirdness which I can't hide much at all. It's ok if I can't hide it, being crazy is a good thing.  I have other emotions and sides. These are just my main ones.

1	positive	emotional-health	It bothers me when someone cannot tell me how they really feel.  It makes me think they are emotionally immature or don't understand their own feelings or perhaps they really don't feel what they're claiming to feel if they cannot elaborate.  
1	positive	emotional-health	I think I do I can't take any more of this.  At all
1	positive	emotional-health	I think my biggest mistake, is that I distance myself from my  friends sometimes. But I only do it because I want to be left alone and I feel like that they don't get it.  Were constantly always together and in reality I want some new faces in this group of friends and it's very hard when some of them are so close-minded.

0	positive	emotional-health	I've always been taken with the 1980s. The clothes, hair, especially the music and movies. Even though I was born in 1995. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy some music from right here and now; Safe and Sound by Capital Cities is good, Daft Punk as well. But I can't help but roll my eyes when the take away the guitars and drums completely and use their computers to generate "wubs" and "dubs".

1	positive	emotional-health	I've never been the type of person to express my feelings, if anything  my emotions usually tend to show themselves through my facial expressions or how I act sometime. I never run to people to talk about how I feel, I just keep it all bottled up inside  Until I can't take it anymore and all of my emotions hit me all at once. That usually happens to me a lot. Which is why I keep a journal but  yeah, I'm having one of those days where  I'm sad,mad,depressed,etc all at once. I hate it .
0	positive	emotional-health	I've never been very good with people. I can handle one-on-one interactions with people I know well, but with groups of people I'm helpless. As for small talk with people I don't know well: forget it! I'm a loner by nature, so it's not much of a problem, but sometimes I wish I were better at making connections.

0	positive	emotional-health	Jealousy is such a powerful emotion. I rarely experience it, but when I do it consumes me.

I dealt with all of the medical and financial problems. I never had the opportunity to be upset or emotional about what happened cause I knew I had to be strong for him. But I can't be strong anymore. I am broken. I sit in my room all day cause I can't handle being around anyone, I concentrate all day on not crying, I can't think straight, I can't sleep but when I do I cry myself to sleep, I no longer enjoy doing photography, I don't spend time with my son anymore and I feel completely worthless and dead inside.

1	positive	emotional-health	Sometimes even if I sense the hurt coming. I back away. I stop returning calls and texts to guard my own heart. Once, I have been hurt by a person, they seldom get back in. It's not that I don't forgive, I don't trust that person anymore. Trust is a fickle thing, easy to lose, but hard to gain.  I have burned a lot of bridges in my life because I was hurt. I imagine there will be more.
0	positive	emotional-health	Sometimes i feel like i didn't live my childhood to the fullest. I grew up as an only child and there was a huge age gap between me and my parents. There were so many do's and dont's. Hanging around them so much made me prone to do what they do, like ordering coffee instead of a hot chocolate at cafes, wear clothes that look like i was going to run for office, etc etc. i didn't have many friends of my age because we moved around alot. Sometimes i wonder, if its weird or would i be "too old" to be playing with doll houses, wear abercrombie and fitch, paint colorful nails, etc. i guess i miss being young.

2	positive	emotional-health	This is a battle I struggle with everyday. It is so hard for me not to have emotional intimacy. I feel alone and depressed. It's like I need it to make it through the day. I need to be noticed and cared for. I need someone to talk to me even if it's about nothing. I feel so codependent because without that I get so sad. Like my world is going to crumble. It ruins every friendship I've ever had because I get so attached to that one person to the point they don't even want to deal with me anymore. Then I break down for a week and then pull it back together and get attached again. Never ending cycle. Just wish I could pull myself to the point I needed no one. Then I don't think I would be me. I feel like I'm a burden to everyone around me. I bother too much and ask for to much. I don't know what to do anymore. I can't afford to lose anyone else in my life. I've lost almost it all already.

0	positive	emotional-health	Where does one even start when they have been afraid of anything and everything as long as they can remember. It doesn't help to know that it was likely beyond my control as it was ingrained from my earliest days-I should have the strength to overcome those early wounds, but I don't. I try to tell myself I could stand my ground if a loved one was in imminent danger, but never having been in that situation it's just a fairy tale I use to ward off being the worst of the cowards, although I'm pretty certain I am anyway. There is no depth to which my cowardice has been tested that I have not stooped, and the only tests I pretend I would pass are those I will likely never face possibly because I'm such a coward in the first place? A coward dies a million deaths, while a soldier dies but one truer words have never been spoken.

1	positive	health Confessions	I have a somewhat scary habit. When I am stressed or afraid or in anyway upset I hide. Right now if I didn't have a job (thank God I do) I would never leave my bedroom, let alone my apartment. Money has been so tight and hard to come by since I was laid off in 2008, that most of the time I don't have much grocery money, or much gas money to get to and from work. I support four other people on my income alone. Those people are the ones that make me feel like a loser, like I am not a good provider, role model, mother. It sucks to feel so totally alone in this world. I have no close family (besides my household) and no friends irl. I shoulder life alone and I am not confident that I can do it much longer.

I'm never pretty enough even when I try RRALLY REALLY hard! My friends all get hit on at the bar constantly. But me, it never happens.  I am treated like an invisible loser.

1	positive	health Confessions	I know it's probably not the worst problem out there but I am truly done with this. There will be leftovers in the fridge and I will eat those leftovers. Someone will them go into the fridge and say " Those where for dinner.." or " I was going to put that in my lunch..". Seriously, why did you not put a note on it then? I can't read your mind and I don't know what you want to eat and not eat. If you don't place a note on something or tell me face to face about what I shouldn't, then don't expect it to be there the next time you look.

1	positive	health Confessions	I live a healthy lifestyle keeping myself on track. I am a vegetarian and exercise on a regular basis along with havingmy undergrad. I stay away from fatty foods and needless sugar and calorie content. I do not think I look unattractive; yet, the feeling of beingseen as inferiorremains. I feel like I do not "fit the bill" according to societal standards/expectationsin spite ofnot living unhealthy. I am not tall (nieces and nephews taller than I) and have a disability preventing me from obtaining a driver's license. I feel like at times if one does not meet all the requirements forwhateverreason, they might as well give up. I want to think that I can be accepted for who I am (not just physically), but lifeoften gets lonely.

I'm sorry I like things that have to do with Japan and anime, but I can never ask you to go to a convention because you say they're "pointless" and the instant answer is no. I dress the way I do because I merely like it, but I can tell you hate that I don't dress girly and have rainbows on my shirt.

0	positive	health Confessions	There comes a time in my life where women no longer hold any meaning for me from a purely romantic point of view. They lie to me, they cheat on me, they steal from me and they refuse to even attempt to get along with my kids. I'm done. I've had it with women and their lies. I gave up on looking for a relationship months ago, and I'm through with women. All I ever get is heartache.

Just to fall away into the sea, floating painlessly away into loving oblivion.

I don't know what to do and I'm pretty sure I'm close to having a panic attack. I can't just wake up my brother or my step dad because I am known for overreacting but what if I'm right?! I'm assuming the graduation is in the school, which is the shadiest place I've seen, some drug dealers hang around near the school and it's around that time of the year when people start getting mugged and murdered! She couldn't be in a bar or with friends because if she was she would have told me before she left, or called if she made any plans. She's the only one in the house with a cellphone so calling her isn't an optionI'm scaredthere's no way I'm going to be able to sleep like thisI don't know what to do! Im panicking and I just don't know what to do!
0	positive	loneliness	Having a hard time lately. Mom of three, just need an adult to talk to. It's strange isn't it, how I feel more comfortable talking to a complete stranger than my family or few friends. Some days I feel like I'm trying to crawl out of my own skin. I love my kids more than anything but I have this nagging feeling that there is something else I need to be doing while being an awesome mom to my kids. Anyone feel that way?

0	positive	loneliness	Honestly if some people stepped in my shoes, they couldn't handle my struggles.
5	positive	loneliness	How can I be so lonely, when I'm surrounded by people? I've felt this way for a while now and it doesn't seem to be going away. I'm so lucky and have so many good things in my life, but I'm lonely. I don't know how to get rid of this feeling. Even when I'm with the people that usually stop the loneliness I still feel this way. It just won't go away and I'm so tired of this feeling, I just need it to go away. 
1	positive	loneliness	How can I break my habit of procrastinating ?
1	positive	loneliness	How exactly does one beat loneliness?  What about when you feel alone, despite being surrounded by friendly people? How do you learn to let people in? To be okay with yourself, in spite of insecurities? To clarify an imagined, warped self-image? How can I do these things?

0	positive	loneliness	I am new to the forum! I live in ireland!  I have recently left a very abusive marriage ! As he was a drinker ! The past few years have been hell! I have been so embarrassed and felt a duty to hide what was going on! I isolated myself from friends and family as I did not want people to judge me or pity me! I think I had an image of how life should be and I blamed myself for ignoring some strong signs before we married! I feel I lost the battle with drink to because it took my marriage and my family and my dreams of us!  I am trying to rebuilt and move forward in a healthy way! I don't feel anger but sad and lonely especially when my 8 year old is asleep! I would love to know if anybody had any positive advise on how they restarted their life!
1	positive	loneliness	I am not lonely, in the sense of the word. I am lonely, in the loss, I feel at this moment, in being alone with the pain and misery, of not having the answers, the ability to understand how to get through this.

0	positive	loneliness	I am very lonely i am 32 yrs old and what you call super obese (785lbs)I don't have many friends. Looking to talk with someone 
0	positive	loneliness	I am writing this having spent the evening at a party in the company of family, relatives and acquaintances, and I never felt so alone in my life. I so wish I could feel on the same level as others, I wish I was good enough to be wanted, to be able to give of myself. To feel this cold, numbing and ever-present loneliness is too much to bear, especially in stark contrast to the joy and laughter felt by others around me. I wish I could explain how destroyed I feel, why I am unable to socialize in a carefree way like everyone else. But then, who would want to know me, anyway.
0	positive	loneliness	I been feeling anxious and lonely lately, I wish I had someone to talk to.

2	positive	loneliness	I can just sit in my room and listen to music and just lay on my bed or try on clothes and dance around or skate in my room. It's not much space but it's enough to be able to move. It's so nice to be alone with yourself and your silliness and your music sometimes.

3	positive	loneliness	I can't believe I actually got here by trying to google "search for someone ready to care", whatever that means, and then "I want someone to care about me" because yes, at that moment I was so desperate for this that I wished I could stumble upon some place online where you just browse through people who are sitting there willing to care if you need it  *sigh* I don't even know what to say about the whole mess I'm in.I just know I still stupidly always wait for someone magical to step right up into my life and actually care forrealand then just save me out of all of this. I promise I'm ready to do just the same back, I'm ready to do so much for someone who's actually sweet and caring enoughI do it for so many people who don't really deserve it, why wouldn't I do it for someone that it'd be worth it for :/

2	positive	loneliness	I don't have much friends and I really like to have some one to talk to .
4	positive	loneliness	I don't know how to fix my isolation. I'm unbalanced between myself and everyone I interact with. I can't seem to carry a conversation properly with people I don't have a lot in common with. Even people I get along with, they just aren't caring enough like I am to them so I keep my distance from them. I feel so empty and meaningless because of my social suppression. I feel so alone and I feel that nobody understands how I feel.
1	positive	loneliness	I don't know what to do, I am lost, I've made a terrible mess of my life over just two days. My existence in this world annoys me, I feel I am a huge pathetic waste of space. I am odd, and feel horrible about myself, especially now. 
0	positive	loneliness	I don't know what to do right now. I just found out that one of my closest friends is having a sleepover right this very minute. Her and her guests have been posting pictures on Instagram all night. Frankly, I'm a little upset I was excluded. She is one of my best friends and she didn't invite me. Yes, this is petty. But is anyone willing to over look the pettiness and maybe help give me some advice? :/
3	positive	loneliness	I don't know what to do with my life Which career path I should take.. I'm really confuse

2	positive	loneliness	I don't know why, but I'm having an especially hard time right now, right this second. I feelI don't even know. I just can't sleep, and I can't help but feel like no one truly cares. I just want someone to carelike no other! Like a friend. But those seem to be impossible to find nowadays. UghI don't want advice or to be told what to do with my life, I want a friend. I appreciate everyone trying to help, but I just want a freakin friendsigh
1	positive	loneliness	I don't know why I get this way so often, but I do. I have a need for contact and interaction with others. Texting, talking, hugging, kissing, cuddling, doesn't matter, I just don't like to be alone if possible. It's so miserable.
1	positive	loneliness	I don't like being judged and rejected, so this is basically why I don't like being too weird and loud to people I don't really know yet, I don't get up on stage often or do all those competition things unless I'm sure I have a chance and not make myself look like a dummy haha same thing with guys and all that jazz
0	positive	loneliness	I don't like the weekends. For some reason they are harder then the week days. It just seems more empty. Thank Goodness its almost over. 
1	positive	loneliness	I don't mind you talking to me, I'm more than happy to have a conversation with anyone. Just please no small talk. It's truly not your fault when it occurs. When someone small talks it makes me feel awkward and very uninteresting, only because I don't know how to respond to small talk.  Go ahead and inbox me, I might give you the time of the day for a decent conversation. You're more than welcome just please no small talk.  
1	positive	loneliness	I don't necessarily want to kill myself I just don't want to be in pain anymore I don't have a bad home or a bad background. But I've been fighting for so long for nothing. Some days are good Then the darkness comes in
0	positive	loneliness	I don't really have any friends ._. I don't leave my house and I'm always inside it doesn't really give me the opportunity to be a social butterfly..

1	positive	loneliness	I do this all the time lately. It isn't okay, and I know it. But I am so used to being the anchor for everyone else to lean on when things are looking down for them that I forget me. I push me and how I feel to the back burner. And then it just builds up.

1	positive	loneliness	I feel like I spent so much time trying to live up to everyone's expectations of normalcy that I really failed myself. Now, I have a marriage, a house, a career, and a college education. I got to this point everyone wanted to see me at and now what? This is not a point of happiness for me. I feel very alone. I do not have a single meaningful relationship, not even with my family. I need to make a life change, but changing any aspect of my life now would seem to be an inevitable disappointment to anyone who is actually in my life with no guarantee that I will even be any happier. It is hard to live day after day this way with not a single person knowing how I feel or truly caring how I feel. How can I make a positive life change or find any true connection?

I just want that someone special to share my life with and each and everytime it is the same situation.. is it because i am too guillible? too easy to lie and cheat to? i just don't understand it. I have no friends around me and just wish someone could relate to what i am going through.

I feel like I don't have any friends at college that I have enough in common with. I feel like I'm ugly. I feel like I'm going nowhere. I feel like I've wasted so much time. I feel afraid that if I don't do something I might end up making a mistake that costs me my future. I feel like i might never find a girl that I really care about. I feel like I try to do what's best, but i just can't manage to be fast enough to do what I need to do.  I can't take it anymore.

0	positive	loneliness	I have no choice. If I'm not strong I fail. If I'm not okay I let him down. I make things harder for him. My pain is a distraction for him. Distractions can be life or death. I choose his life. So I choose to pretend. But I hurt. I'm scared. I'm alone. I miss him. I miss physically being together. Entwining our fingertips. I miss his laugh. I miss him. But I cannot be sad. I must be strong. I'm an army girlfriend. I must say I'm okay.

0	positive	loneliness	I live with my husband and adult son. My husband is closed-minded, so he can't understand my point of view when we talk. My son is 20 and in college. We use to talk a lot when he was younger. Now I can't get him to discuss anything with me. I don't have any friends because I have Asperger's syndrome  and  panic episodes to deal with. It's hard to chat because I can't remember how to spell a lot of words (Google helps with that). Writing is difficult too, because the words get all mixed up in my head.
4	positive	loneliness	I'm 19, soon to be 20. Man, I really don't have anybody to talk to anymore.everyone's gone their own way, and the people who I considered "friends" weren't ever really my friends. I've always been a loser, a loser nobody ever wanted to hang out with. I wish I had someone to talk to. I wish I could find an artist for the various projects I have in mind.but sometimes life doesn't work that way. They never seem to appear when you really need em. And well, I really need someone in my life. I don't want to be alone anymore.

0	positive	loneliness	I'm not going to lie but I do feel alone. I seriously don't really talk to alot of people. Sometimes I wait for people to talk to me but yeah. I'm not afraid to ask questions. Like when I'm at work I don't feel like I'm connected to them I mean I'm really nice and everything but I'm not close to them. And I wish my therapist didn't go I really miss talking to her because she would totally understand me. I don't feel like I have friends to talk to at school. I feel alone.
1	positive	loneliness	I'm not one of those people who needs to be surrounded by others, I don't like party's or crowded places. I never was a fan of small talk. I'm very happy spending time alone, without being lonely.
2	positive	loneliness	I'm not perfect what so ever but you never had to hurt me like that, I did nothing to you I did mess up but I'm sorry because I know I can't even begin to fix any of this  but you hurt me so much that just don't know anymore.
0	positive	loneliness	I'm not sure if I miss him or I just miss what we had and what we might have had? I know he's toxic yet I can't seem to let go & move on. I hate to admit this but after 13 months I'm still not over him, I feel like a fool. My soul feels empty 
0	positive	loneliness	I moved to a new city recently and don't know anyone.  I don't get much human interaction aside from at work.  I am quite sociable and not knowing anyone or having anyone to talk to is killing me
1	positive	loneliness	I'm really sad tonight. Life's been too hard lately, and long before, too. I feel like I've been struggling in one way or the other for so long. I feel like I'm different than other people, things hurt me a lot and people tell me to shrug it off or just to think differently about what hurt me; I don't think that's fair or right. I've lived for a long time under the assumption that it will get better eventually But I'm not sure I believe that anymore. So now I don't know how to make life work and be okay and at the very least have some peace (I don't know if I can be happy) because I don't believe in much of what I used to believe in. I also don't feel I can tell anyone around me, because they just judge me or tell me to go take medicine, or tell me I'm wrong, and none of that helps.

0	positive	loneliness	I'm struggling with the idea that I need to be with someone. I've been mostly single for almost 5 years after coming out of a 5 year relationship and I cannot get past the feeling of being lonely because I do not have someone there. Even a friend. I feel like everyone has someone they are connected to and I don't. I'm not necessarily looking for someone to fill this void, but I'm looking for some advice from someone outside of the people who know me.

1	positive	loneliness	I suffer from a condition called Cystic Fibrosis, it's very hard to live with at times and brings a great amount of stress on my family and I.  It's took me a lot of courage to post this as I am not really comfortable with telling people about it however, if I don't say it now then that's another secret to add to the pile and I have no intention of keeping it a secret any longer. I am happy with myself.. For now anyway

4	positive	loneliness	I take solace in my introverted personality and behaviors, but at the same time, I'm afraid of where I'll be in the future. I'm afraid I might not have anyone, but at the same time, I'm afraid of the idea of having people that are close to me. I don't like it when people say they don't know what they'd do if I died or something happened to me(my mother and brothers specifically). I don't want to hurt them and while I appreciate how they feel, I almost don't want their affections. I want love, but I don't. I want friends, but I don't. I want to be noticed by the world, but I don't
0	positive	loneliness	It can be very lonely and painful to take a stand by shutting someone out but if I can't be shown the same respect that I give a person then that's most likely gonna be the result and I've never really been all that nice about it but all I have in life is my good name. I'm not afraid to admit that to me it's a matter of self defense,survival and yes pride too.

I'm always smiling and they are used to it. They feed off of it and I can't let them down. How could I ever be so selfish as to put my problems out into the world, but I feel so alone.

0	positive	loneliness	My husband had me believing it was my fault that he was unhappy. I believed this for most of 27 years of marriage. I still feel it's my fault when he yells at me too often. Things have been pretty good for the past month, but I know the blaming can start at anytime. I need to hear from  people who are on my side and understand how I feel. That helps me to not blame myself for his unhappiness.

But I did not know better when I got my period and went a year with constant bleeding because I thought it was normalit almost killed me!

And for those in wheelchairs, they can't help that either. Me for example, I'm a disabled handicap with no girlfriend no real friends or a real life. And besides people don't see the up side to us handicapswe can protect our women more then the walking people can by running them over. But just wait, people that mess disabled people will soon possibly turn out like them. Maybe not today or tomorrow, but soon and everyone that might get rid of their disabilities will eventually come across that person and pick on them

4	positive	loneliness	The feeling of loneliness is it ever, or even often, our fault, given that crowd? Some people feel bummed out-- I know I have-- when not understood. How much effort's really being applied to being understood though? No one's psychic. So many different ways to interpret and mean things. Language is subjective to each person, and it can take some time to learn someone's patterns and how they mean things: their personal language. How often is feeling lonely choosing distance over trying to understand someone else? If we don't feel understood, what if we do? What if we just don't understand, sometimes? What if you have four choices: Be understood, understand, mutual distance, or mutual understanding? Which would you choose? Does at least understanding another dissolve your loneliness?
0	positive	loneliness	The house is so quiet , peaceful, listening to my sons laughter on his video, the house feels full, the candles burned all night and still going, I feel him here, I'm loving it, I feel like a little walk, so I'm going to do that, probably go to the laundry and wash up my spreads, Its ok, that's what I want to do, because its so peaceful, I made me a little dinner , Baked chicken Brest, stuffing, Cranberry, string beans and a cake after, Its not like the dinners I used to make , but its good enough for me, the house still looks like Christmas, with the little things I put up, but its a new way to do things, a set up for one and my spirit child, I had a little eggnog last night and still poured a glass out for my son and put by his picture, I cheered the holiday to him, Nothing changed, he is here in spirit, I'm going to enjoy this new feeling I'm feeling and hope I can experience more of this through out my remaining years.

2	positive	loneliness	Wahhh I need to talk to some guys If you leave your gf you've been with for 2 years for your ex would you regret it ?
1	positive	loneliness	We all mistakes. Some are more serious than others, some follow us around for the rest of our lives no matter what we do to try to make up for it. I made a mistake with that type of consequence. I have learned from it and I regret it deeply, like others like me if I could go back in time and change it I certainly would. I would have never done those things, I would have never said those things, I would never have let things go that far I wouldn't have even let them start. Some people are nice enough to try to convince me that it is not my fault. Others tell me it's not COMEPLETELY my fault. Most aren't nice at all and tell me flat out it IS my fault and I should hate and kill myself. Deep down I do know that none of this would have  happened had it not been for me. It IS my fault and I will never be forgiven or forgotten for it.

0	positive	loss-to-suicide	So, here's the thing. I haven't lost someone to suicide. I'm the suicidal one here. I only came here to ask you guys one thing. What did you feel when you lost your loved one? Because right now, the only reason I'm still alive is that I don't want my mom to get hurt. I just can't take it anymore. I wrote a letter to her, telling her not to worry because when I die, all this pain will finally disappear and I'll finally be happy. I'm just not sure if I should do it or not. I don't want to do it, but I love my mom. I love her more than anything.

I enjoy my alone time but I wish I had more friends, can anyone think of how I might deal with sensors who clash with my intuition, or any other reasons people might dislike an INFJ?

Then I start to tell myself to talk to people more and be more active, to force myself to communicate, but then it's really difficult, and it just doesn't fit, to talk to those people with a total different personality. Even if someone I don't know talked to me, I don't feel comfortable. Like: I hope not.

I really can't get any work done in the morning because of it. i'm writing this in the middle of the night as i can't sleep and laying on my bed is making me really anxious.  
3	positive	personality-disorder	On december 17 I dound out that I lost my baby at two months pregnant. I know to some this may seem trivial because I wasn't  very far along but its not my first loss in fact its my 3rd. I have lost one a little boy at 5 months and also one in march of this year at only a few weeks. I just feel so low and I feel as if I have nobody. Plus I feel like the peopke around me just wouldn't understand. My boyfriend wont talk to me and I just feel as if im losing my mind. I feel sooo alone. And now my doctor is telling me ill prob need a hysterectomy.  I just need people to talk to that can understand what im feeling.

So please stop judging me because honestly, it's hurtful and I'm sure that you wouldn't want to be judged if you were 30 and pregnant! I can't change what u have done and I don't regret it.

Hurt on purpose, or worse, do as if you stop being what you are, to make them feel better, which doesn't work.

And for those in wheelchairs, they can't help that either. Me for example, I'm a disabled handicap with no girlfriend no real friends or a real life. And besides people don't see the up side to us handicapswe can protect our women more then the walking people can by running them over. But just wait, people that mess disabled people will soon possibly turn out like them. Maybe not today or tomorrow, but soon and everyone that might get rid of their disabilities will eventually come across that person and pick on them

I can get interested in things, but anything that should make me happy won't and I don't know what to do about it. My PTSD stems from years abused and stuff in my childhood, there's no one incident that's caused it. I don't know what to do, I'm 30 now and I just keep getting more withdrawn and emotionally dead. I'm scared I won't be able to keep living. How can I recover? I'm desperate, pot is the only way I can even be calm half the time.

It's kind of funny. I run an account on insta to stop bullying and stop people from committing suicide but I'm wondering if it's my only escape. I'm not pretty, I don't do any sports, I can't draw, can't play any instruments, I don't have anything in special, but I still Hold on to life. I want to leave so badly to be with my loved ones who died but I'm still her and at the same time I don't want to leave. I always feel that I was sent to life for something big. I want to leave a legacy and a meaning to my name, but I have no idea how to. Life will just have To go on..

0	positive	ptsd	Tired of it all..It seems like I'm perfectly fine but far from it. Battling this depression since childhood, flashbacks of horrible things fill my head constantly. I could be thinking of a egg sandwich and FLASH, FLASH, FLASHLoss of appetite, mood change. I try my absolute hardest to block the bad stuff out and get nowhere every time. No one that would be able to help understands or the magnitude of it all. I just want one whole minute of this happening to me. I understand people around the world may have it much worse than I do but I just don't know where to start to cease this problem, along with a lifetime of other battles I face everyday. When I catch myself complaining, I get so angry and want to do self harm, but I'm too chicken and wouldn't actually do anything. So I sit here, sharing depressing stories because that's all I can do

1	positive	ptsd	When you have had a very unhealthy relationship for over 20 years with someone what do you do when it affects other people? I have recently cut my mom off. I cant do this unhealthy relationship anymore. It doesn't mean I don't love her. It just means I want to be happy in my life. Sometimes you have to love from a distance. Mean while there are three kids that are being hurt in the process. I don't think that it should involved them at all but they are involved sadly. So what do you do? How do you explain this situation to them? They don't understand and I don't want to get into details with them till they are older maybe. Idk

1	positive	regrets	There's not a single soul on this earth that doesn't have a regret.. and the truth is, I have a lot of them. I've learned from them though and I've grown from them. I regret being the bully.. and I regret being the bullied. I regret breaking hearts, and having mine broken. I regret spewing hateful words, and swallowing someone elses, but I don't regret the outcome of all of it. I wouldn't be the person I am, and I wouldn't have such a big heart.
0	positive	regrets	The side I so long to keep  --I love myself, and all my sides.
0	positive	regrets	The worst regret of all is one you can't fix because the person died.  Replaying it over and over hoping the pain will lessen.  Hoping for forgiveness and wishing for the moment again.  Grief, regret and a hurt so bad life will never be the same.  Always remember it really may be your last time with someone.

1	positive	regrets	To many to count! I regret it.

0	positive	regrets	We all have at some point . Don't lie
1	positive	regrets	We all mistakes. Some are more serious than others, some follow us around for the rest of our lives no matter what we do to try to make up for it. I made a mistake with that type of consequence. I have learned from it and I regret it deeply, like others like me if I could go back in time and change it I certainly would. I would have never done those things, I would have never said those things, I would never have let things go that far I wouldn't have even let them start. Some people are nice enough to try to convince me that it is not my fault. Others tell me it's not COMEPLETELY my fault. Most aren't nice at all and tell me flat out it IS my fault and I should hate and kill myself. Deep down I do know that none of this would have  happened had it not been for me. It IS my fault and I will never be forgiven or forgotten for it.

1	positive	revenge Confessions	because I do not. My heart does not belong to you. But I would be lying if I said I didn't want you. That I didn't dream of you. That I didn't seek you out. That I didn't strain to feel your heat when you are near me. That you don't take my breath away. That my flesh would not sear beneath your touch. I know nothing of you. If you are married. If you have a family. If you notice the pains I take for your attention. It is difficult, because I will not speak with you of such things. Because I love another. But if you did not need my love, I could give you heaven.

0	positive	revenge Confessions	I fear lack of acceptance for my different Quranist views. I fear people being offended and telling me I'm not Muslim. I fear not being allowed into Mecca, where they don't let non-Muslims in. I just keep my mouth shut around everyone.I don't understand when I listen to the women around me, talking about how much they'd love it if they moved to countries like Saudi Arabia. Do all the human rights abuses not disturb them? The need to get male permission for everything, and ban on women driving?Or people allying themselves with the causes of other countries they have no ties to. Issues that have nothing to do with religion.I fear if I do find acceptance here, it won't translate to elsewhere. I'll make it to Mecca and manage to mess up horribly somehowThat will all be far in the future. But if I mess up here in the US it's a loooooong way off to find another mosque

Idon't know that it will ever be filled, but I'm so tired of trying and of wanting what I can't have. If I could only just let it go..
1	positive	revenge Confessions	I have no regard or any feelings whatsoever about human life. I don't actively wish bad things upon people in general, but I just don't care. I feel nothing to them. There are one or two people i do feel something for, but it's not very deep. My father calls me every so often wanting to hang out, see how I'm doing. I usually tend to ignore his calls and shrug it off. I want to tell him I don't feel anything for him, not even gratitude for raising me in a clean stable home, but I know it would cause nothing but trouble and I don't feel up to dealing with that headache. I would like to confess it to him so he'd stop calling, and realize I just don't care, but he'd simply do what most fathers do and try to get involved or try to convince me to see a therapist, or visit me in person more often. I only live 20 minutes away and he doesn't understand why I never visit, except when forced to on holidays.

3	positive	revenge Confessions	I think about killing people all the time. Every day. I imagine pushing my fellow commuters in front of trains every morning. When I sit down behind someone I imagine grabbing their hair, pulling their head back and slicing their throat. I think about stabbing people on the street. Cutting the faces of little kids, or breaking peoples legs with a baseball bat. These thoughts consume me on a daily basis. I don't know what to do to stop it. I see a therapist, and it helps but, the thoughts still happen. I'm afraid that one day I'll act on them.

0	positive	revenge Confessions	The look in your eyes in unforgetable. It's mix of adoration, love, passion, lust. It gives away the battle within you. The soft caring side, vs. your animalistic passionate side. Do you take my face in your hands and ever so gently let your lips taste mine? Or do you grab me and kiss me with a passion that says, "We may never have this chance again"? I feel your hot breath on my neck as we embrace. I can feel your heart beating more and more rapidly in your chest as your breathing becomes more erratic. You pull back and look at me again. Our eyes lock. We tremble in our skin. The electricity between us is incomprehensible. What do you do? friends Confessions

2	positive	revenge Confessions	The only reason i don't like going to that one place is because it's so hard for me to get home unlike you guys, so i make out that i just don't like being there because it's weird. You always go down there with your boyfriend and most of our friends, and you don't even tell me anymore, i'm just expected to sit at home whilst you all have fun. It wouldn't be so bad if i had other friends, other people who wanted to see me, but i don't, and so most weekends i feel pretty * because you just don't bother now. I know it's my own fault because i don't like going, but it'd be nice if you at least asked, or told me, or didn't invite everyone so as i can't even go out.

Though bound, and paralyzedunable to step forward, I feel those pulses. A leap of my heart, a sink of the stomach, a click of the brain. A spur of tingling surges form a crown on my skull, shooting down my spine and back from where they just were. Or to a new destination. I don't know many thingsI just know what I feel. The vibes And I can't stop feeling youI should have never touched you for so long.

I need someone to understand. Because it hurts being reminded all the time of just how broken you really are. And it's sick, feeling like making more every time you see something sharp. Every time your arm starts to itch, and you know the only way to make it stop is to just give in. I hate it. I hate feeling so disgusted with myself for them, and I hate when I do hurt myself again to make it stop. I just hate them. And I wish they'd go away, so I can at least pretend I'm not quite as broken as I am.

It traps 1/3 of the fat and carbs from your meal without those "messy" side effects!  I keep them in my purse and take them everywhere!  I most definitely had them with me at Thanksgiving and will most definitely have them with me at Christmas when all the yummy Holiday food will be around!  Yay for Fat Fighters!  They're like food ninjas! HA!

0	positive	self-harm	I'm a 40 yr old mom of 2, and looking for someone who can help me, and ways to stay strong at this almost impossible time in my life (age) to loose a couple of pounds.  I need to stay motivated and someone to help me when I get weak.  My goal is to lose 25lbs, and have been getting nowhere with working out, I need more.  It was easier to do when I was younger but now I can't seem to control my hunger pains without food.
0	positive	self-harm	I'm about to be engaged and I'm finding out that as an introvert I need to have a couple of days of alone time in my apt a week or I get really irritable and feel almost claustrophobic and start pushing her away. Thoughts/advice?
1	positive	self-harm	I'm a couple days from cutting.. I'm suffocating, I can't breathe again. It's agony. I wanna feel again, the adrenaline & pain keeps me afloat. I promised I wouldn't. But it wouldn't be the first time I broke that promise. Is broken it millions of times to everyone but I can't let go. I need it, I'm sick & lost & confused and cutting grounds me. It channels all my anger and pain & I like it. It's sick isn't it? I like cutting, it gives me a sense of peace. God I'm messed up in the end. I just wanna feel something again & I wanna stop wondering around with no purpose.

0	positive	self-harm	I'm not going into details , but I hate it 
0	positive	self-harm	Im often alone so Im used to it and its not just because being alone is forced upon me. i often seek it out, just wanting time and space to think and collect my thoughts. To listen to music via headphones and shut everything and everyone out. The world is a scary place and I dont really fit so being alone stops all the crap in this world infesting my space. Dont misunderstand me, I get lonely too but having that alone time is important to me. I need it to recover, to reboot my thoughts and feelings.

0	positive	self-harm	I really like this girl but we haven't talked in months it all started freshman year where we for the second time met each other and we just started to talk and text each other all the time and we started to get each other and we both made each other laugh every single day and all of a sudden she stopped texting around the summer of my sophomore year and that's when she started to be really busy. every time I texted her she was busy and apparently she never had time for me anymore and I tried planning a talking date so when can catch up you know and she said sure and the next day I texted (talking date) she never text me until the upcoming morning that she said she was busy and she had homework so I just have up she said that she promise that we will catch up one day but I don't think so because I don't think she wants to talk to me and Idk what to do she I let her go or should I wait for her or something idk I just need help idk what to do!
0	positive	self-harm	I really try not to hate anyone. But he has broken that. He's abusive. He doesn't love me. I told him if he truly loves his children, he'd give up the alcohol. He told me he will never give it up. Do you know how much it hurts to have beer chosen over you? A beverage chosen over your life? Your existence? He's letting my stepdad adopt me. Thank goodness. But only because he won't owe child support anymore. He sees me as nothing but a burden. He is gladly giving me up over money. I'm Stormi, and I hate my father. I hate him and his drunken wife and I hate that he is allowed to keep custody of my little sister. I hate how he guiltlessly left physical wounds on me. I hate how he can give me up without batting an eye. I hate how he willingly neglects me. I hate him. It's wrong. But I do.
1	positive	self-harm	I really want to stop cutting but i don't know how It's so addictive and i really want to stop it but i feel like i can't do it!! It's so hard!

1	positive	self-harm	I used to cut myself all of the time, but it never did make me feel any better. Eventually, I didn't want to do that to myself anymore, found a better, healthier habit to do (studying), and quit before I was in the full throes of a problem.

0	positive	self-harm	I've been cutting since I was about twelve. There have been so many people in my life who have tried to help but they give up on me. I feel bad that I can never go more than a couple weeks without cutting. It's been about 2 weeks since I've picked up a blade and I feel so tempted to right now.
1	positive	self-harm	I've cut for a whole but just recently it's been really bad. I sit there and debate if I should do it or not and in the end it's the only thing I can do to not explode. I've tried to stop quite a few times but it always ended up being my last resort.

0	positive	self-harm	Let me just list a few things I like doing: running long distances, woodworking, photography, podcasting, writing, meeting new people, teaching others, thinking, spending time with my family, having quiet personal time, debating topics that I have personal thoughts on or ones that I don't even care much about (it's the intellectual challenge that I like), conversing with others who like to think and who are able to discuss life and experiences without getting upset, and more and more.
1	positive	self-harm	Many years ago, he was handsome and charming but also very manipulative and convincing with his lies and stories. They drag you in, use you, then spit you out with no thought for your feelings.  Listen to your 'gut' feeling.
4	positive	self-harm	My hands are shaking. My stomach hurts. My wrist itches. I need to open the razor. I need to get them out. I need to press the metal hard against my skin and pull. Right across my arm. I need it. I want it. Please. Can this stop. I don't want pain but I inflict it on myself. I need it. Or suicide is my other option.
2	positive	self-harm	My mom and her boyfriend abuse me and call me names. I need to feel relief. I also don't want to get yelled at by my friends and be called attention seeker and loser by my so called "friend". Plus, I haven't done anything for almost a month now. But, all my methods aren't helping me. I NEED to get a blade. I need to not feel pain. But, they took everything sharp away cuz they don't trust me.

0	positive	suicide	But I don't want to throw a pity party or a supposed one in the process. Suicide pains me, I've been there once, but I want to care for these people, not pity them. Besides, I'm pretty sure pity is the last thing they want. When suicide comes up, I feel a light pain in my heart and I almost feel like crying, because no one should feel like uninstalling themselves from this world is the only option or one the main options they have left.

Yeah people call me pretty but not in it's actual sense. They call me hot. Why cant i be a teddy bear instead of a barbie. Why anybody do not care to put their hands in my head instead of my hips. Why can't i just have some friend instead of some boyfriend.   
0	positive	suicide	I am now only 14 and I have been bullied my hole life, but last year it got worse my parents split up and my bully was hurting me more this one day he really gave it to me and when I got home I started to slice away and then I thought of my way out, I had never thought of it before, but then I thought about my family and friends and how much it would hurt for them and I couldn't bring myself to do it and I'm glad! I get bullied less now and my life is going good.  Thank you and have a great day  &lt;3

0	positive	suicide	I give up on things. Does anybody know a quick, easy way to kill yourself? Preferably with pills in my sleep?
3	positive	suicide	I hate when people get in relationships because they feel lonely or feel like they need someone. How can you truly love someone if you can't love yourself? Then you force yourself into a relationship that won't last and you get hurt because your own selfishness.
0	positive	suicide	I have been single for 20 years spend a lot of time with myself with that time I have learned to love myself fully  I leaned of being alone and being ok with I learned of being independent and still be able to ask for help I learned about my strengths and weaknesses and I found myself in being alone with myself I don't need somebody els to define who I am but I will like to be a part of somebody els life.

0	positive	suicide	I just want to die I don't feel like trying anymore. ):
2	positive	suicide	I love you so much, you don't love me.  I don't know what to do anymore. The only thing I can do is cry. Nothing goes right for me. I don't feel anything will go right for the rest of my life. I feel like I just want to kill myself. I'm done with feeling hurt and unwanted. I think I'm just gonna end it all.
0	positive	suicide	I'm 15 I have never had a girlfriend, I'm anti-social my only friend is music I am an outcast in society everyone hates me and I'm just sick and tired of feeling invisable to everyone, I want to die so badly but I bring myself to slit my wrists or hang myself, I'm week and pathetic I am a waste of space, If someone were to walk in right now with a gun I would beg them to shoot me, maby tonight my prayers will be answered and I'll die in my sleep

2	positive	suicide	I miss my baby Bailey. My dad took her to the pound because I was starting school and wouldn't be home all day to take care do her and he didn't want to do it 
0	positive	suicide	I'm not scared of death, only the pain that comes with it. I can't wait to be free, no more suffering. I'm ready to go to the other side
1	positive	suicide	I'm pretty sure there isn't one. At least not for me. I'm just exhausted. I don't want to wake up anymore. I don't want to go to school, or write, or talk to people. I don't want to go to college. I don't want to be a teacher. I don't want to read. I don't care. If there was a was to kill yourself without pain that I had access to, I'd have killed myself at least fifty times over by now. I'm probably underestimating. I hate being alive. I don't want to eat or drink or get dressed. I want to be dead. I don't want to worry about anything or have to make decisions or to work or go to school. I don't want to be social. I want to die, and thats it.

0	positive	suicide	In bed all the time because of my disease. . I can't get away. And I would have nowhere to go anyway. This world has become so horrible. Everyone suing for everything. People lying. And ruining medical help I need because no dr wants to get sued. So thank you to all the druggies, and liars who ruin it for honest people.
1	positive	suicide	I need a girl to be physical oh my why I'm so desperate today pls help
0	positive	suicide	I really don't see a reason not to. I feel as if I have no future and living would just cause me to be more miserable. I find it hard to believe that people love and care about me, so why not? I feel really conflicted.
1	positive	suicide	I really just want someone that I feel gets me. Can push me when needed and knows when to back off. I need my person.
1	positive	suicide	Is having no physical contact, as someone with Aspergers, something to think is a big loss and be upset or is it not such a big thing?
0	positive	suicide	Is this the end? I don't know. When did the pins become razors, when did the food become alcohol? When did the room become my sanctuary and my prison? I don't get it, I don't want to die, but I don't want to live either. I want to wake up, and have this pain be gone.  I don't think I belong here.
2	positive	suicide	I think about it quite often but I'm too scared to do it. I don't want other people to get hurt and I also think a lot about what would happen I'd survive. Everytime someone leaves me or push me away it gets worse. I can't help myself but cry, I'm too weak to live and there's no place in this world for people like me. I wish I was dead I wish I could disappear
0	positive	suicide	It hurts too much to keep living. Why should I stay here miserably just for my parents? I have nothing. Nobody would miss me, they wouldn't even notice I was gone until maybe months later. My life is so pathetic. I hate myself. 
0	positive	suicide	It's been so long since I've gotten high.. I miss it.
2	positive	suicide	I used to think about it a lot especially when I was younger even know I still have thoughts. But not as bad as when I was younger because I would plan it and gather things but I could never kill myself, I'm to scared that I will miss something if I don't stay. When I die I die but cutting it short isn't an option for me no matter how much I think about it
1	positive	suicide	I've been going through this for too long, and I still don't fully understand or know what's happening. It's a game to them. Lets do this, that, mess with her head even though somethings wrong with her. Try to figure it out. Oh well if wee talked to her and pretended to be okay with her for ten yeas while we ALL already knew we'd get our points across. I don't care if they hate me, but why not just leave me alone? Why must they do what they did to me? I can't wait until I just crash. 
0	positive	suicide	I've been so down lately I'm hardly ever happy anymore. Somedays I struggle to get out of bed. I'm miserable any suggestions?
0	positive	suicide	I've recently come to Uni and have made a good group of friends, they know that i have history of depression but they get upset when i don't ask them for help. I just don't like asking for help..what do i do?
0	positive	suicide	I've tied killing myself before but it never worked out, pills, bleeding out nothing. I wish I would die in my sleep I wouldn't feel bad about the few people who'd miss me cause I wouldn't have done it to myself, every week is a repeating cycle of neutrality  and then deep depression, if my breath where to slowly stop and my heart's pulse decrease every second I'd die with a smile on my face while I sleep. My brain, heart, and soul are already dead and I hate faking the life I try to represent in my false smiles

4	positive	suicide	I was in 4th grade when I first tried committing suicide. Been ever since. I wish I could die, but my biggest fear is I will succeed. I need help, parents don't help, friends don't, teachers & counselers don't, I don't know where to go. Or who i am.
0	positive	suicide	I wish i was dead. I am worthless. There is no point in life, you live then you die thats it. I hate my sister shes the worst sister ever! She hits me and shouts at me for no flipping reason. I hate myself. I am so ugly and can't even look at myself in the mirror if i do i get this feeling and just don't like my face. Im not gonna succeed in life. I wish i wasn't born. I just want to get away from this world. I want to commit suicide.

It's kind of funny. I run an account on insta to stop bullying and stop people from committing suicide but I'm wondering if it's my only escape. I'm not pretty, I don't do any sports, I can't draw, can't play any instruments, I don't have anything in special, but I still Hold on to life. I want to leave so badly to be with my loved ones who died but I'm still her and at the same time I don't want to leave. I always feel that I was sent to life for something big. I want to leave a legacy and a meaning to my name, but I have no idea how to. Life will just have To go on..

0	positive	unemployment	At 46 years of age with at least 20 years of work experience you would think that this would not be the case. Unfortunately with things as they are now, gaps in your employment history gets your application kicked to the trash instantly. Just found out that focusing on the years of employment that have no gaps still gets you no where because then you don't have enough experience. Not married, with no kids and no siblings and unable to find steady employment, the struggle becomes one not to give up completely. Being stuck living with a parent and  HER parent who is also alzheimer's the clock is ticking on how long things can stay like this before everyone in this house is stark staring mad.

I need funding to buy wood to help build shelter, blankets to keep them warm, and cat food to give to them everyday. I wish I was able to afford saving thousands of cats, but I can't. Thats why I need your help.If you love cats like I do, then please help out. Visit the link below for more information. If you cannot make any donations, please spread the word! Thank you so much for your time. Feel free to leave suggestions and ideas!

No one that would be able to help understands or the magnitude of it all. I just want one whole minute of this happening to me. I understand people around the world may have it much worse than I do but I just don't know where to start to cease this problem, along with a lifetime of other battles I face everyday. When I catch myself complaining, I get so angry and want to do self harm, but I'm too chicken and wouldn't actually do anything. So I sit here, sharing depressing stories because that's all I can do

3	positive	work Confessions	I've started smoking when, if I was still 15, I would have cut myself. I don't enjoy it. Well, that's not fair. It stinks awfully, and burns unpleasantly. I always feel like a terrible hypocrite afterwards, besides. But that it's painful in a way I don't enjoy and could make me ill is really very soothing. I don't like doing it, but I don't like the near schizophrenia I dip into at times, either. Hurting myself, somehow, levels me out.
1	positive	work Confessions	I wanna place my hand at the small of your back and pull you into me. Your womanhood pressed firmly against mine. I want to gaze lovingly into your eyes. I wanna twist your hair around my wrist and firmly yet gently pull your head back and devour your neck. I wanna feel you shudder as my lips graze and tickle your ear. I also wanna bury my face in your shoulder and cry. I miss you

3	positive	work Confessions	Just a hole where my heart used to be. Indifference will fill this gaping crevice. I don't give a * about love anymore. Will be a good mom and help those who actually need it. No more. Family, making money, having fun, and  helping others. That will keep me busy and content. I don't even miss lovemaking anymore, it has been so long I just don't care. If I don't date can't fall in love. If you are on here I take back everything I said. The good and the not so good. You are not even a memory but a mistake.

I'm sorry for leaving you. I'm sorry for abandoning you.I'm sorry for fighting. I'm sorry I wasn't there for you, I truly apologize. My brain cannot handle my guilt and the constant thoughtt of what could have been. I regret what I did; I hurt you. I didn't mean it, honest. I don't know what I want exactly, but I do know one thing. I want you to be happy.

4	positive	work Confessions	Missing you is something I never thought would happen again. Miles away and leaving soon you aren't even mine, but I worry (I always worry). The music, the pictures, the letters, they are all gone, but the memory of us isn't. I can't, I shouldn't miss you the way I do and I know you don't feel the same. I just pretend since you are just a friend that maybe one day you will miss me too. Maybe one day the letters will start again. Maybe one day everything will make sense.

0	positive	work Confessions	My fiance is a diabetic and he got these really bad blisters on his feet. Well, they became infected at the beginning of the week. He didn't want me to call the doctor. Now I can't get an appointment and it's getting worse. I'm so mad that he didn't listen. I'm worried and angry and I feel bad for being angry, but this is a grown man with a brain. I know this is not the best time, but I feel like leaving him right now. He doesn't listen when it comes to this kind of stuff. I just want to scream. I feel bad for the way I feel about this, but it makes me feel like he doesn't care about the way I feel about his health and the pain it causes me. Maybe I'm just being over dramatic, but this is really bothering me

0	positive	work Confessions	Not too long ago, I didn't think I was ready to have children. I thought I myself was a bit too much of a child. Things have changed. Not only do I feel more ready to have children, but I feel like less of a child. I want a child, but not without a partner and a committed relationship (ideally a marriage). I don't want all of this right away, but I will. I'm not who I was. What a transformation.
