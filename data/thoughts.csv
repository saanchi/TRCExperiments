This conversation is going into the gutter fast.  Do not ever let him talk to the customer again.
I'll never get her to understand where i am coming from
Of course this shit would happen to me!
"""I miss my dad."""
I feel so bad for her right now. She must be so emarrassed. I hope the kids on her didn't tease her. I feel like yelling at the kid who did thus.
How can they do that so impersonally?  I'm never working a virtual job again!!
That man is dead. I'm seeing a dead body.
Oh boy, is Dan going to get mad at me for this one!
I could not understand why she was following me.
How dare she ruin that project by pretending she's qualified. She should know better, and needs to learn that she's not as smart as she would like to think.
At first I was in denial and thought I could get it to work again, but then I realized that it wasn't going to.  I got very angry and frustrated and then decided to go to bed.  There were no words in this situation.
Why???? After all the work I've done is nothing selling?????
Why does it have to be like this?  I really am alone in this world.  They are so lucky to be able to go.
Stop. Stop thinking about it.
This cannot be that important. Why do you have to call when you know it's bedtime? I don't believe this. This is so ridiculous!
I can't deal with this. I want it to end.
How dare he do that to me and I will not le thim slide with it.
He always wants people to think he's such a good guy instead of a jerk.
At first I was shocked, then I was angry and then for a brief period I was sad.   2 days later I was extremely relieved.
He is so annoying he always thinks of himself.
I'll never be good enough to be her mother
I thought I was going to lose one of my closest friends, forever.
I think she may be hurt
I can't believe she will never be able to ride with me again. I miss her so very much.
"""I need tranquilizers for these little monsters. """

Thought
Oh lord, I hope she's ok!  I need to know what's going on!  Please let her be ok!!!
How will I be able to solve my financial issues?
This is so not fair!  We are never going to be able to get ahead!
Why is this happening to me
Why doesn't he want to help me?
I always get cancelled on or left out.
This is going to ruin my life
HOW COULD THIS HAPPEN? THIS IS SO SUDDEN AND UNEXPECTED
I cannot believe my family left me out.
"All I could think was ""Oh No"".  I was very sad and upset."
I am so sick of this guy.
My father no longer has any siblings alive and I cannot help him from feeling so alone.  I feel so sad seeing him cry.
How am I going to be able to pay for my bills?
How was I stupid enough to end up here?
I might kill myself.
Lonely, Empty (when looking at the bed, and the feeling in my arms), Longing, Envy from earlier that day (seeing friends in couples all happy together, and being the only single one in the group), Also, rage and anger at the negativity and criticism coming from friends who constantly put down my relationship and claim that the long distance relationship, *especially* with a man in the military won't work (despite the fact that I am no stranger to distance and time zones).
I never should've gone in the first place. I'll never be able to get those friends I made back--why would they want to be friends with someone who already walked away without a word? And I won't make any new ones like them, either, because I'll never be able to go back to school and be successful. Why should I keep on going? I've already ruined my life.
She must not like me for some reason.
Please dont go.

I felt angry about the fact that this company was trying to charge me so much for something that isn't even my fault.
Why is my brain shutting down.
I can't do this
God hates me so much!
I cant keep doing this

Thought
Is there any way I can pay for them to come to the wedding?
I hope that they don't think I don't belong here..
He thinks he's entitled to my help. There's always something he wants me to do and I'm tired so he can go to hell.
Content. Peaceful. At ease. Mindless.
she ignored what i said!
I wish he wasn't so late, he's always late, does he even care?
That I wanted to get up and quit. I was so angry because he was telling me I couldn't eat. I was sad because I was getting picked on when everyone else was eating while on the phone.
They are not returning my phone call because they don't want to help me.
I'll never get the hang of this job.
Damnit, why, hell, not again
Why would they fire someone as nice as her? She was dedicated to the company, and helped out a lot of people.
This guy will not listen. He is being a jerk. I should tell him off. No, I should keep my cool. Everyone is on edge right now, so I need to keep a thick skin.
"""She always does this shit to me."""
"I thought ""She must be mad at me for some reason, which I do not know"""
I THOUGHT HE WAS BEING SO RUDE AND IT MADE ME VERY ANGRY
no this motherfucker didnt eat my food out the refrig
She's going to leave me.
He doesn't like me.
I feel so stupid, se probably thinks im stupid.
Ugh, I always do this I'm such an idiot I shouldn't have been so careless I'm a bad friend
Oh, shit!!!  I need to call the restaurant and add 12 more seats to our reservation. I hope they can do it.

Thought
Why doesn't anyone ever listen to me?
I felt like I was losing my best friend.  A friend that had lived with me for 18 years.
I was just angry and disappointed in myself
I am an idiot and completely stupid. I should be fired and never hired anywhere else becaue of my incompetence..
I cannot believe these people would have so little respect for me that they think I am here just for them and my time should revolve around them.
the friend was out of line
She likes someone else.
I can't get anything right. I just failed that class.
I should know how to be more careful about issues pertaining to money. I thought I'm always so careful.
"I was thinking  ""I just know I'm embarrassing myself"""
I'll never get a job. I'm not qualified. I'm not good enough.
anxious, get out of here. flight over took fight.
I was scared that I was going to get into trouble or fired from my job
I saw them on the streets on the way to the concert and felt anxious already to see them because it had been a while, and then I felt anxious because I felt like they viewed me as having done something wrong,
The management here sucks and I cant believe they don't care enough abou  these people.
She is ignoring me. She is disrespecting me. I'm going to have to put my foot down.
I hope the student isn't upset with me. I hope that my coworker replies soon so the student doesn't yell at me. I really don't like when the students get upset with me when it's not my fault.

I bet I failed it. I'm so stupid.
why would she say that to me?  She never talked to me like that before.
I don't understand why nothing I'm doing to try to cheer her up seems to be working.
She must think I am a horrible mother.
This is going to cost me a lot of money! These plumbers charge you $200 just to show up, and the time and supplies are on top of that. I feel stuck between a leak, a problem, and a shark.
How could he allow her to drench herself in dirt. He was suppose to be watching her play outside with her cousins. If he was going to let them play like pigs she could have changed into play clothes because he know I do not have money to replace items at any given moment. I brought her over to visit after school and went back home a mess with no apology but he do not care as long as the kids did not bother him.
I don't think I will ever get over this.
Thought
I don't think these people understand my presenation. They look bored with it.
We're going to lose everything!
"I felt helpless. I thought ""I'll never get another job and I'm going to be homeless."""
Why don't they respect me enough to just talk to me about issues?
I'll hope there is more with this job
I have nowhere else to go if my parents don't want me; I don't want to be homeless.
She must think that I am not good enough to have a faithful girlfriend
My parents are going to kill me.
I can't afford this
I was thinking of how I could get her back
I should confront this idiot and show him the same disrespect he shows me and my wife.
He is so upset and disappointed with me, I hope he doesn't fire me!
To remain levelheaded and respond without any emotional queues.
I may really lose my job, I have no control over this and it's left in the hands of the state.
Dumb, idot, stupid
I can't believe I just said that.
My parents are going to kill me.
I can't believe this is happening. Is she really talking and treating me like this after every thing I've done for her.
God dammit, I hate traffic. I can't stand being late.
She might not make it out and I might lose my sister.
I want to make this work, but she doesn't seem to want to.
I can't do this anymore. I can't get it all done. I can't.
I want to yell and scream at my father. I want to destroy the place so I can never return.
What am i doing here
maybe i should break this off before it gets any worse
Thought
Is there another girl?
What can I do? How do I get myself out of this situation?
I'll never make it, I'll never be good enough, I cannot take this test again, I'll never do it
These men are going to kill my boyfriend and I and no one will care because we're gay and everyone hates us
i need to run away
Why?  Is he not qualified enough?  Did he do something wrong?
I thought we were friends, I hope I didn't do/say something to upset her and I just can't remember what it was.
She doesn't seem as upset as I am, so does she really like me still?
my exact thought was i feel like an idiot
there is no time. get as much done before it is too late. finish what we can.
she must not love me any more
"""I shouldn't have reacted like that."""
"""I can't understand why they are making these accusations when I have worked so hard."""
She is going to get reamed for not noticing this, and then shes going to kill me for not telling her.
I can't believe this is happening to me
My thoughts were that the right-wing financial bosses at the company's headquarters had ruined my career and severely damaged my financial situation just to save few bucks. All this in a billion dollar company. I thought about the times I had worked above and beyond the requirements without extra pay or praise just to solve unforeseen problems in the radio station. I cursed the backstabbers and mental midgets that I worked for knowing that professionally and intellectually I was better than them. I kept remembering the concepts of the Peter Principle that I learned 40 years earlier.
Is this what i really want to do?
I am terrible at sales.
I wish I could cut myself.
We could die in a tornado. Where could we go if there is a tornado? What if I die? What if I live and my husband dies?
She needs to be fired.
Everyone is way too close to me and I can't see everyone at the same time, someone is always behind me
I am not a good wife since my husband does not want to come home. Why do I put up with his nonsense?
"I find myself saying, and saying it alot,""I hate my Life!"""
I'm gonna fail this test?  I really hate this class why did I take it.
